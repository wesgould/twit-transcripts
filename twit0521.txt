[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   That's mean.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I didn't take very long on that.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   No, I thought I'd kick it right off at the beginning.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Bloomberg.com/tech.

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I see you all the time now.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Which is great.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And Owen.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   J.J.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Stone, Marshall artist.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Television star.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Somebody, somebody superimposed on this.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Will work for Tech.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Will work for Tech.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   What the hell is that?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That is huge.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It's a touch whack on tablet.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Because, you know, again, Uncle Leo.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Michael, do you want serious work?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Is that like a centique kind of thing?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It is.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's the cheaper one.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's the 13 inch.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Cheap centique.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Multi-touch.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So you're also an artist?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Yes.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Besides just looking good, I'm actually kind of smart.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   A man in many talents.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And a master of none.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Do you have a shield tablet there?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Because if you do, you better watch out.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   It might blow up and catch fire.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I think only four people in America have a shield tablet.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   The recall wasn't great.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   The recall is not great.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Yeah, no.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   They say how many they're going to have to recall.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's a fire hazard.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   They sold four.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   They sold four.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I know some people who bought these because this was a very fast tablet designed for gaming
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   primarily.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And a lot of people were seeing in its praises.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   But those sold between July 2014 and July 2015, which is now, might have a little problem.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You should look for the battery section and see if it's B01.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.600]   If it is, you can use it.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.760]   If it's Y01, you should arrange a replacement as soon as possible.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.320]   Our public service announcement on behalf.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.000]   I have the Nvidia Shield Android TV and I love it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It's great.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   88,000.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's the newer one, right?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It's kind of like a game console.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah, basically.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I think it has sort of like a cloud gaming service that you can download like console games.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   They have like an Nvidia has like an online type thing where it's like a game console.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It's like a live type thing where it streams the games to the device.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I haven't played that.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I should really try it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   I haven't played it yet.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I've played it.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It's pretty good.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It's not bad.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It's mostly like PlayStation 3 games like last year games.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's older games, yeah.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   But they're fun and there's not a lot of hiccups.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I have an Xbox one right next to it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I feel like that's all I need.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   That's better.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   That's all.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   You know what else I have?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Right here, my hip flask?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Copy a window is 10.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   How do you guys have that right there?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   You have a gun holster.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Yeah, you've got a holster.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You've got a gun holster.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I am fast.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Windows 10 came out on Wednesday.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   That looks nice.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I like the UI.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I love it.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   They brought back the start menu.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Now it does have some tiles on it, but you can customize it.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Ask me anything.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Ask Cortana.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   They're using like the Reddit tagline.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   AMA, I never thought of that.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Anything to get people to use Bing.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I have to say, I think Microsoft finally got a version of Windows that is as good as Windows
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   7.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Windows 8 was a little bit of a disappointment.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Huge, massive.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   This is pretty good.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Now they said 67 million people so far.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   14 million in the first day did the upgrade.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I think that that's limited only by, yeah, this is a touch.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   That's limited only by Microsoft's bandwidth, I guess, because there's a lot of people
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   who could use this because there are roughly 600 million people who could use this.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   This is the new Edge browser.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Not really ready yet.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It doesn't support plugins.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And so for that reason, Microsoft continues to include Internet Explorer.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And everyone will still use Chrome.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And immediately, what did I download?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I downloaded Chrome first.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   That's one of those things.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You have infinite funds.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Just work on it and get it ready when you launch something.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Because making someone use something else in the meantime is going to make them forget
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   about whatever new thing you're going to do.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Like, once they already put it out of their mind, when they get something new, they're
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   going to forget about it.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   You know, it's an interesting question because when they first announced that they were going
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   to release Windows 10 in 2015, they said fall.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   They said later in the year.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And then all of a sudden, contrary to everybody's expectations, they said, you know, July 29th.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And I have a feeling that they still intend to finish it and fall in the fall.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Threshold 2, which is the big service pack that will still be out of the fall.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Mary Jofoli said this on our Windows Weekly Show is probably really the final version.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Well, there's some things that I'm kind of a little irritated by.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   There's like no real compatibility between Office and Windows 10 itself that is any
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   different than Windows 8 and Office.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's just kind of like they haven't leveraged all of their OneDrive, you know, cloud, you
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   know, system.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Apparently OneDrive is still troubling to on Windows 10.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It just seems as though the Microsoft, you know, Windows team and the Office team aren't really
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   quite communicating the way they should.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Right.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   It's kind of a crappy user experience.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Microsoft did want to ship it with Skype built in.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It still doesn't.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   You have to download a copy of Skype.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I think the next version probably will.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And I already took the Candy Crush Saga tile off of here.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   But good news, Candy Crush Saga is not downloaded.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It just puts a tile up saying, do you want it?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And you send, they'll get them to go to the store and download it.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It feels fast.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It's snappy.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It probably should be at least as fast if not faster on any machine that can run Windows
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   7 or 8.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I think it's beautiful.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I think it looks good.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And I really think bringing back the start menu and getting rid of the charms bar does
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   a lot towards making this a very usable when instead of the charms bar now they have an
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   action center, which has customizable little icons in the bottom so you can customize it
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   to do the things you want.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   How often do you find yourself with that machine actually touching it in day to day?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Surprisingly a lot.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   You see I'm touching it now.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And you even reached out to touch it.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And this is a nice little gimmick to be able to touch it.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   But I've played around with the Chromebook Pixel a bit over the last year or so.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   They've got the touch built in, but I almost never use it.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I just hate fingerprints on my display.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Well, that's one side effect.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It really does smudge things up.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Have you played your Xbox on it?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I haven't yet.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Paul Therat was doing it while we did Windows Weekly.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   He said it works very well.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   He was playing Call of Duty.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I said, "Come on.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   It's got to be late."
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And he said, "No, I have a fast network, but it's not.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   It's pretty snappy.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Maybe there's a little hesitation."
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Almost got me wanted by Xbox One just so I could try it and play it for that reason.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   You know what?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I feel bad.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I should have tried it.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I feel like if you're going to play games you should play on your Xbox One.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   If you own it and you have to own an Xbox One for this to work, I don't understand it.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   If you just try to go into another room and you want to play during dinner or while you're
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   taking a bath or someplace in a garage, I don't know.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   There's someplace in the house where you might want to play on your big screen.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   It's more if you had a surface or maybe a yogurt, some sort of tablet-y versus Windows.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   You got that Nvidia thing with the game and it's for people like that.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Right.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   So I'm in the bathtub.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I'm at my Surface Pro 3 and I can stream my game and continue to play in the bathtub.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   There you go.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   This is for a world that cannot not play a game for even five minutes.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Which is just this world.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Which is our world.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   The world we...
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   It's just the world we live in.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   We'll see how successful it is.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   It seems like it's gotten off to a pretty strong start.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I haven't heard any showstoppers of unaethin or anybody saying, "No, we actually loaded it at
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   the Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   On a laptop that was about eight years old and it actually felt quicker."
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It really...
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   It was great.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It should.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   It was great.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It should.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I was really, really surprised.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Microsoft successfully done that with the last three versions of Windows.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Seven, eight, and now ten.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   All were a little fast into the previous version which is pretty impressive.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   You're a little computer like that.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   That's a little bit...
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   A feat though.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   It was special.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   It was special.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   There were two big stories and I suspect we're going to see a lot more.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   We're not done seeing these.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Complaining about two things, one is Wi-Fi sense.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Brian Krebs, who was a great security guy and very trustworthy in his blog, Krebs on security,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I think kind of got it wrong.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Warning people that Windows 10 shares your Wi-Fi with contacts.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Now he did write this story July 15th, which means he wasn't using the final version of Windows.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.600]   So let's give you the rundown on Wi-Fi sense.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.000]   First of all, this is an interesting technology.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   The idea originally was to log you into captive portals.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.840]   Those hot spots that require you to see a start page and log in and they were going to fill
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.000]   it with dummy information.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.840]   So it's kind of automatically getting you on open access spots.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.520]   But the other thing it does is it shares, or says, and Brian says we'll do, it shares
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.840]   your Wi-Fi password with friends.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.000]   So when friends come over, they don't, in the password you'd have to do if they wanted
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   to be on your Wi-Fi.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   We do this with visitors to the studios.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.640]   We either say the password is, and now they have your password, or if you want to be kind
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.200]   of protective of it, you take their device, you log them in.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.480]   Or in most people's homes when you get there and like, "Oh, I have to read it off the back
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.480]   of the router."
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.520]   Like when we go back to TV.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.320]   So the idea of Wi-Fi sense was that you could turn it off.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.040]   First of all, you'd have to turn it on, and then it would allow anyone who's in Skype,
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.960]   or Outlook, or Hotmail, or, but you'd have to have a Windows 10 device, either phone,
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.880]   or a Windows 10 computer, would automatically get onto your Wi-Fi network.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.160]   They wouldn't get your password.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.680]   It wouldn't store your password to be a kind of a token that could be revoked by you later.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.160]   But what Brian got wrong is, first of all, you have to turn this on.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.480]   It is turned on by default by Express settings.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.720]   But then you have to go network by network and say, "Yes, share this network."
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.880]   If you don't do that explicitly, it doesn't do anything.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.920]   I think this is not an issue.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.400]   I think it's maybe a little bit, maybe a little bit alarmist.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.960]   It's still a little unclear.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.240]   This is actually a feature that debuted in Windows 8.1, and really wasn't ever very popular.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.760]   They kind of refashioned it in 10.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.440]   And I think the passwords and all this stuff is just shared over encrypted networks anyway.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:29.440]   So I don't know if it's a super, super big deal, but I mean, this is-- Microsoft is promising
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.600]   continual security updates downloading in the background of your operating system so
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.320]   you don't get alerts all the time.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.200]   If there was any issue, this should be something that they've already addressed.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   I don't think there is.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   I'm not sure there is.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.000]   We talked about a little bit on security and ask Steve Gibson wasn't sure.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.680]   As I've played with it, I just feel like this, if you have to opt in twice for this
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.080]   to happen, if you have to opt in twice plus it's all sent over encrypted.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.160]   And it's a token, it's secure.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.040]   Now if somebody comes up with an attack, I'll say I was wrong.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.080]   Maybe that's what Brian is assuming is that there's some sort of fundamental insecurity
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.920]   that might be taken advantage of.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.720]   Everything can get hacked first of all.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.040]   And second of all, I don't even really know why you need that besides the fact that just
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.400]   want to hop on really quick.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.720]   Because normally most people know their passwords.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.160]   Like you said, if you've got to go to that one person's house, get off the back of the
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160]   router, whatever.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.160]   But why even give someone the opportunity to find a hole to drill in, to get in through
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.160]   something else?
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.640]   Like we don't have enough holes already of things.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:36.160]   Brian does update his blog post with a rebuttal from Ed Bott at ZDNet.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.360]   And I think that Ed wrote a pretty good rebuttal about this.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   We've had it on many times.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   I think he's smart.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.560]   I think Brian's smart.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:49.840]   And Brian, I think it points out probably properly that there are potential problems
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.840]   here.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.680]   But it is, you have to opt in several times.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.680]   You're asked several times.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   You want to do this?
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   You want to do this?
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.000]   And the other one that we're going to see a lot more of and is a little bit more insidious
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.800]   is started with the boy genius report.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.360]   And it's about the Windows 10 Yula.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.520]   Here's an example of the kind of headline we'll be seeing a lot of in the next few days.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.400]   Windows 10 is spying on almost everything you do.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:22.800]   As is Facebook, Google, the internet, your phone, NSA, your mom's, like everybody spying
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   on you.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:29.760]   And you tend to see across the technology industry to do more sort of crunching of data within
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   the cloud.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.560]   And your operating system in places you thought traditionally would just be sort of an offline
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.000]   experience, like all done locally on the machine.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.240]   They're now offloading a lot more of that to the cloud.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:50.800]   There was a big blow up when the newest version of Mac OS 10 came out because the spotlight
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.760]   search now sends all of your inputs.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.760]   The cloud, even if your intention is to search for documents on your machine.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:07.040]   And if you use Siri or Google now or I presume Cortana, all of that is sent to the server.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.720]   So I think that that's the point is, and here's where it's a little deceptive.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.880]   So boy genius report quotes a paragraph from Microsoft's Yula that does sound scary.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:24.000]   Finally, we will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your content, such
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.360]   as the content of your emails, other private communications or files and private folders.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.440]   When we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to one, comply with the applicable
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:39.680]   law or to respond to valid legal process or to protect our customers from spam or three
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.440]   operate and maintain the security of our services, including to prevent or stop an attack on
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.880]   our systems or networks.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.240]   And four, and this is kind of interesting, this comes from an actual case Microsoft had a
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.880]   problem with protect the rights or property of Microsoft.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.480]   They had a Microsoft employee who was leaking to the press.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.320]   And they went into his email and gotten a lot of trouble for doing that.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.360]   They said, no, we won't do it again.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.920]   We'll have some third party do it.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.520]   In fact, they say this, we will not inspect the customer's private content ourselves,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.360]   but we may refer them out of law enforcement.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   That's in regard to piracy.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.920]   So what's deceptive about just reading this paragraph is you're reading out of context.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.960]   They're referring to one drive.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.640]   They're not referring to your personal hard drive.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.960]   They're referring to network stuff.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.440]   And so I think that's completely standard for all types of drop box box.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.800]   If it's on the internet, they're and they have access to it.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.920]   They're required to give it the law enforcement period.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.120]   So in a way, this is up front of Microsoft is to point this out.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.600]   But at first when I read this at first and I even talked about it yesterday on the radio
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.320]   show, I'm kind of embarrassed because I said, oh my God, they can look at our hard drive.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.080]   No, there's no evidence that they can look at your personal files.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.920]   This is stuff that goes across the internet.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.080]   But you read a good point, Mark.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.120]   More stuff goes over the internet than maybe people realize.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.880]   And it's just that's the direction that everything is going.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.680]   I mean, even Apple, which is almost made like a marketing stance out of where respect
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:13.760]   your privacy and your data, even they are moving more toward sending more data to their
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.880]   cloud to sort of give you a better profile and give you better answers.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.080]   But the trade off is that it's going to the internet, which you're giving up some privacy
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   in that process.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.080]   Right.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.960]   I think the question is really if it's going to that company, if it's going online, if
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.160]   it's going to their cloud, I think really the question should be, what are they doing
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.600]   with it once instead of over there, right?
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.480]   If you want spotlight to search both the web and your computer locally, it's going to
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.320]   have to have to.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.320]   It has to.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.280]   And if you want Cortana to do the exact same thing, if you want Google now to do this,
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.760]   they have to know what those search terms are so they can reconcile whether that's something
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.400]   online on the web or that something locally on your laptop, on your phone, on your tablet,
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   whatever it is.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   Right.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.320]   So I don't really think it's the question of are they doing it or not is a bit of a moot
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.320]   point.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.120]   It's like, okay, they're doing it.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.160]   What are they doing with that data once they get it, right?
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.040]   And like you said, apples made that sense.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.160]   We're going to be, you know, privacy is going to be number one.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.960]   We're not going to exploit you.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.720]   The only way though, you can do that as Apple is by not having access to it in any way.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.800]   Because if you have access to it and you are presented with a legal subpoena or warrant,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.360]   you don't, you're doing business in the United States.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.480]   You have to give it to them.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.400]   You can't just, I mean, I know Twitter and others have said, well, but ultimately they
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   always have to give it.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.800]   Twitter has gone to court to protect certain people.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.800]   Often they lose.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.440]   You always lose because that's the law.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.840]   But wouldn't it be nice?
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840]   I mean, okay.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.040]   So with all the prison stuff, with all the NSA stuff, what we kind of found out is that
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.280]   almost every single one of these companies at some point was complying with the NSA in
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   some respect, right, whether we like it or not, whether they fought or not.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.680]   What would be nice is if they just tapped us on the shoulder and said, Hey, Nate, the
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.120]   NSA wants to look at some of your stuff.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.560]   There's a lot of them on the ballot.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.320]   It says specifically you can't tell anybody.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   Yeah, but you can't speak on it.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.200]   But these are laws that are made by our lawmakers.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.560]   These are laws that are made by our, you know, our lawmakers, not Apple or Google and Microsoft
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.640]   would go to lawmakers.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.520]   I think this is Microsoft properly saying, Hey, you should know they're doing what they
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.520]   need to do.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.520]   And I think they're doing as much as they can.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.720]   If law enforcement asks us, we have to turn it over.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   You should know that.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.160]   You don't want to get caught with something.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.080]   Don't put it on your device and don't put it on the cloud.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.040]   I don't understand how people just don't get this anymore.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.720]   Like when people get hacked for things over and over again, you hear about celebrities,
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.760]   all these things are news, even dumb people can see at some point someone getting hacked.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.920]   If there's something you care about, don't put it on a place that can get access to
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.440]   our mind and don't send it to a place restored on mine.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.600]   And if you want to change it from murders last week to puppy kitten.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.960]   So when it comes to a search filter, it doesn't get red flag or something.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.440]   Well, and if you want to preserve your privacy and you want to put stuff on the Internet,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.080]   there's only one way to do that, in my opinion, which is to encrypt it before it goes out
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.080]   of your machine.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.360]   Encryption is the solution, strong encryption.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.840]   A lot of that's in convenience.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.720]   I can't send Owen a message unless we've exchanged keys ahead of time.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.080]   Actually, it doesn't have to be ahead of time, but you have to have a mechanism for getting
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.440]   my key to read messages I send to you vice versa.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.840]   Phone call, a text message, it's complicated.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.360]   So people are super complicated.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   It's complicated.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   Privacy.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.240]   There are companies who are trying to do things like a bit torrent has an application called
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.360]   sync, which is peer to peer file sharing with encryption on both ends and in exchange
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.860]   of keys.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.800]   They're not actually ever seeing the files.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.080]   They just create the protocol so you can send stuff.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.480]   Although let's assume a friend the application.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.720]   It's never been open source and nobody knows how bit torrent sync works.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   This is true.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   You're trusting that bit torrent.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.200]   I do trust them, but I wish that open source or at least let somebody audit the code because
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.400]   they've never, Steve Gibson's asked many times, well, how does this work?
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.720]   And they've never revealed that.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   No, they haven't.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.960]   But there are things you can do to encrypt your data.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:07.600]   I probably wouldn't use Microsoft's BitLocker using open source encryption program, which
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.520]   true crypt are still around, but something like true crypt and you can protect yourself.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:19.440]   I think the other thing though is tech companies have to make a strong effort not to have this
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.960]   information to share with law enforcement.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.640]   So what does that mean?
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.080]   If they're providing services where we store our files and our information and we rely
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.720]   on them for both our personal lives and our work lives, what don't they store to give
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.280]   us better services so they can more quickly recognize what we're asking for and give it
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.480]   to us in a timely manner?
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   Incorrect.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.240]   They should encrypt the messages and then they should encrypt files and then.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:51.040]   But when they want to sort of be able to analyze our information in order to do the types of
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.360]   things that Google can do that everybody wants with Android and show ads.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.880]   But also sort of the some of the personalization stuff.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.880]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.760]   They need to be able to look through the contents of your email and your contacts.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.080]   It's worth it as far as I'm concerned.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.920]   Have at it Google because I love Google now.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.640]   It's worth it for them to take my stuff, but just understand anything I'm giving Google
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.760]   is available to anybody, including the government.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.200]   Just don't give them stuff I don't want them to have.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   Right.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   So you're right.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.400]   In order to give you these services, they have to do things.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.480]   I mean, in order to build the things that we're asking them to build now, we're still using
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.120]   for free, largely, even though we complain about the privacy issues.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.520]   I mean, it's a bit hypocritical for us to use this stuff and then be like, oh, I don't
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.840]   like the way that you aren't respecting my privacy and the way that you're not, you
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   complain with the government.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:43.200]   It's like we should be pressing lawmakers to be more transparent and to be more straightforward.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.000]   And then if you don't like the privacy compromises you're making, you shouldn't be using the
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.920]   things in the first place.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.600]   But it comes down a better consumer understanding.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.120]   I think a lot of times we give up more than we realize that we're giving away.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   Maybe that's why these articles are important.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   Go ahead.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.720]   On the flip side, Jared from Subway also did just get busted for doing some really
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.520]   scheming stuff on Craigslist.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   No wait a minute.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.240]   No, no, let's not.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.000]   I'm the poor guy.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Allegedly.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Allegedly.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Allegedly.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.080]   I'm allegedly on it.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.160]   But to the point when I'm just giving the other argument for what other people say, well,
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.040]   what about the criminals you're hiding in the internet and you're in Facebook and you're
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.120]   in your inbox?
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:28.280]   Like, you know, there are times where they do catch people doing things online, allegedly
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.800]   or not allegedly.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   So, you know, if we treat all these laws where no one can get information and there's bad
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.960]   people out there doing stuff, you know, like I said, I'll just give them a side of it.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   I'm not free.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   Privacy.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.120]   I'm just saying that when something bad happens and you catch somebody now it's all thank
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   you, Jeebus.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.120]   Right.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.200]   There's shady stuff going on in the world.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   So, right.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.360]   Well, it goes, it goes both ways, but like, like, like, kind of as you brought up, somebody
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.360]   saying, oh, and played the Jared card, which is difficult.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.760]   I mean, it just goes down to, to transparency.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.200]   If a cop wants to come into my apartment, they have to go and get a warrant.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.760]   And then when they knock on the door or knock down the door, they have to present that
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.760]   warrant.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   Yeah, do crushes.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760]   That's all we're asking for.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760]   Oh, I don't get to see the warrant.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.240]   But if I am, I do, right?
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.760]   They can still come into my apartment and rifle through my stuff, but I have that layer of
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.760]   protection.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.880]   And they went to a judge to get it and the exact judicial oversight.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.920]   We can have that for online too.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.880]   And to say that we can't, I think, is just, just a bit lazy and disingenuous.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.420]   I mean, we don't have that now.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:35.160]   And the people who are rifling through our stuff online don't want that extra layer to
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   be there.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.840]   So if we want that as consumers, I think we have to take a stance, right?
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.960]   We have to take some of our off-line worlds.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:49.080]   If we want some of these things online, I mean, you know, our lawmakers aren't going
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.080]   to be doing this for us.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.080]   It's going to have to come from us.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.080]   It's going to have to come from right to the same time.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.200]   subpoena where the cop shows up at my door and he shows up at Facebook's door like, look,
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.240]   we're about to rifle through your stuff.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.240]   Same time.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.800]   So everybody knows what's going on because I do understand that point.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   Extremely right.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   So okay.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   Knowing.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.960]   If I figure out that at the same time thing, we're just like, look, you want his information?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.840]   Call him or send somebody out there right now.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.840]   Let him know that we're about to do this and let's do it.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.120]   If they're going to knock down my door, they don't just tell my landlord.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   But if they're going through my stuff on Facebook, they just tell Facebook and not me.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.600]   That's not really cool to me.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.240]   Now, you know, but how do we change that?
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   How do we change that?
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.160]   If that's the status quo is because it's now, how do we change that is kind of what I'm
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160]   getting at.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.160]   Don't know.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.160]   But it's not lawmakers.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.160]   But I think we would have lawmakers anymore.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.160]   They haven't made any good laws.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160]   Wow.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   They're slacking on that.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   Slacking on that slacker is big time.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.040]   Taking all summer off.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.400]   Hey, if you want to, you can go into the settings on Windows 10 and disable a lot of
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.400]   these.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.880]   You got to look at the privacy settings.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.040]   It's kind of like Facebook.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040]   Same thing.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.160]   You know, page after page, but you can go in there.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.160]   Unfortunately, in the install process, they've got this nice button that says express settings.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.720]   Whatever you want, Microsoft, and I have to admit, every single time I just say, I don't
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.800]   want to go through all of those, but you can go back after the fact and look at them.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.080]   And if you really want, you can read the 12,000 word Yula and find out what it really, really
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   means.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.920]   Don't trust a lot of these blogs are giving you little excerpts that aren't really, maybe
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.240]   completely the full story.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.920]   We're going to take a break.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.080]   Got Owen J. J. Stone.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.800]   Oh, doctor with this.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   It's the finest setting.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   You got it.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   I'm on Facebook.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   That's pretty.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   I like that.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.800]   That's good.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   Beautiful.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.440]   You're on your way to Mars.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.840]   Somebody said this contrast messed up.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.840]   I'll turn it white.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   What is this?
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.840]   Is this a new website IQMZ?
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.840]   What is that?
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.560]   That's yeah, it's my website.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.960]   It's my longstanding website.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.760]   And I got a new project that I'm going to be launching on.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.360]   I'm working on high-end scenes.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.600]   It stands for acquiring minds media.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   Yes, sir.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.320]   This is 2002.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.720]   It's making itself over since 2002.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.120]   Yeah, I've been on the internet for a while.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.120]   We are told you.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.840]   That sounds bad.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.240]   You are.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.120]   Also with us from the Wall Street Journal, Nate Oliveris-Giles.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.120]   Is it Giles or Giles?
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.120]   Giles.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   Giles, sorry about that.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.120]   All good.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.440]   But he's full of guile.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:19.320]   And from Bloomberg Business Week, our friend Mark Millian, great to have all three of you.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.800]   Are you over 30 yet?
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.320]   No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.480]   He's a baby.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.520]   He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.120]   He started it like the only times when you're like a teenager, right?
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.000]   And I was at my first internship while I was in college for serious news.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Amazing.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Amazing.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.640]   He was old enough to drink, though, I think.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   Okay.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   Yes.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.640]   So you weren't a teenager.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   All right.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   Maybe not legally.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.440]   My son used to play this song and starts at team drinking.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.000]   You would know this, oh, doctor.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.760]   Team drinking is a very, very bad thing.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.120]   Yo, but I got a fake ID, though.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.520]   You ever hear that?
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.280]   I don't know what the song is.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.080]   But anyway, I don't know why I'd say you'd know it.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   It was rap.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.160]   You're a big rap fan, right?
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.320]   I've heard it before, yes.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   Yes, you might have heard that.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.560]   I can't remember who it is.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.120]   It's going to bother me now for the next half hour.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   You know what?
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.920]   The chat room will tell us within seconds.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   Hmm.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   Crowd sourcing.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.160]   Drinking is a very bad thing.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.560]   Yo, I got a fake ID, though.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.800]   I got a real education for my son, driving him to school and high school.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.480]   I learned all about rap.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.800]   He'd teach me old school, new school, Lil Wayne, all that stuff.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.560]   You need to go download, all right?
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.240]   If you've got to Apple Music, get a free.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Go listen to Little Dicky.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   He's a comedic rapper.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   Little Dicky.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.080]   He's a comedic rapper.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.360]   He just kickstarted his album and got fully funded, dropped his album on Friday, on a
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   Friday a weird day.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   But he's awesome.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.840]   He's like a comedian rapper.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.280]   It's really weird, funny stuff.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.840]   It's tipsy and J-Quan.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   Is that right?
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.840]   Yes, that is right.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   J-Quan.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.640]   He was a largely irrelevant St. Louis rapper.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   There's only irrelevant.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.640]   He worked on this with...
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.640]   So it was the best one to explain.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.960]   With rap genius, we worked with them to analyze hip hop music this week.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.960]   No kidding.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:10.880]   They helped us figure out who are some of the most popular apps in hip hop songs.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:17.720]   Twitter has like about 850 mentions recently in popular hip hop songs.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.720]   Well, that just shows you.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.600]   It's Big Graham's Big, Uber's Big.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.320]   Instagram's big and Instagram, you got to search the Graham because most...
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.960]   Every time I hear it and rap song, it's the Graham.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.960]   The Graham.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   The Graham.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.000]   That's what rappers use it as.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.280]   As Ellen said of Instagram, they say the Graham.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.280]   The Graham.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.120]   I mean, isn't that what you call it?
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.840]   I call it pretty much every day.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   Tinder.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   Snapchat.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.000]   You don't call Twitter and the tweets.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.080]   Huh.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.200]   I think Picardy did so well because it rhymed with party.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.520]   Instagram would be smart if they would rhyme with something.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   What's the Graham?
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.520]   Graham.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.520]   Graham.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.520]   I lost him.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.520]   Ham.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.520]   Scam.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.520]   Here's Beyonce.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.200]   Every girl in here get to look me up and down all on Instagram cake by the pound.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   That's good.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   I like that.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.840]   Here's Jay Z.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.560]   When I was talking Instagram, last thing you wanted was your picture snapped.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.560]   Kanye.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.560]   He Instagram is watch like hashtag madrichalert.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.480]   Did he say the words hashtag?
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   I think he does.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   Yes, he does.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.480]   Hashtag madrichalert.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.920]   That kind of has scans and scans.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.920]   You're happy.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.920]   ASAP Rocky.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.040]   Couple of Instagram likes.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.840]   Now she's famous.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.000]   J Cole Cole on Twitter.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Beep.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Beep.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.880]   Can't get a follow.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   Wow.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.040]   You should have your own show reading rap lyrics.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.080]   I should because I read it so I'm like with the other reading.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.120]   It sounds like I'm sitting next to Jay Z.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.240]   Beep me on my snip chat.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.640]   Beep me on my next tell chirp says childish Gambino.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.640]   Why would someone chirp?
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.520]   They birds.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.520]   Whale.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.520]   Whale says.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.520]   Wall a.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.520]   Wall a.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.520]   Spell whale.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.520]   It's wall a.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.520]   It's wall a.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.280]   I'm an old guy.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   Don't.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   Don't.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.280]   Hey.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.160]   Wall a's got an album out with Jerry Seinfeld.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   He's old.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   Oh, he's old school too.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.360]   I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.880]   What do you expect a little groupie to see my crib?
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.240]   It sounds cryptic to me.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.240]   It's cryptic.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   Well, you're reading it.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.680]   And that was from whale.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.480]   And now from whale.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   All right.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.680]   Oh, enough.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.920]   The hippie hoppy.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.240]   Hippie hop.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.840]   Hip hip hop to the just can't stop.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.520]   Our show today actually this is fun.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.520]   I'm excited about this.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520]   I showed it.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.680]   I brought to you by Whispersync for voice.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.760]   It's an innovation from Amazon and Audible.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   Amazon sells ebooks, right?
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.400]   You read on your Kindle, Audible sells audio books.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.280]   And I did this with the goldfinch and I loved it.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.400]   You can add narration to your Kindle ebooks.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.080]   So this was so cool.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.880]   I'm reading on my tablet.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:14.080]   I downloaded the goldfinch in text and I downloaded the audio on my paper white.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.320]   And as I'm reading, I'm listening and it's highlighting the words, by the way, great
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.720]   for early readers, for young people learning to read.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.600]   But it's also cool because you can switch where you left off.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.960]   So if you're in the car listening to the book and then you get home and you want to
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.440]   pick up your Kindle, you could pick up and read it on your Kindle.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.720]   It knows where you left off.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.920]   So you're always going to pick up right where you stopped reading.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.200]   It's a great way to enjoy those books.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.080]   You've been meaning to read, but you haven't had the time.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.080]   I like Kindle.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.480]   I like Audible together.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.680]   It's awesome.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.560]   You can learn how to add narration to your Kindle ebooks by visiting a special page we
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.120]   set up for you.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.880]   Amazon.com/Twit.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.200]   You can do it right on the Amazon.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.040]   You buy the Kindle book and you'll see add audio companion.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:02.200]   By the way, it's usually less expensive to buy both than it would be to buy each individually.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:07.000]   You switch between listening and reading on the Kindle app as well as on your Kindle
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.680]   tablet.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:15.520]   And there are now 60,000 Kindle bestsellers and popular titles with whisper sync audio
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.520]   built in.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.520]   I like doing this and I do it a lot now because I do sometimes like to read it and sometimes
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.000]   I like to listen.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:33.120]   For those who like to do both, whisper sync for voice, learn how to do it at Amazon.com/Twit.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.400]   And once I figured it out, I kind of started doing it more often with a lot of books.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.320]   It's a really great way to go.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   We're talking tech.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:46.280]   Mark Millian, Nathan Oliveris, Giles, Mr. Owen J.J. Wilson.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.120]   I think we, I think enough about Windows 10.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.320]   We kind of covered it, right?
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   Don't have to go obsessive about it.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.880]   Do you think people should upgrade now?
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.480]   Do you think they should wait?
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   It depends.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   If you're using Windows 8, upgrade today.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   Geez.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.480]   Right now.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480]   Do it yesterday.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.640]   If you're on Windows 7, I think you can wait a little while.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.880]   There's going to be some security bugs.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   We're going to be coming out.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.880]   There's going to be some patches.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.880]   The service pack, too, is coming later.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.080]   You don't have to feel urgency.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.080]   You've got a year.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.000]   If you want to do that free upgrade, you have a whole year.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.240]   And just to be clear, and if you listen to Windows Weekly, I think you know this already.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.120]   Paul Therott and Mary Jofoli have really explained the ins and outs.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.120]   Microsoft hasn't done a great job.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:31.240]   To be very clear, anybody using a legitimate authorized copy of Windows 7 or 8 can upgrade
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:37.840]   to the parallel version, you know, Windows Home to 10 Pro Home, Windows Pro to 10 Pro.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.840]   For free, you have a year.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.000]   That's amazing in itself.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   It's amazing.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   That's amazing in itself.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   I'm a meal.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.840]   I still got my old Windows disk with the 299-399 price tag.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.320]   I was like, wow, do I really like, and you had to spend it.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.560]   So I mean, for them, that's like a nice moment for them because people still ask, how much
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.560]   is the upgrade?
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.560]   I'm like, it's free.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   Nothing's free from Microsoft.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.560]   All right.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.560]   Well, look.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.800]   Is it amazing or is it just Microsoft, you know, capitulating to what is.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   It's a great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,

[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.800]   Let's take a break, we're having fun.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.800]   Owen J. J. Stone is here, and Nathan Oliver is Giles from the Wall Street Journal,
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.800]   and from Bloomberg Business Week, the great Mark Million, we are talking high-tech.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:38.800]   Did you miss anything this week on Twit? There were a few things that happened,
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.800]   let's just take a look so that you, you know, you feel like you're all caught up.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   Previously on Twit.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.800]   Taking an old timer, when did you get that sign?
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.800]   I got it on Amazon for four bucks.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.800]   Ah-ha-ha! Windows Weekly.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:52.800]   It's launch day.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.800]   Oh, you're gonna talk about Windows 10 again, are we?
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   Mary Jo had a review of Windows 10,
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.800]   titled "Goodbye Windows 8, Hello Windows 10", you are dickin' with it.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:06.800]   There's still things to start working the way they should, and for me, one of the big ones is OneDrive,
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.800]   but we kind of knew that was gonna be a mess.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.800]   [laughing]
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   The new screen sabers.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.800]   You call it FPV racing.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.800]   First person view, what does that mean?
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.800]   Well, this one actually has a camera that's in the front of the rig,
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:24.800]   so you actually pile it as if you were sitting in the aircraft itself.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.800]   Know how.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.800]   We have been doing a little experiment the last couple of weeks,
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.800]   trying to find out how much bacteria is on your cell phone,
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.800]   because we wanted to know if something like a phone,
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.800]   with its UV light, actually kill all the bacteria on your phone.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.800]   It works.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.800]   These are totally clear. There's nothing growing here.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.800]   That's pretty conclusive.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.800]   Twit.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   Technology isn't always pretty, but we are.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:50.800]   By and far the worst has to try castor.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.800]   They're crawling all over the zone.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:55.800]   [laughing]
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.800]   By the way, it's not new to X-Fault.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.800]   When the tricaster arrives, it's crystal clean, it's beautiful, it's pristine,
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.800]   but we have never, ever cleaned our tricaster.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.800]   Yeah, the tricaster is basically my plate for lunch or dinner, whatever I have to be eating.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.800]   If you get hungry, you're doing a show.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.800]   I just slop it on the tricaster and eat it.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.800]   Straight the cheese.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.800]   You got a burrito right there.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.800]   It kind of has its own seasoning.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:17.800]   That's too intense.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.800]   We're getting you some Clorox wipes, please.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.800]   I got my dash.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.800]   You know what?
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.800]   I'm going to get a dash for you.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.800]   Five bucks, you know the Amazon dash?
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.800]   Yeah, I got the buttons.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.800]   If you're a prime member, I got my button,
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.800]   and one of the buttons is for Clorox wipes.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.800]   I should just put that right there on the tricaster.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.800]   I'm pushing that button all the time.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.800]   Why would you do that?
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.800]   Because basically you're kind of kills immune system.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:43.800]   He's working every day because he can tolerate all the hands.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:44.800]   That's a good point.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.800]   Clean that board is going to make him sick.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.800]   Our technical directors never get sick.
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   Right.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.800]   Leo, come on, man.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.800]   They're immune.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.800]   I'm a doctor.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.800]   I got the dash.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.800]   It's a, it's a, it's a strangest thing.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:58.800]   I thought it was a neighbor fools joke.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.800]   Amazon talked about it at the end of March, right?
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.800]   Yep.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.800]   Right before April fools.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.800]   I thought, oh, this is a joke.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.800]   You push, it's push button ordering.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.800]   So I got the toilet paper one.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.800]   I figured that'd be a good thing to have right there in the John.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:11.800]   Next to the commode.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:12.800]   But you know, it's not an instant.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.800]   It's not, you know, it takes too long.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.800]   If you're waiting until that moment to press that button, you're doing it.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.800]   At least the idea is point, you know when you need it.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.800]   So you, you got, you push the button.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.800]   It, it, if you are a prime member and you've ordered that product before, it will repeat
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.800]   your order automatically.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:35.600]   If not, it'll send it to your app and then put it in the cart and then you can have to manually
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.800]   approve it.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.800]   It has debounce.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:42.320]   So if you've got a toddler that pushes it a hundred times, it still won't make multiple
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:43.320]   orders.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.800]   It only will let you repeat the order once the first order arrives.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.840]   So you're safe on that.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.320]   I think it's kind of cool.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.320]   I can't believe that I'm paying Amazon for the right to order more stuff from each of
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.320]   the buttons.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.320]   Five bucks.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.320]   Now here's the thing.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.320]   What is wrong with the world?
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.320]   Did you can't just use one click?
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.320]   You know what?
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.320]   Don't talk to me.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.320]   I'm just going to buy you.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.320]   It's bad in one click.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.320]   It's, it's, it's you.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:08.320]   That's why you got no toilet paper in your bathroom.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.320]   Because you buy one click and they're worried about the timer.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.320]   You need to click and run around with no toilet paper on your butt.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:17.320]   Yeah, you can even order toilet paper under water in the bathtub.
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:19.320]   Since you got the case that water was.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.320]   All day every day.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.320]   You can't stop it from shining.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.320]   But being too doesn't work under water by the way.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.320]   Well, they kind of hit on the disposable tech theme.
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.880]   These buttons are five dollars.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.320]   They have a Wi-Fi module in them.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.920]   They have a small battery.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.520]   What's going to happen with all of these buttons when they stop working?
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.520]   You're just going to throw them away.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.600]   Aren't I'm going to make a necklace out of them.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.600]   See?
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.600]   All stuff.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.600]   Stop buying all the toilet paper.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.600]   All the toilet paper necklace.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:43.600]   Oh, we live in a horrible, horrible society.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.600]   You're right.
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:45.600]   It's made me sad now.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.600]   Sorry.
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:47.600]   No, no more button.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.600]   You know what cheers me up?
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:49.600]   Squarespace.com.
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:52.600]   The place to make your next website.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.840]   It's so easy to use Squarespace.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.960]   It's so beautiful.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.480]   All the sites are mobile responsive.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.400]   We had a guy called the radio show.
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:06.400]   He had a T-shirt site and it was on, it was on Shopify and it wasn't mobile responsive.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:11.040]   I looked at it on a mobile phone and all of the good stuff was off the page and they
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:13.120]   said, "Dude, go to Squarespace.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.120]   They've got better e-commerce.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.120]   It's very affordable.
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.120]   Here's the deal.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:21.680]   You can try it right now for two weeks and just see how it works for you.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:22.680]   No charge.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.920]   You don't even give them a credit card number.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:24.920]   You just play with it.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:28.200]   Your website will look great on any size device.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.920]   Every website comes with a really nice e-commerce engine.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:36.120]   In fact, if you get the pro version, I guess they call it the business plan, you get all
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.560]   sorts of nice features.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.520]   You get ship station, makes it easy to ship stuff.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.720]   You get a calculator.
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.360]   It'll calculate taxes.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.360]   Really helps you.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.440]   It's a great system.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.440]   Very reliable too.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:51.280]   Squarespace is both the software and the hosting.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:55.400]   As little as $8 a month, you get a great website that will never go down.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.560]   You design it the way you want it to look.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.960]   Designs are beautiful.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:00.960]   They're powerful.
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.200]   They're robust.
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:09.320]   Right now, when you get a business or commerce system, a plan, they're offering $100 in AdWords

[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.640]   No credit card needed.

[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:38.160]   For the T-shirt guy, this is a great solution.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:42.320]   The main thing about all of this is you want the people who are using your site to be happy
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.520]   to have a great experience.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.680]   They will.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:45.680]   Squarespace.com.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:50.440]   Don't forget to use the Africa Twitch when you buy for 10% off.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:54.240]   We're talking the week's tech news.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.560]   You did mention Apple.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.560]   Let me see real quickly.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.200]   I think there's some Apple stories.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:04.280]   There was a rumor that the Apple TV will be coming out in the fall with the iPhone announcement.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:08.720]   I don't know if we should give these any credit at all.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:12.520]   But App Store on the Apple TV SDK series support.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.360]   Well, John, Pageakash, he's legit.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.360]   He's really good.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.360]   What to buzzfeed?
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.160]   That kind of took away some of this.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:19.160]   Some of his credibility.
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.160]   Some of his credibility.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:26.360]   The only thing about this, and I don't discount that Apple is planning to release the product
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.360]   in September.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.360]   But I feel like they've been trying to do that for like two years now.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.680]   I think that's what's going on.
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:35.720]   I think that's the issue is they haven't been able to make the deals, right?
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.200]   They probably have the hardware ready.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.600]   It feels like every time that there's an Apple announcement, we hear the rumors of, "Oh,
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.600]   this is going to be the one."
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:46.040]   I think a lot of legit journalists have said, "Okay, this is going to be the time when we
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.880]   see the new Apple TV."
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.480]   I think, well, John's a good reporter.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:56.280]   We can take this with a little bit of a grain of salt saying, "Okay, it could get delayed."
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.280]   Maybe the deals aren't going to be done.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280]   Right.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.320]   Not because John's source are bad, but because Apple has just not been able to deliver this
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:02.320]   product.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:10.640]   It seems like they really wanted to do it alongside the new subscription internet TV service with
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.640]   live TV.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:14.960]   If I was a media company, I would not be trusting Apple either.
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:16.800]   I think that's the problem.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:21.320]   Apple flipped the music in the share of Ron's head, and now they're getting flipped back
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.320]   over on their back.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.640]   Just the fact of when the iPad first came out, and how many companies lost out because they
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:32.320]   didn't have their own streaming app for their shows and things like that, and Apple's trying
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.320]   to sell episodes.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:35.920]   They're like, "Well, wait, we don't want to sell through them.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:36.920]   We want our own.
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:37.920]   Just come to me."
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:42.200]   They started actually figuring out the fact that we can't just give you this deal because
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:43.400]   we need to make our own money.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.120]   If we can make our own money using you without having to go through you, let's try that
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:48.120]   first.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:49.120]   Apple's like, "No, no, no, no.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.120]   Just give us a cut."
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.120]   Everybody makes money, baby.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.120]   It's just you and me, everybody.
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.880]   They're not falling for it this time.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.880]   Good luck with that, Apple.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.560]   The Apple TV, though, is really out of date.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.080]   I don't use it anymore.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.440]   I very rarely use it because it's just the interface is clunky.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.440]   It doesn't...
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:07.440]   What are you using, sir?
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.440]   Are you Roku now?
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.440]   Or Android TV?
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.080]   Android TV, the Nvidia Shield.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.600]   Frankly, I use my Xbox One as much as I use anything.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.120]   I love that Xbox.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.120]   I love my Xbox One.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.680]   That's a great media center.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:23.080]   It has all the apps, it has Netflix, Amazon, Hulu.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.880]   The only thing it doesn't have is the only thing the Apple has exclusively, which is
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:26.880]   iTunes.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:33.320]   I still like the largest media store online for music and movies.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.280]   But they're selling the same TV shows and movies as everybody else.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:41.280]   But it's also one place where it's safe, per se.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.280]   It's the same thing when people sell it.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.000]   It's something like, "Why should I buy something through Verizon?
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]   What if I move somewhere and it dries isn't there?"
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.760]   And I own all these movies on Verizon.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:50.760]   That's why I buy it from Amazon.
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:53.840]   Again, that's why people buy stuff through Apple.
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.240]   I got all Apple TVs in my house and I use it because...
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:59.600]   But Apple, you can only use in the Apple ecosystem and that's always going to be the
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.840]   case and that I find very limiting.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:07.280]   I feel like the reason I use Amazon is because I know I'll be able to buy it, to watch it
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:11.320]   on a variety of devices, not the Apple TV, but everything else.
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:15.360]   Just throwing this out there, Apple Music is going to come out for Android.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.160]   It's going to be one of the rare things that Apple's making for.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.160]   What's that going to be?
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:26.360]   The first app they're making for Android outside of the migrate your data from Android to Amazon.
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:32.720]   So, if they're showing a little bit of loosening there, if they make these deals to have a
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:37.800]   streaming TV service, why would we think that they wouldn't have that on Android at the
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:38.800]   very least?
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:42.680]   And technically, Apple Music is going to be on Windows too because of iTunes running on
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.040]   Windows 10, not Windows Phone.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.240]   But Windows 10.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:53.720]   So, I mean, to me, if they sign this deal up and they actually have a competent TV streaming
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:58.760]   service, something that will be an alternative to all of the apps from those networks like
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:04.400]   HBO Go or Netflix, Hulu, whatever, I think they're going to have it on Android at the
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.400]   very least.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.400]   I think they're going to have it somewhere else.
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.400]   Oh, that's very intriguing.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:08.400]   I don't know.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.400]   I mean, do you think I'm wrong?
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.400]   I would like to see that.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.400]   They're going to put it on that Toxic Health, too.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.400]   Really?
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:18.960]   I don't think they'll put it on Amazon Prime because Amazon locks down just as much stuff
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.960]   as Apple does.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:26.160]   But I just don't see Apple getting that deal, especially right now when you look at Xfinity
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:32.800]   Go or Comcast Go and they show you live TV, the HBO Go, all those things all encompassed
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:33.960]   in their channel.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.800]   That's why Apple is having such a problem.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.600]   You're like, "Look, bro, why are we going to give you this money when we're already
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.720]   running our own ship over here?
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.160]   We're not trying to parse meals with you and give you any more free food."
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:49.840]   I mean, it's happening in P. They're not quite there yet, but the cable industry is changing
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.840]   very fast.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:54.760]   Showtime has their over the top app now.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.680]   You can get without a cable subscription.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.520]   HBO now is available.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:04.560]   I think, really, once Disney takes ESPN in this territory, it's going to be like the flood
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.880]   gates are going to be open from there because Apple and Disney is waiting for us.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:08.880]   Very, very tight.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.880]   Very, very tight.
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:13.080]   I don't think Apple's trying to make a deal with Comcast.
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.760]   I don't think Apple's trying to make a deal with Time Warner.
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.240]   They're trying to make a deal with the networks directly.
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:18.240]   Right?
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.920]   Even the local stations.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.720]   And maybe even them.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:26.400]   Just like Mark said, it's about pulling apart what the cable bundle is.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.400]   So now-
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.400]   But you're the cable.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.400]   You assemble that.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.400]   The cable bundle.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.360]   You're scared because if you're in the bundle, you worry about Comcast getting pissed or falling
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.360]   apart.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.160]   You're making a big transition that you might not be ready to make.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:42.920]   And that's why I bring up the cable companies because they have a lot more equity and money
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.520]   in it to where they'll make the deal sweeter for those places not to go to Apple.
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:47.520]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.680]   There might be conflicts behind the scenes going on with that because they don't want
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:51.920]   to give up that market.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.640]   Not so much the individual channels, but if you're saying, "Look, if you just keep an
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:58.040]   exclusive deal with us, we can make this money.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.040]   Don't go to Apple.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.040]   Apple's going to take all your money."
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.040]   I don't know.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.440]   Apple just seems to have a problem getting it done.
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:03.440]   So we'll see what happens.
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.120]   Let's talk Black Hat and Def Con.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:08.200]   The big security conferences are in Vegas this weekend.
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.440]   We set a priest down there.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:12.160]   I'm hoping he can do something about it.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.040]   Father Robert Ballisarell, headlining our coverage, he goes every year.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:19.960]   He talked a little bit about it on the new screensavers yesterday.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:25.720]   What happens is the week before or the weeks before, a lot of security researchers reveal
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:31.040]   almost for publicity purposes, the stuff they're going to talk about at the conferences.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:37.640]   That's why you've seen now three, not one, not two, but three auto hacks.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:42.000]   This is the hack we saw in Wired of the UConnect in the Jeep.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]   Yeah, Jeep.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.160]   That was a big deal.
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.160]   Big deal.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.160]   Recalls.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:50.800]   Cost Jeep Chrysler a lot of money, 1.4 million cars.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:53.000]   They knew about it for months before that article came out too.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000]   That's a little frustrating.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000]   Which is the thing, right?
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.840]   I mean, come on guys.
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:02.280]   And I think they initially said it's not a huge problem we don't need to recall.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.280]   Yeah, they did.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:04.280]   And then they recall.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.560]   And then they said, "Well, it seems to be a bigger problem."
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.280]   Maybe just a publicity problem.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.080]   Maybe it isn't a huge problem.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.080]   I don't know.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.080]   That's the company standard.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.840]   Toyota had a lot of car companies do that.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.520]   Where they know the things wrong with the cars, they don't want to recall them until
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.520]   something really bad happens.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.720]   It's the universal standard.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.880]   Nobody fixes anything anymore unless they're humiliated in public.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:26.880]   Yes.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.520]   There might be that scene from Fight Club when he's on the plane.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:35.760]   He works, the character works for a car company, evaluating crashes and then figuring out
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:41.280]   whether paying the settlements will cost more than actually recalling all the vehicles.
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.560]   And that's someone's real job.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.560]   That's how things work.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.560]   That's genuine, yes.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.200]   But it's not just cars.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.200]   It's everybody.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:50.520]   I mean, Apple doesn't fix a flaw until somebody reveals it.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.280]   How about this stage fright?
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.720]   Now actually, the problem Google has is that they can't fix it at this point because there's
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.840]   so many phones out of their control stage fright.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:07.960]   And this is another one I'm sure we'll learn more about it at Black Hat or maybe Defcon.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:14.640]   Stage fright is a vulnerability in the media playback engine on almost all Android phones
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:21.880]   that means a carefully crafted MMS message could either at best crash the phone at worst
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:27.960]   allow a bad guy to take over your phone silently and without your knowledge.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:31.520]   Google has fixed, of course, internal code branches.
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.400]   They've got to fix on their own phones.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:36.280]   I'm sure they've pushed out a fix by now.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:40.680]   But they're reliant on the manufacturers and the carriers to fix all of those hundreds
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:42.400]   of millions of devices.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.560]   And you got to think there's a lot of devices that will never be fixed.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:53.280]   What's kind of fascinating to me is this really affects Android phones running jellybean
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.680]   and earlier.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:57.040]   So up to 2.2.
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:03.840]   Yeah, so if you have, I mean, this year's right now today your phone should be on a
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:04.840]   lollipop last year.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.320]   KitKat was the big release of Android.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:13.240]   But the problem with what Google has to put up with every single phone, it's like your
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:17.480]   Samsung Galaxy isn't going to get that new software update for nine months later.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.360]   And there's nothing Google can do about it.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.600]   Well, that's what drives me nuts.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.520]   It's not what Google can do about it.
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:27.000]   It's what Samsung, it's what Motorola, it's what they've done.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.440]   It's what HTC, it's what Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, all the carriers can do because they
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.480]   get Android from Google.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.600]   They want to skin it.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:39.480]   Then they go back and forth between each other, the hardware manufacturers and the carriers.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:41.160]   And then they add on their bloatware.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.760]   And then they have to, and so by the time it comes to you, and so it's like, I'm not
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:47.280]   even really mad at Google about this.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.400]   I'm mad at the carriers and the hardware manufacturers for skinning and bloatware and
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.000]   just taking so long to get the software updates to it.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.160]   One thing Google has done, and unfortunately it doesn't help you here, but they've done
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:05.800]   quite a bit of is moving stuff out of the system and into apps so that they can push
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:07.360]   updates to the Play Store.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:08.760]   They have control over that.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:09.760]   So that's helped a lot.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.200]   In fact, you'll see a lot of Android services now in the App Store.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.920]   And you'll get updated through the App Store.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:20.520]   That's why, because they know they're not going to get updates on Gingerbread phones
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:24.080]   sold by HTC in 2011.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.080]   It's just not going to happen.
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.760]   It's a smart move on their part.
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:32.760]   But be aware, and we'll learn more that proof of concept code has not been distributed,
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.760]   but I think it will be distributed this week.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:42.520]   At DefCon, there's a researcher who says he can hack GM's OnStar app, open the vehicle
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.000]   and start the engine.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.080]   Again, we'll get a demo this week.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.680]   Are people still using OnStar?
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:50.680]   It doesn't matter.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.880]   If it's in the car, they can take advantage of it.
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:53.880]   I guess you can disconnect it.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:59.120]   It wasn't the thing where you push a button and it calls the police.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.720]   Or you push a button and say, "Where the hell am I?"
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:02.720]   It does a lot of stuff.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.000]   I use the Hyundai BlueLink, which is the same version of it.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.680]   And it's actually kind of nice because it's useful.
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:11.680]   Like if you want to talk to a person somewhere.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:12.680]   Like having a butler.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.520]   If I get an accident, they call me.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:17.640]   They see if I want an ambulance to come out to me or they do all kinds of stuff with it.
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.240]   So yes, people still use it.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.080]   And so it's kind of like AAA.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.080]   It's kind of like that.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.920]   It's all the different years built in here.
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.720]   It's really, it's really, it's very popular.
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.120]   What if I got in the car accident?
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:32.560]   My phone slides in the back on the floor and I'm pinned to the wheel and I can't get out.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:35.560]   But the phone calls me on the Bluetooth and says, "Hey, do you need help?"
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:36.560]   And I say, "Yes."
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.000]   Like it's a useful thing.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000]   It's still very popular.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.920]   I mean, I'm paying 200 bucks a year for the service.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:44.080]   So it does a whole bunch of other stuff too.
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:45.840]   It gives me updates on my phone.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.560]   I mean, it tells me where my car is.
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.040]   I can geotag my car.
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:50.720]   I can limit the speed and the geofence.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.800]   If I go travel to LA and my buddies drive my car, I can say alert me if he drives me
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.320]   55 miles an hour or if he leaves Gloucester County or wherever.
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.600]   And it'll ping me and do all kinds of stuff.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.960]   So it comes to a whole bunch of features.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:02.960]   All right, I'm so...
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:07.320]   The hacker Sammy Kamkar said the problem is the mobile app.
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:10.360]   If you don't install the mobile app, you'll be all right because he hacks the mobile app
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:14.720]   and then is able to use that to hack on Star.
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:20.280]   But we'll get more details at Defcon to that and a whole lot more.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:25.600]   Because if there's one thing we've learned is as long as stuff has a chip in it, it'll
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.600]   be hacked eventually.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.920]   Not to say somebody.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:29.920]   Wow.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.520]   GM of course says it's preparing an update to the app that would address the vulnerability
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.840]   it's days away.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:44.080]   Again, don't do anything until you're humiliated in public then get going.
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.080]   Facebook results.
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:47.600]   Wow.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:53.400]   Facebook in quarter two, $4.04 billion in revenue.
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:56.360]   User growth only 3.47%.
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.360]   That's a little slower.
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:03.560]   But they are going to hit $1.49 billion monthly active.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:08.240]   You know, jeez, could they have just gotten that extra, what is it?
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.480]   $10,000 just to put them over to $1.5?
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.480]   Just what a minute.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.980]   Oh, it's $100.
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:13.980]   Is it a million?
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:14.980]   What is it?
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:15.980]   I don't even know anymore.
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:16.980]   Those numbers I can't calculate it.
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:17.980]   $810 million.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:18.980]   $10 million.
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:20.180]   Oh, well, that's harder.
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:21.340]   That's a lot of people.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:22.340]   That's a lot of people.
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:29.380]   Although they're about to turn on internet.org where somewhere soon that could put that $10
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:30.380]   million right there.
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.020]   Are you talking about what the drones over Africa?
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:35.380]   They got those drones, Africa, but where is it that they're?
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:36.380]   You're right.
[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:37.380]   They did a deal with the carrier somewhere.
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:38.380]   Yeah, South America.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:39.380]   Eastern Asia or maybe so.
[01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:40.380]   Oh, yeah, whatever.
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:41.380]   Soon.
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:44.020]   $1.49 billion people on Facebook every month.
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:48.540]   800 million people on WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook every month.
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.500]   700 million people on Messenger.
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:52.340]   300 million on Instagram.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:53.900]   That's not growing.
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:54.900]   It's not.
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:56.420]   And I think Twitter has about the same number of users.
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:57.660]   Twitter's finally caught up.
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:00.460]   1.5 billion searches daily.
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:04.860]   We're talking about that, but still not a competitor I think to Google on that.
[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:07.460]   But I would love to know what they mean by searches.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:09.300]   Is it like searching for your own name?
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.300]   Social grams.
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.300]   Is it searching?
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:15.700]   You're not going to Facebook to search for car dealers.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:16.980]   What's the best deal on a Hyundai?
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:18.220]   No, you're not going to do that.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:20.620]   Yeah, I think most of it is just searching your friend's names.
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:23.020]   That's how I use Facebook, at least.
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:25.860]   How many of my friends were caught wearing a dress in public?
[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:27.020]   That kind of thing.
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:29.020]   The market didn't like this quarter, though.
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.020]   Isn't that funny?
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:31.020]   There were some numbers.
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:32.020]   Look at Apple.
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:33.020]   Record quarter.
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:34.020]   Market punished them.
[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:35.580]   Apple was their forecast.
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:36.580]   Right.
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:37.940]   In this case, Facebook beat.
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:40.580]   So why did they punish them?
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:42.340]   The market didn't like the spending.
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:50.180]   There's spending a lot of money on some of these internet.org projects and on hiring.
[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:53.260]   They say a billion people now have access to the internet through internet.org.
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:55.460]   Not a billion people using it, but that's a billion people who have access.
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:56.460]   People offered access.
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:57.460]   Offed access.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:59.580]   That's great, though.
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:01.060]   There are some complaints about internet.org.
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:02.500]   It's really Facebook.
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:03.500]   Yeah.
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:04.500]   Yeah.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.860]   850 million people using groups on Facebook.
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:09.220]   I didn't even know if there was such a thing.
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:12.140]   450 million people using events on Facebook.
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:15.940]   40 million small business pages.
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:18.020]   Let's see if I can find the number on...
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:21.380]   I just want to know who's checking up on these numbers.
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:25.580]   Like, the other day, you know, so they have the sponsored ads now.
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:27.020]   So Walmart is one of the ads.
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:32.180]   They have 200,000 likes, but they only have 100,000 people following them.
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:34.180]   How did that happen?
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:35.180]   Right?
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:36.180]   Who are all these likes?
[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:38.500]   Wait, like, you know, and who's like a Walmart like that?
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:39.500]   You're like, "I don't even follow them to see."
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.500]   Okay.
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:41.500]   I got it.
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:44.500]   I think a lot of people just compulsively click the like button on everything they see on
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:45.500]   the screen.
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:46.500]   You'll learn not to do that quick enough.
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:50.020]   Well, and then there's also, as has been reported multiple times over the last few
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:53.940]   years, click farms, you know, a lot of people would have money on the chat.
[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:57.500]   So folks who aren't even real people clicking through and liking.
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:59.060]   But, yeah, you work for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:00.060]   You can sort of...
[01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:03.700]   I mean, these are legal disclosures quarterly to result.
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:04.700]   Disclosure.
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:06.180]   They can't lie, can they?
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:07.180]   They can't lie.
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:09.500]   But they can also not give you a complete picture.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:10.500]   Right.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:14.660]   So when they say there are 450 million people using Facebook groups, what does that mean?
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:15.660]   Right.
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:16.660]   They aren't saying how many is that per month?
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:17.660]   Is that per year?
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:18.900]   Is that total in the history?
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:19.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:20.900]   They left that part out, didn't they?
[01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:21.900]   Yeah.
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:24.420]   So they can't give false information, but they can give you not the entire story.
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:25.420]   Right.
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:27.260]   Which is what a lot of companies do, right?
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:28.260]   Yeah.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.260]   It could be manipulated.
[01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:32.780]   Twitter reported 316 million monthly active users.
[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:33.780]   That's pretty good.
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:35.780]   They had some decent growth.
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:39.340]   The stock went up because of that.
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:41.780]   Not that the stock market matters to me.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:46.380]   But then it went back down after Jack Dorsey started talking.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:52.980]   Apparently Jack Dorsey is going to be CEO because they just can't find anybody else.
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:53.980]   Even though he said...
[01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:57.900]   And the Twitter board has said, "You know, you got to have somebody's full-time CEO."
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:01.420]   Especially with Square on its way going public pretty soon.
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:05.140]   They filed confidentially to go public.
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:06.700]   I don't think Jack Dorsey wants to be CEO.
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:08.460]   I think a lot of people want him to be CEO.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:10.060]   Oh, you don't think he wants it?
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:11.060]   No.
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:14.340]   I think like Mark just pointed out, Square is about to go public.
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:18.900]   The board at Twitter just said, "We don't want to have a CEO who's part-time."
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:21.180]   I mean, and come on.
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:25.340]   I don't think that board didn't talk to Jack before making that announcement.
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:27.220]   I don't think that board is ever...
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:28.220]   No, that board is ever...
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:29.220]   And Dick.
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:30.660]   Yeah, it's all Jack's...
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:31.660]   It's his buddies.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:37.460]   I think if anything, that was something to telegraph to the wider world, "Hey, Jack's not going to be the guy."
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:42.100]   But instead, a lot of folks saw it as, "Oh, are they fighting amongst themselves?
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:43.580]   Is he going to quit Square?"
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:44.780]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:45.900]   Cara Swisher, who's running...
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:49.260]   I don't know why, but she seems to be running less and less at Recode.
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:54.460]   I feel like Cara and Walter are just kind of fading away in the distance now that Recode's owned by Verizon.
[01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:56.660]   Oh, that box.
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:58.860]   Well, it's not crunching some of my Verizon.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:50:59.860]   It's still Comcast.
[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:02.260]   They're all going to be owned by Comcast any minute now, right?
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:03.180]   Well, Comcast...
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.860]   Yeah, NBC Universal is coming out every day.
[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:06.500]   They owned them before.
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:08.940]   And they are investors in Vox and in Vox using.
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:11.780]   They bought them and they traded some stock.
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:14.420]   So really, they're still owned by this...
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:15.620]   Same people.
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:16.620]   Well, Vox.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:17.620]   Vox.
[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:22.580]   Anyway, Cara says Adam Bain is the inside choice.
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:24.500]   He is actually at Twitter right now.
[01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:25.500]   What is he?
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:26.500]   CFO?
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:27.500]   Twitter?
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:28.500]   They say he's very nice.
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:29.500]   That's it.
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.340]   That's all I have to report.
[01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:32.340]   And all I have to report.
[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:33.340]   Adam Bain.
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:34.340]   Oh, he's sales lead.
[01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:35.340]   That's right.
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:36.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:38.180]   Well, he certainly knows Twitter and how Twitter is making money.
[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:39.180]   And he's done very well.
[01:51:39.180 --> 01:51:40.180]   I mean, when he started...
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:42.500]   He's been there, what, five or six years.
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:43.860]   Twitter was hardly making any money.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:52.700]   I mean, their revenue growth has not been the thing that investors in Wall Street have
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:53.700]   had a problem with.
[01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:58.700]   It's been mostly the user growth, which has really stalled quite a bit in the last few
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:51:59.700]   quarters.
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:03.820]   And so you put a sales guy at the head of it, maybe he'll...
[01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:05.020]   Solving the wrong problem.
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:07.700]   Well, that's one way to look at it for sure.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:12.700]   I mean, that's also one of the arguments for Dorsey is that he invented the product
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:19.140]   and sort of has an eye for new features and leading the product.
[01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:24.180]   So maybe he can find a way to increase user growth so they can come anywhere close to
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:25.780]   Facebook.
[01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:32.420]   So recoats says that NBCUniversal is poised to make big investments in Voxed at BuzzFeed
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:33.540]   as well.
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:34.540]   So there you go.
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:35.540]   It's so confusing.
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:42.500]   I'm glad you're here to explain this all day because I don't know who owns whom anymore.
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.900]   Everybody's going to be owned by Comcast in the next five years.
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:45.900]   Right.
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:46.900]   So all the same thing.
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:47.900]   Same, same.
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:48.900]   Same thing.
[01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:49.900]   That's terrifying.
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:50.900]   Horrible story.
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:53.500]   Thank you, Boing Boing, for publishing this one.
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.020]   We've interviewed Karl Malamud.
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:56.020]   He's great.
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:57.020]   He's an activist.
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:00.260]   His goal is to make government transparent.
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:06.140]   Among other things, one of the things he does at his public.resource.org site is publish state
[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:07.380]   laws.
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:11.260]   Those are the laws, the people, the people's laws.
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:17.500]   Apparently the state of Georgia says those laws are copyrighted and they're suing Karl
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:26.020]   Malamud for publishing the Georgia code, the official code of Georgia, annotated.
[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:27.540]   They say this is copyright.
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:32.660]   These copyright protections are there to incentivize the state to create annotated copies of the
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:37.420]   law without the copyright Georgia's law would remain unannotated.
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:41.980]   And furthermore, this guy is equivalent to a terrorist.
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:47.100]   I love, I love ridiculous overreactions by crazy.
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:51.860]   Any government entity to anyone publishing anything, you know, journalism basically.
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:56.340]   If I were a citizen of the state of Georgia, I'd be just live it about this.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:57.620]   You don't own those laws.
[01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:59.300]   Those are the states.
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:02.540]   And we all have a right to read the penal code of our state.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:07.380]   I want to know who actually filed that lawsuit and what, but who's actually suing this guy
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:09.740]   because the state of Georgia.
[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:10.740]   Yeah.
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:14.220]   There's no way Georgia is going to win that.
[01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:16.300]   It's going to get this guy's name out there even more.
[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:19.460]   It's going to expose some ridiculousness in the state government.
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:24.620]   Maybe get a few people, you know, a little more politically and socially aware.
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:26.900]   It might have a positive effect of anything else.
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.180]   Carl's doing the right timing.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:31.340]   He's doing the work of the Lord.
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:32.700]   Keep doing the good work, Carl.
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:33.700]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:34.700]   I don't know.
[01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:35.900]   This is a great story for us.
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:39.820]   I don't know why he's doing it, but President Obama has issued an executive order that the
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:47.740]   United States must build the superist of supercomputers ever, then it's beginning Skynet.
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:53.860]   The National Strategic Computing Initiative will attempt to build the first ever exascale
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:59.300]   computer 30 times faster than today's fastest supercomputer.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:02.460]   Department of Energy, Department of Defense, National Science Foundation.
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:07.940]   It'll be primary for use by NASA, the FBI, and the National Institutes of Health, Department
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:13.660]   of Homeland Security, and the National Atmospheric and Something Administration.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:15.580]   What Noah's weather.
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:17.300]   Yup.
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:21.460]   Accelerating delivery of capable exascale computing system.
[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:23.900]   Oh, you know why we need to do this?
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:28.300]   Because as of June, China has the world's fastest supercomputer.
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.580]   33.86 petaflops.
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:32.580]   We need exaflops.
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:35.380]   Don't they have a really tall building too?
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:36.380]   Yeah.
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:40.260]   It's the new tallest building in the world competition.
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:45.220]   Just not right that they should have a faster computer.
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:46.860]   Are they doing anything special with it?
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:48.860]   Because China's still China.
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:50.860]   I don't know.
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:52.420]   I've been up and down China.
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:55.020]   There's a lot of places I had to wear masks you can't breathe.
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:00.420]   In copyright news, Happy Birthday may finally be free.
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:04.460]   Did you know, I think you do, that Warner Chappelle music owns the rights to the song
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:06.260]   Happy Birthday and every time.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:10.460]   This is why you watch a TV show and they'll sing things like, "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow."
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:14.400]   They don't want to pay thousands of dollars in royalty to Warner Chappelle for using Happy
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:15.640]   Birthday.
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:17.140]   I did not know that.
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:19.020]   Happy Birthday is a song.
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:20.020]   So take a look.
[01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:21.420]   You owe us some money.
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:24.060]   Every one of my birthday parties has been a cover?
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:25.860]   Like a karaoke in a sense.
[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:27.780]   I don't even know if I like that.
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:31.380]   Haven't you been to the restaurants where they're like, it's like Chi Chi's, they sing like a
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:32.380]   Mexican advert.
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:36.220]   It's like, that's why they always have their own Red Lobster Birthday.
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:37.220]   They'd have to pay money.
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:43.020]   So if I started singing Happy Birthday right now, that would cost you a degree.
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:46.620]   I could get a letter from Warner Chappelle saying, "You owe us."
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:47.620]   Stop it.
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:49.100]   I always sing it wrong.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:50.100]   Happy Birthday to you.
[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:53.980]   Do you think it's a good guy at Warner Chappelle who goes around.
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:55.900]   A guy, there's a whole building.
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:56.900]   How's that?
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:57.900]   How does he want...
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:00.580]   How does Mr. Stevie Wonder have to pack?
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:01.740]   He does have to pay.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:02.740]   He's a living God.
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:03.740]   Probably.
[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:06.340]   But he's saying that's like, "Happy Birthday."
[01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:07.940]   Yeah, but that's not the same song.
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:08.940]   It's a different song.
[01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:09.940]   Happy Birthday to you.
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:10.940]   Notice.
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:11.940]   Happy Birthday to you.
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:12.940]   That's the different word.
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:13.940]   That's the different word.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:14.940]   That's the different word.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:16.620]   There's a lawsuit going on.
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:19.180]   Good morning to you productions.
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:21.740]   File the Clash Action lawsuit two years ago.
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:28.140]   She was told she'd have to pay $1,500 to use the song in her Happy Birthday documentary.
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:30.420]   This is a lawsuit that's been going on for two years.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:34.020]   They found a smoking gun.
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:39.380]   It's kind of complicated, but they found a song book that had the words of music to
[01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:42.780]   Happy Birthday in it without a copyright mark.
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:44.460]   And those days, it's not true anymore.
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:46.100]   Your copyright automatically.
[01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:54.260]   But in those days, if you didn't have a copyright next to your stuff, it wouldn't be copyrighted.
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:58:00.260]   And so it may be that this whole thing is going to go up and smoke.
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:05.540]   Mr. Chappelle had the actual document, the song book.
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:07.740]   It was submitted in Discovery.
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:10.820]   The other side got it, but it was smudged.
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:12.620]   It's really a great story.
[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:17.780]   So watch carefully because soon it may be that we can finally free it last, free it
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:21.740]   last, sing Happy Birthday on this show.
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:23.020]   I can't wait.
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:24.020]   That'll be a Happy Day.
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:25.020]   When's your birthday?
[01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.020]   I'm excited.
[01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:27.020]   10/17.
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:28.020]   Come back in October.
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.940]   We can celebrate every day.
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:32.780]   Back in October and I will sing to you.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:33.780]   You do that.
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:35.220]   You should sing to me anyway.
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:36.220]   Cut the check.
[01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:37.220]   You got money, Uncle Leo.
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:38.220]   You love me.
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:42.180]   I ain't paying it to Warren and Chappelle for using a song that's 100 years old.
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:44.140]   The max is 1,500.
[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:45.140]   That's nothing to you.
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:46.820]   I don't ask for out of here.
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:47.820]   Anything special.
[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:49.500]   I'd love to be out.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:50.500]   All right.
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.060]   Let me make some money.
[01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:53.500]   Then I'll sing Happy Birthday to you.
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:54.500]   Are you?
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:56.820]   They brought to you by my mattress.
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:58.940]   I love my mattress.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:02.660]   You wouldn't think that you could buy a mattress on the internet, but you can.
[01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:04.580]   You may say, "Well, wait a minute.
[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:05.580]   I don't trust you, Leo.
[01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:09.900]   I got to lie on this mattress to know if it's comfortable because my needs are different
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:11.460]   than yours, Leo."
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:12.660]   That's true.
[01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:13.660]   That's true.
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:17.940]   Whoever said lying on a mattress in a showroom for five minutes is any way to buy a mattress.
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:18.940]   It's not.
[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:21.340]   Casper does you a little bit better.
[01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:23.300]   How about 100 days?
[01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:28.460]   You can buy a Casper mattress and you'll get free delivery and painless returns within
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:29.640]   100 days.
[01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:32.620]   You can sleep on this for 100 nights and decide on night, "99."
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:33.620]   You know what?
[01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:34.620]   It isn't the mattress for me.
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:35.660]   They'll come and they'll get it.
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:38.140]   They'll take it away and you'll pay nothing.
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:39.940]   I love my Casper.
[01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:41.500]   I think you're going to like it.
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:42.940]   It is latex and memory foam.
[01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:43.940]   Comes in a box.
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:44.940]   That's great.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:46.780]   I got it for my son too for this dorm room because they came in the box.
[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:49.300]   They could get it up to three flights easily.
[01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:52.580]   When you open it up, it's wrapped in Tyvek and they give you a little opener and you open
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:53.940]   it up because...
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:55.500]   And suddenly it's a full-size mattress.
[01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:56.500]   That's a queen-size mattress.
[01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:59.340]   They came in a box the size of a dorm refrigerator.
[01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:00.840]   Whoa!
[02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:02.700]   Now try that on your mattress at home.
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:05.940]   It is comfy, free delivery.
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:07.820]   It's made in the USA.
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:12.940]   They're revolutionizing the mattress industry by cutting the cost, selling direct to you.
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:17.780]   $500 for a twin, $950 for a king size for the best mattress you ever had.
[02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:19.700]   That's about a third what I paid for the mattress.
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:20.700]   I got rid of it.
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:22.100]   I didn't like all that much.
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:26.580]   And by the way, all you have to do is use the offer code TWIT and you'll save $50.
[02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:27.580]   That's even more affordable.
[02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:29.220]   Even Aussie loved it.
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:31.980]   Casper.com/Twit.
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:36.980]   Use the promo code TWIT and save big on your brand new mattress.
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.580]   No risk to you.
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:40.580]   Casper.
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:41.580]   We love my Casper.
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:42.580]   I love it.
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:44.820]   You don't have the no dogs on the bed rule.
[02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:46.900]   Oh, how could you do that?
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:48.620]   Do you not like Oron on the bed?
[02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:50.700]   Yeah, try not to.
[02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:52.700]   Oh, man, you're a harsh task.
[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:53.700]   I don't know.
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:54.700]   He's got a little stubby legs.
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.700]   He can't get on the bed.
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:58.420]   See, he can't get on the bed.
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:01.420]   You try that with a dog that can leap high enough to get on the bed.
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:02.420]   Then you tell me.
[02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:05.340]   Because while you spend your rest of your life going, no, get down.
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:06.940]   No, no, get down.
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:08.420]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:10.740]   After a while, if you train your dog, they just know better.
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:11.900]   My dog's 10.
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:13.980]   He knows not to jump into bed.
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:16.620]   He comes and curls up on his little mat on her floor.
[02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:18.780]   Don't you want to sleep with your doggy?
[02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:19.780]   Is this his oron?
[02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:21.860]   I don't need a furnace in the bed with me.
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:26.060]   Unless it's winter time and I'm in a post-apocalyptic world where I don't have heat or a blanket.
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:30.100]   No, it's a three dog night, my friend, and you need a puppy.
[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:32.140]   I'm surprised Casper doesn't have doggy mattresses.
[02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:34.900]   Yeah, I mean, they can they can show me like something like that.
[02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:36.860]   I'm calling a billion dollar idea.
[02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:52.780]   They could come in some of the size of like a graham cracker ball.
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:54.660]   Goron, is that I'm pronouncing it right?
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:55.660]   Goron, yeah.
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:56.660]   Goron.
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:57.660]   It's from the Legend of Zelda.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:02:01.660]   Goron is a bat dog.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:02.660]   What is he?
[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:03.660]   He's a bat pig.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:04.660]   French bulldog.
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:05.660]   It's a French bulldog.
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:06.660]   That's my next dog.
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:07.660]   I want one of those.
[02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:08.660]   That's my dog.
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:11.900]   He's my bat dog and he's adorable and he has his own Instagram feed.
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:13.460]   So that Goron SF.
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:14.460]   Yeah.
[02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:15.780]   He doesn't post as much as he used to.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:16.780]   He's slowing down.
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:17.780]   He is slowing down.
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:20.260]   He's like he's sleeping.
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:21.420]   He's using Google+ now.
[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:22.420]   Is he really?
[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:23.420]   Nah, nah.
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:24.420]   That's it.
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:25.420]   It's the end for Instagram.
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:26.420]   It's over.
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:29.220]   All right, two sad stories to wrap it up.
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:30.780]   Actually one happy one sad story.
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:33.420]   I'll start with the sad story.
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:36.580]   Maybe you heard about the hitchhiking robot.
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:38.980]   Oh my God.
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:39.980]   What?
[02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:41.780]   Yeah, I heard about it.
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:42.780]   I heard about it.
[02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:44.180]   Americans are terrible.
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:46.260]   So he hitchhiked all the way across Canada.
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:47.260]   No problem.
[02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:56.140]   This is a little robot hitchbot built by researchers from Ryerson and the University
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:58.820]   of Toronto.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.220]   And he's been going.
[02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:02.500]   So the deal is he can't move.
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:04.060]   But he could talk.
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:06.140]   So he sits by the road with his thumb out.
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:08.140]   Cars pull up and he says, "Hey, get me a ride."
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:13.900]   Actually, I think I have a video somewhere of the robot.
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:16.940]   And he hitchh'd all the way across Canada doing this.
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:20.540]   Was Canada the only country I thought he made it across another country too?
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:21.940]   He's been doing a lot of this.
[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:23.500]   Canada would be a good place to start.
[02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:25.020]   They're very nice.
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:27.660]   See, that's the problem.
[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:30.940]   Maybe that gave Goron the wrong idea.
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:31.940]   Goron.
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:32.940]   Sorry.
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:33.940]   Hitchbot.
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:35.380]   Do not let your dog hitch alone.
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:36.380]   Goron will love you.
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:37.380]   All right.
[02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:38.620]   Get into the car.
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:44.860]   Maybe that gave him the wrong idea because he had such success going across all of Canada.
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:45.860]   The Canadians picked him up.
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:46.860]   And Europe too.
[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:49.100]   He went across Europe too.
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:51.420]   He's not going to make it across the United States.
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:53.380]   He left just a week ago.
[02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:56.020]   Left and went through Boston.
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:57.580]   Much of New England.
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:03:59.580]   See, there he is going from Halifax to Victoria.
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:01.580]   No problem.
[02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:11.180]   But just last night, I'm sad to say, Hitchbot met his unfortunate demise in Philadelphia,
[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:15.420]   the city of brotherly love, but not robot love.
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:17.420]   He was torn asunder.
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:20.740]   Uncle Leo, let me tell you that picture.
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:21.740]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:22.740]   That is so sad.
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:23.740]   You don't know what this is.
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:24.740]   This is a patty wag.
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:27.420]   It's a cool thing that cops used to use instead of Billy Club.
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:28.420]   Yeah, they call it a cosh.
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:30.420]   He hit some man ahead with that.
[02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:31.420]   Yeah.
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:32.420]   I keep wanting to use in my office.
[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:33.420]   I got a bad downstairs.
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:34.420]   It looks like a flip-flop.
[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:35.420]   We call him chonclops.
[02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:36.420]   Yeah, it's a flip-flop with lead in it.
[02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:37.420]   It's a hard flip.
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:38.420]   It's going to lead in it.
[02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:39.420]   Oh, this thing, this is a knockout.
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:41.420]   But I'm just saying, you're worried about Skynnessy.
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:42.420]   I feel like we don't play that.
[02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:44.860]   We don't kill every single animal trying to robot.
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:46.740]   We don't know nothing about it in the street.
[02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:47.740]   I'm not worried about Skynnessy.
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:49.740]   I take it over and draw us on a cop stuff.
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:51.740]   You come out here to these hills.
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:56.740]   We do everything.
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:59.740]   I don't know him.
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:01.740]   I'm just saying, it's American's evil.
[02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:07.740]   It got started in Marblehead, got through Boston, got through New York City.
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:08.740]   I got through New York.
[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:10.740]   I'm surprised it got through New York.
[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:11.740]   Got to Philly.
[02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:12.740]   And that was through Philly.
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:14.740]   Couldn't make it through Philly.
[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:15.740]   Philadelphia.
[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:16.740]   It wouldn't have made it through Chicago either.
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:18.740]   It wouldn't have made it through Texas.
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:20.740]   There's like four spots in the United States where you should have a vote.
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:21.740]   You should have avoided.
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:24.740]   You should have came through Jersey if you wanted to live.
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:25.740]   You don't go through Philadelphia.
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:26.740]   You don't go through Chicago.
[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:28.740]   You don't go anywhere near Texas.
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:29.740]   Like, dangerous places.
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:30.740]   What's the fourth?
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:31.740]   What's the fourth?
[02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:32.740]   I want to know what the fourth is.
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:33.740]   LA?
[02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:34.740]   LA.
[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:35.740]   LA.
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:36.740]   Yeah.
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:37.740]   LA.
[02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:38.740]   You see the traffic in LA?
[02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:39.740]   Do you see the people in LA?
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:40.740]   Nobody cares about anything in LA.
[02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:42.740]   LA is a dangerous place to be in.
[02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:43.740]   If you read this, read his Twitter feed.
[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:45.740]   He had thousands of followers on Twitter.
[02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:46.740]   Oh dear.
[02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:48.740]   My body was damaged.
[02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:51.740]   But I live on with all my friends.
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:54.740]   Sometimes bad things happen to good robots.
[02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:58.740]   And finally, my trip must come to an end for now.
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:01.740]   But my love for humans will never fade.
[02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:02.740]   Thanks, friends.
[02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:03.740]   LA.
[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:05.740]   Can you do your rap lyrics in that voice?
[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:06.740]   LA.
[02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:08.740]   I want to hear the rap lyrics in that voice.
[02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:09.740]   LA.
[02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:12.740]   I like big bots and I cannot lie.
[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:15.740]   Those other brothers can deny.
[02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:18.740]   And a robot walks in.
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:19.740]   LA.
[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:20.740]   Oh my god.
[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:21.740]   LA.
[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:22.740]   LA.
[02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:23.740]   Anybody 10?
[02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:24.740]   I think yes.
[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:25.740]   Anybody 10?
[02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:26.740]   LA.
[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:27.740]   I go sprying.
[02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:28.740]   LA.
[02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:33.740]   I like robots and I cannot lie.
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:34.740]   Now here's the happy story.
[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:37.740]   Man shoots down drone hovering over house.
[02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:38.740]   LA.
[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:40.740]   This guy looks like a real psychopath.
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:41.740]   William Meredith.
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:42.740]   LA.
[02:06:42.740 --> 02:06:43.740]   Yes.
[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:44.740]   No, he doesn't.
[02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:45.740]   LA.
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:46.740]   Is this also in Philadelphia?
[02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:47.740]   LA.
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:49.740]   No, he'll view Kentucky.
[02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:52.740]   He neighborhood gunshots called the police.
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:56.740]   Meredith told the police a drone was hovering over his house where his teen daughter was
[02:06:56.740 --> 02:06:57.740]   sunbathing.
[02:06:57.740 --> 02:06:58.740]   LA.
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:02.740]   So he pulled out his gun and shot it.
[02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:03.740]   LA.
[02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:04.740]   Yeah, I think that's great.
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:05.740]   LA.
[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:06.740]   Yeah, he did.
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:07.740]   LA.
[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:11.740]   The drone's owner, the police say he was flying it to take pictures of somebody else's house.
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:13.740]   LA.
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:16.220]   Meredith said, well, I came out and it was down by the neighbor's house about 10 feet off
[02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:19.340]   the ground looking under their canopy that they've gotten under their backyard.
[02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:24.740]   I went and got my shotgun and I said to myself, I said, I'm not going to do anything.
[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:27.580]   It's directly over my property.
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:28.740]   And then it was.
[02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:29.740]   LA.
[02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:31.740]   Peeping Tom, digital expert.
[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:36.100]   He says shortly after a shooting, he received a visit from four men who said they owned the
[02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:39.740]   drone and said, it causes 1,800 bucks.
[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:40.740]   LA.
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:41.740]   LA.
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:43.940]   So they said he stood his ground.
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:49.620]   I had my 40 millimeter Glock on me and they started toward me and I told him if you cross
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:52.460]   my sidewalk, there's going to be another shooting.
[02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:53.460]   LA.
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:54.460]   OK, Bill Clinton.
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:55.460]   LA.
[02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:58.100]   I told him there's going to be another shooting.
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:07:59.100]   LA.
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:04.420]   If you come across that drone, I did not shoot that drone.
[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:05.420]   LA.
[02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:06.420]   LA.
[02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:09.580]   He's going to sue the drone's owners.
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:11.180]   He says, you know when you're on your, you know what?
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:12.340]   I think he's got absolutely right.
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:17.100]   If you got, if I had teenage daughter sunbathing in the back and some drone came, I'd be thrilled
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:18.420]   to shoot it.
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:20.340]   I want to get a bean bag cannon.
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:21.340]   So it's non-lethal.
[02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:22.340]   LA.
[02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:23.340]   LA.

[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:27.340]   LA.
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:30.140]   I was going to a blanket on it, trap it down and they showed up like, where's my, I don't
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:34.140]   know, when it bought me a remote online at DJI, I got me a new drone.
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:35.140]   LA.
[02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:38.540]   And I got a praise William Meredith because he knew enough, even though he had a Glock,
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:39.540]   you get the shotgun.
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:40.540]   LA.

[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:42.540]   LA.
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:43.540]   He's been, he's been skiing shooting before he lost his drill.
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:44.540]   You want a wide pattern.
[02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:47.860]   You don't want to narrow, you want a wide pattern.
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:48.860]   He's done this before.
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:49.860]   LA.
[02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:50.860]   LA.
[02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:51.860]   He looks like he has shotguns and fear.
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:52.860]   LA.
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:53.860]   I'm totally sympathetic.

[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:06.860]   LA.
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:07.860]   Man, I love China.
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:08.860]   I wish I would have gone down there, though.
[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:09.860]   Never.
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:10.860]   You have been there.
[02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:11.860]   I've not been China.
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:12.860]   Oh, man, let's all go to China.
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:13.860]   LA.
[02:10:13.860 --> 02:10:14.860]   I've been to China.

[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:22.860]   I skip all the local dates.
[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:23.860]   I'm going, uh, I'm global.
[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:24.860]   LA.
[02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:25.860]   China has great food.
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:26.860]   LA.
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:27.860]   It's not Chinese food, oddly enough.
[02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:28.860]   LA.
[02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:29.860]   And do you know what the best thing about China is?
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:30.860]   Like they don't take tips.
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:31.860]   You have to like force your money upon them.
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:33.300]   Like they do not accept your tips.
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:35.300]   They just want to price their food.
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:36.300]   Good for them.
[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:37.300]   I like that.
[02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:40.900]   Uh, and O and J.J. Stone, always a pleasure.
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:41.900]   Oh, doctor.
[02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.900]   Uh, his new site is his old site.
[02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:44.900]   Believe it or not.
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:45.900]   Yeah.

[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:51.700]   I bought an entire man.
[02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:54.300]   That is, that is some major commitment to movie making.
[02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:56.900]   That is, is that an official steady cam?
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:57.900]   LA.
[02:10:57.900 --> 02:10:58.900]   Yes.
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:10:59.900]   It's a new DJI Ronan.
[02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:00.900]   It's awesome.
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:01.900]   It is awesome.
[02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:03.100]   I don't know what I'm doing yet, but I just bought it.
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:04.100]   Well, that's the Ronan.
[02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:05.100]   Yeah.
[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:08.380]   Oh, DJI makes a really cool stuff.
[02:11:08.380 --> 02:11:10.900]   That's from the, yeah, they're the Phantom guys.
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:11.900]   Nice, nice.
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:15.060]   Nick going down to me for stuff though, because every time I buy something, I got to buy
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:16.460]   something extra, but it's worth it.
[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:19.900]   Because you know what, the pain in the butt and you do need it is, you, it's hard to balance
[02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:20.900]   that thing.
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:22.900]   You got to have the, the hanger so you can balance it.
[02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:25.540]   Now, now it's like, dude, it's super easy.
[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:26.540]   Really?
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:28.100]   If they fix things, it's so much better and so much faster.
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:29.100]   Because I'm doing all I'm doing.
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:30.100]   I get it balanced.
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:31.540]   So get one Uncle Leo.
