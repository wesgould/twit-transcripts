[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.700]   Colonial Pipeline paid the ransom, but where'd the money go?
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.380]   Are you ready for the Pixel 6? We'll find out Tuesday. The question is, is Google ready for the Pixel 6?
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.160]   And they found the president's secret Venmo.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.920]   I wonder if they used air tags. It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   It's time for Twit. This week in Tech. The show we cover the week's tech news
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   with a diverse panel of interesting people.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   This is the only show we do on the whole network where there's always somebody different on the show.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   And at first I thought, "Oh, all the shows should have a regular panel."
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   So maybe occasionally rotate people in and out.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   But I kind of look forward to this because I have a lot of people I want to talk to.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.920]   And so I always try to bring on, we always try to bring on, I get help from Jason Howell, who's producing the show.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   We always try to bring on a variety of people. And it's great to see each of you again.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   Haven't seen you in a while. Dan Patterson joins us from CBS News, CBSN.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   They're streaming live, streaming news product. Hi, Dan.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   Hey, it's always good to see you, Liam. It's always a pleasure to see you.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.920]   Do you did not get the memo that you don't have to wear a tie on this show?
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   I got that memo, but I chose to wear a tie. You look sharp. I like it.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   Bring in the hot weather. Was it for us or just in general? Yeah, why not?
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.920]   I mean, sometimes, very infrequently, a gentleman has to wear a tie.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   I agree. And you look like, I mean, an old-school broadcaster, which is great.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   I love that. You got the- Well, I certainly wear a microphone.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   Yeah, that's great. You look like a network guy.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   Boy, this your microphone. I know you use the Heil in studio, right?
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   That's your microphone's excellent, though. And I used to use many radio stations.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   It's a kind of a, you know, that and the RE20 from Lightroom Voice Earth.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   That's the SM- Is it 77? I can't remember the-
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.920]   720. 720. Okay. That's updated from the ones we used.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.920]   Looks good. And then arm, I must say, you have a lovely arm.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.920]   Do you want to say anything about your arm?
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   I invest heavily in my radio podcast.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.920]   That's a fancy ass arm is what I'm saying. It looks like a crane.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.920]   It's better that than having- I mean, you know those booms that just find out.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   I know they sag. They're awful. And then you hear the springs on them go boing.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   Right, right. Exactly. That's what I wanted to avoid.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.920]   Do you know how many years of my life I spent in radio studios with, like,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   faded wood console? Yeah. Yeah. You wanted a nice place.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.920]   That's good. When I'm radio, old-time radio guy like me or Dan
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   designs their own place. It's a very different experience I have to say.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.920]   I started in radio in the 90s, which didn't sound old at the time, but,
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.920]   Dan, I started with with carts and cutting tape.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   Exactly. Oh, if you've cut tape, you're an old-timer.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.920]   Yeah. You're an old-timer. Speaking of cutting tape, here he is, our UPS guy,
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   who is a direct from a live engagement making soap with his daughter.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.920]   Oh, and JJ, Ston, what do you- you just took your microphone off the- is that your arm?
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   I gotta put a new mic going out. I'm just over here with this bro.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   I got up. I got up. Back to my AKG 420. I got- oh, I'm sorry.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   I just ordered- I have high LPRs everywhere in the house and everything.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   But for some reason, the interface doesn't work with Linux.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   I'm using a sound device's interface. So I just ordered- because so many people,
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   including Scooter X in our chatroom, have recommended the Audio Technica ATR 2025 or whatever.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   I have one of those in the box. It's nice. I should sell it.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   I would have bought it from you. I'll send it to you.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   No, no, it's too late. I already bought one. It's coming in.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.920]   I got all road mics because I got the road-
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   Road's in the cast of a bro. Yeah.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.920]   So I went- oh, I went brand loyalty.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.920]   Let me give me a little sound check.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   Howdy. Let me see your Harry's sounds. I don't sound good at all.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   [laughter]
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   You sound real nice. How you doing? You sound fine.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   And joining us- Oh, look as good as Dapper Dan though.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.920]   No, no one does. Look at that. How short- it looks like he works at IBM.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   You know, you got to get a think plan. Yeah, that's- yeah.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.920]   That's right. Yeah.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.920]   Are they- is that short-sleeved? Do you have a pocket protector?
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.920]   No, I shouldn't.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.920]   Also with us. It's great to have him. Normally he's from Austin, Texas.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   He has relocated to Wisconsin. It's Wesley Faulkner.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   Everybody's favorite developer advocate. And this is Newie we were talking about earlier.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.920]   Neurodiversity advocate. Wesley and I were talking about how we can't focus very well.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   A-D-D.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   Hey.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   I think everybody in this business- I'm the slow man on the microphone pole.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   What do you got on your microphone pole?
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   This is a- I don't know. It's an- Oh, whoa. It's a friend of mine gave it to me.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   You got a no name. It sounds fine.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.920]   You all said it great. You're lighting is excellent.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   An excellent lighting. Thank you.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   Is that a real wood wall behind you or is that a green screen?
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   It's not wood. It is canvas. I'm not- actually- I have a new one that we can hang up.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.920]   So this is going to be the last time you're going to see this.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   No, it looks good. I like it. I feel like you're- Oh my God.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.920]   It's deformed.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   No, I feel like you're in kind of like a Cape Cod barn.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   Like the whaling ship is going to arrive any minute now and offload it's a cargo of spermissetti or something.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   I don't know.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   Yes. My new one is going to be warmer wood. It's still going to be wood.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   It's going to be horizontal instead of vertical.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.920]   Oh, fancy.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   It's nicer.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   It's bigger too.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   So I can sit a little bit- I can put a little bit further back so it's not so close to me.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   I also want to welcome our chatters and the IRC, but also in our Discord members of the club, club twit.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.920]   Get access, special access to our Discord server and we are on stage in the Discord server.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   So that means if you are in the audience- actually I'm going to promote myself.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   For some reason I'm in the audience.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   If you're in the audience, you can raise your hand and if you have got a comment or something you'd like to say about anything we're talking about,
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   we'll see if we can integrate that in. I want to do more of that because it's so fun to have those audio comments.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   A lot of times as we're talking I feel like we're not the only people who have opinions on these topics.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:36.920]   Speaking of which, topic number one, the colonial pipeline- oh and you had some great pictures.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   In fact, some people thought it was you of people in the southeast storing gasoline and plastic bags in their trunk.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   There was some severe hoarding going on in the southeast because of this ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   And that picture obviously is- I was 2009 in Mexico. So it came from somewhere.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:08.920]   Oh, it wasn't from- oh you're kidding. Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.920]   It wasn't from current events either. I literally Google gas and trunks for funds to find something because I knew somebody had done it.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   And I stumbled across that picture and then I'll see.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   Well, okay, truth and advertising. So we don't know what apparently that is not actually happening.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   Although we were talking about this on Wednesday and I think it was Jeff Jarvis who pointed out that really the panic was a media-inspired panic,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   much like the toilet paper panic of '20 because the pipeline itself wasn't down for very long.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.920]   It was down for a few days. And the ransomware attack actually hadn't hit the operations.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   The pipeline was closed in an excess of caution. The attack was on the IT department.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   However, who knows what the truth is because colonial pipeline also said they did not pay the ransom.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   But now according to Bloomberg, oh yes they did. $5 million in ransom shortly after like on Thursday, like the day after the attack, they rushed to pay the hackers.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   And we have the same sourcing on that as well. So even though they were very quiet as this was happening- and look, I can understand any business that's hit with a ransomware attack,
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   whether you're in small SMB or a huge critical infrastructure company like Colonial.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   You don't want to talk about this because it's embarrassing.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:34.920]   Yeah, and it's embarrassing. But I mean we had three sources. Bloomberg went up before CBS did, but they were telling the public one thing and in private doing the exact opposite.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:42.920]   Well, and here's an article from Elliptic which is a company that offers solutions for people who are hit by ransomware.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.920]   They trace the Bitcoin wall.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:54.920]   It said sometimes people think that Bitcoin is anonymous. And the owner of the account might not be associated with the account number, but the account number is on the blockchain.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   So you can see if, for instance, if I say, here's my Bitcoin wallet, give me money, people can see how much money went in that Bitcoin wallet.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   So we know that the dark side Bitcoin wallet has received 50, according to Elliptic, 57 payments from 21 different wallets since the early beginning of March.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   In the last couple of months, some of them, it looks like on Friday, 75 Bitcoin coming from the Colonial pipeline. What is 75 times 50,000?
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   I just want to clarify and just jump in here. The ransom did get paid, but it's a possibility that they did not pay the ransom.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   So both can be true.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.920]   Who else would have paid us if they had some sort of hacking insurance?
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.920]   Oh, they're insured.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.920]   Then they could say both. They can claim both.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.920]   Strictly speaking, it was true.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   Although one of the things we're seeing is as a outshoot of this and other recent ransomware attacks is increasingly insurance, you're saying we're not going to pay Bitcoin.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   We're not going to give anybody cryptocurrency for paying back ransom.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   Ransoms.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:12.920]   And regardless who actually made the payment.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.920]   Somebody made some money. These guys made a lot of money.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:33.920]   And it under it highlights that the challenge of ransomware, that every company, every government and even individuals face with ransomware, which is, and you saw the White House change their guidance at the press conference earlier this week with GenSec and others.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:47.920]   They initially, like everyone, our guidance is always don't pay the ransom, but they kind of subtly shifted that to, well, we always advise companies not to pay the ransom, but we do think that companies should do what's in their best interest.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   It's hard to say don't pay the ransom. I mean, it's easy to say it, but it's hard to do it because if you're sitting here and you're going to be out of business and it's going to cost you $100 million.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.920]   Right.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   15 million big deal.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   And often that ransom price. Now, I mean, there's all kinds of meta that went into this particular hack, but often the ransom price is set by these criminal organizations to be non factor in your decisions.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   So it might seem like a lot of money for you and I, five million bucks is a lot of money.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   But for a company at this scale, it really isn't a decision about like, well, is it cost effective to pay it or not just pay it and get it over with. Let's get back operational.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.920]   And I understand why the FBI would say don't pay it because they don't want to encourage these attacks, but that's not the calculus that any business is making. That's not their issue.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   Their issue is how do we get our stuff back online because we're going to lose millions every single day that we're offline.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   So I just getting back online. It is also some of this data gets exfiltrated from their servers. And if it got released on a open web, it could cause a lot of havoc.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.920]   So it's not getting up and running. It's making sure that it doesn't get out.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   Yeah. And that's what dark side specializes in.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:16.920]   They don't just exfiltrate their data. And there are a couple other groups that operate in a very similar way. They're kind of competing in a similar market, you know, maze, I think.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   Ragnarok or Ragnar. There are a couple of companies that will not just lock up your data, not just steal your data, but they'll kind of bludgeon you with these threats of like, well, we're going to leak some of your data.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   We're going to corrupt other components of your data. We're going to de-doss you and we're going to go after your client. So what do you want to do? Pay the ransom or like have a really bad day.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   Yeah. Well, that's what happened to Apple and their supplier, Quantum, when they got the hit by the R evil or revolve ransomware, the hackers. And this is what you do now.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   Your ransomware gang apparently is you get in. That's the first step. Before you trigger the ransomware, you survey the network. You exfiltrate anything of interest.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   You might also be looking for where the backups are stored and how to make sure those backups also get encrypted. Then once you feel like you've done the reconnaissance and you've gotten the data, then you trigger the ransomware.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:21.920]   And that's exactly what our evil did to Quanta. They said, oh, not only have we encrypted your data, but we've also got all the schematics for Apple's next products.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   And we're going to, here's a couple of them, 14 inch and 16 inch laptop. If you don't want us to release anymore, give us $50 million.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:37.920]   Now, I don't know what happened. I don't know if Quanta paid or Apple paid or if they caught the guys or what, but suddenly that stopped.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   So it sounds like they got paid and you're exactly right, Dan. It's worth a lot more than $50 million to Apple and probably to Quanta for that matter.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:16:03.920]   That that stuff's not leaked out. It's not just the encryption. There's also another problem. According to Bloomberg, even though Colonial Pipeline paid $15 million for the decryptor, it was so slow, they ended up restoring from backup anyway.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   Come on guys, if you're going to write ransomware, make sure it's efficient. At least the decryptor ought to be.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:17.920]   Isn't that why we have a ransomware gang in the first place? You have employees.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:24.920]   Darkside is an unusual operation. They had a website. They had an ethics policy.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:38.920]   Well, that's the interesting second half of this story. They claim that shortly after the president said, "We're going to get these guys."
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   They said, we should say, "The trustworthy folks over at the Darkside said they lost control of their servers and all the money in their Bitcoin or much of the money in their Bitcoin wallet."
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:17:06.920]   Darkside's blog posts. Yeah, they got a blog. Sure, they do. Why wouldn't they? Darkside's blog posts said, "A few hours ago, we lost access to the public part of our infrastructure, namely blog, payment server, CDN."
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:16.920]   Yes, they had a CDN, CDN servers. This is a Darksup speaking, the operator of the ransomware.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:24.920]   Now, these servers are unavailable via SSH and the hosting panels are blocked. Apparently, some cryptocurrency funds were withdrawn.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   Now, experts have said, "Well, it's possible," you know, SEAL Team Six found the servers and took them down.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   It's also possible that this apparently happens enough that there's a name for it, an exit strategy.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.920]   The Darkside guys thought, "Now would be a good time. I don't know. What do they do?"
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:54.920]   Now would be a good time to get out of the business and all by the way, instead of paying the affiliates, because Darkside is ransomware as a service, so they have other people who use their software.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:02.920]   Those people pay a percentage back to Darkside, actually goes the other way around. Darkside gets the money and then gives the people the money and keeps a little bit of it.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:12.920]   So instead of paying off the affiliates for this successful attack, they're just making off with the Bitcoin and pretending that they lost it all. What do you think?
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:22.920]   So they blame the government and flip the table and everybody runs out. And just in general, every American I know at least has heard the term, "We don't negotiate with terrorists, but we do."
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.920]   Oh, we better.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.920]   When you look overseas and somehow they got to go to the tundra's in the middle of the desert, I'm like, "Well, where did they come from?"
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:38.920]   So we do negotiate with terrorists. If somebody has something that you need and it's money and you've got the money to pay it, they pay that money.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.920]   And then they try to figure it out later. And I believe wholeheartedly in our war machine that is America.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   I don't even think Still Team 6 has a teleport machine. They can jump through space and die.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920]   It's hard.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:58.920]   And you can't, as what we seem to know is that these guys are Russian nationals, not Russian government, but they're Russians.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:06.920]   You can't just kind of invade Russia and take these guys out. I don't know. Dan, you're probably more an expert on dark ops than anybody else on this panel.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   Could we do that?
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:15.920]   I mean, there are two... The meta game here is way more interesting than the overt game.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   There is that adage that no one makes money in Russia without Vladimir Putin's say so.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   Right.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   And I'm instantly suspicious when I see an attack like this. I think everybody is like, you don't have to be an expert in cyber to say, did this come from Russia?
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   And even when we had intelligence that said this was probably Russian, the organized criminal actors in Russia are... they kind of play by that adage.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   You know, nobody's making money. There are no criminal organizations there that are acting in this way, attacking American critical infrastructure.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.920]   Even though it's run by a private company, this is critical infrastructure like the electricity or your water.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.920]   And nobody is attacking those things without Putin's say so.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   So on the flip side of that, Leo, like I don't know what the NSA or other cyber operations are doing, but I know that we've developed offensive capabilities and we haven't been shy about using some of those capabilities.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   And I do believe that Biden is more keyed in to cyber than his predecessor. So I would be shocked if there wasn't a proportional response.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.920]   But who knows what it is?
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   There was a tweet from a former director of a national intelligence who said, "Oh yeah, they're going in right now."
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   He said, "I don't know for sure, but based on my experience."
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.920]   It's funny though.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   There's some interesting points to this. One is that in their ethics statement, the dark side blog says we don't go after hospitals and national infrastructure.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:53.920]   There's some thinking that they didn't know that when they were attacking the IT of colonial pipeline, that they were actually attacking infrastructure.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:00.920]   You'd probably be prudent not to go after infrastructure. There are plenty of other excellent targets that you can make money on.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:14.920]   And you don't want to rile up a nation state. But assuming that this nation state is riled up and that dark side's security operations, their secops were good,
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.920]   is it reasonable to think that we would be able to? I think we could probably shut down their servers, right?
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.920]   Maybe we could invade their Bitcoin wall and maybe. I don't know.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.920]   If we can't stop the Pirate Bay, we can't stop these people.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:34.920]   I feel like they're objects. You don't have to have really good operational security to keep your stuff private.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:41.920]   Or do you? I don't know these days. You're right. We couldn't take down Pirate Bay.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.920]   But that was a long time ago, Wesley. We've got a bit.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.920]   And they were a determined adversary.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.920]   Well, God, I mean, dark side has to be a determined adversary.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   But the truth is they have dark side really a thing.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   I was just saying they don't have control because of their franchise model,
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   along with their PR marketing that they have a personal customer service.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.920]   They have customer service. They do. It's amazing.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   You can't stop dark side because it's almost like a flag that anyone could just sign up for.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.920]   It's like anonymous, right? You can't stop them.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   Yeah. But you could do what seems to have happened.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   We won't know if this was dark side exit strategy or if it was in fact something we did.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.920]   But I could see how it would be possible to disrupt their servers.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.920]   Somebody's serving that stuff. Especially a dark web server.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.920]   I mean, there's not the best reputation for stability with dark web servers.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   And it'd be possible. I mean, we were talking on the security now on Tuesday about Tor at any given point.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   As many as a third of Tor all Tor exit points are owned by national intelligence agencies.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:59.920]   So, you know, it'd be pretty hard against a determined nation state to keep everything a secret.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.920]   So I could see how, especially since it came the day after Biden, whether it was convenient for dark side to do it at that point,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:11.920]   or we really did get to him. I would love to know, frankly.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:18.920]   So the pipeline came back online. Again, it was never threatened, apparently, by the ransomware.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.920]   But it was closed just to be cautious. It came back online within a few days.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:29.920]   I don't know if there were big shortages, but there weren't any, no reason to put gasoline in a trunk and plastic bags.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.920]   Hey, again. I got it.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.920]   Oh, and you just continually prove how easily the American public is to troll.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.920]   Oh, that's really what we've proven, isn't it?
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.920]   Yeah, but there were people putting them in Lowe's containers.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.920]   I love this Florida Tesla that has...
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.920]   Why do you have gas? Oh, maybe he has a lawnmower or something.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   It might be a bike rack.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.920]   You just threw some gas containers.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   And this one you're saying is fake. That didn't really happen.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   And I sold out.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.920]   That looks so scary.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.920]   One hundred twenty-five bag.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   My favorite comment was, "How did you close a trunk?" I said with a lighter one hand and a cigar.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:19.920]   Is this one? You said you just googled this? So is this one from...
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   This was real. This was down like North Carolina or somewhere.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.920]   And then Lowe's paint bucket.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.920]   Another one's down south.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   That one's real.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   That's a famous one. I saw that all over Reddit.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.920]   I'm like, "What are we doing?"
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.920]   And who...
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.920]   They had to put a cap on.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   You can only get $30 from gas because people like this.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   I don't understand Americans.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   We need a better education system here.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   We are easily trolled.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.920]   And it's not even like, quote unquote, the media.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   I saw so many people on Facebook regionally that didn't...
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.920]   They don't watch the news.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.920]   But then other people jump in their comments and start telling them,
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   "You've got to get gas now."
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   And I'm like, "Well, that actually is an interesting point."
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.920]   Because social media is designed to spread rumors, panic rumors, right?
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.920]   Yes.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.920]   Yes. You get three people to put a line of people.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.920]   I was like, "Didn't they make it in the '70s without gas?
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.920]   We're going to be all right. It's going to be okay."
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.920]   And then my favorite thing is the president shut down.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.920]   I'm like, "You don't..."
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   That's why I know that it's not necessarily the media or the news
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.920]   because people don't even know why there's a gas shortage.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.920]   There's so many people just blaming the president
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.920]   and stopping us to have our own fuel in America.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.920]   I'm like, by the way, Owen, you're part of the solution.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   You're part of the problem.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   The AP actually did a fact check.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   Old photos fuel misinformation around gas shortages.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920]   That's great.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   You've been fact checked by the AP.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.920]   Hey, I got a fact checked by moms of America because I have 13 women.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   They're all women too.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   You can just tell their moms is checking in on me to make sure
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   that I'm not putting gas in my truck.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.920]   What do you think the misinformation propagated?
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.920]   Besides Owen, JJ Stone?
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   Oh, you think...
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   All right. That was a provocative question from Dan Patterson.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.920]   Do you think that perhaps a Russian coal farm or somebody like that
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   said, "Oh, quick, let's jump on these and use our butts to spread misinformation?"
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.920]   No, I'm not saying that.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   In fact, as we saw with the proliferation of groups like you and I,
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   definitely not always.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   You don't need to.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.920]   You don't actually need to.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.920]   The mechanics of social media are built in such a way.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   It's made to do this.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   Right.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.920]   Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter, YouTube.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   That's where misinformation and disinformation propagate.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   Sorry, I didn't mean to make a late hard time.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.920]   It's been there the whole time.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.920]   Everyone's doing the lulls.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   Everyone's just having fun.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.920]   Some people don't understand the difference between satire and reality.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   And they spread it with their own little spin on it and then go a little wild.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.920]   I think that when people see something, they're like, "Ooh, this is getting a lot of attention."
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   And with our new YouTube economy of grabbing attention and influencer marketing,
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.920]   people want to be...
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.920]   They want a little bit of that rush that they want the retweet, the like, the share.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   They want people to send whatever they're saying far and wide and get a little notoriety
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.920]   while they do it.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   It feels like in a microcosm, we have a personal perspective.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   In a microcosm, we have a perfect example of how that happens, innocently.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   Owen J. J. Stone puts on Instagram a picture from Mexico from some years ago, making a
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   joke, which anybody, including me who saw it, would go, "Yeah, thank you.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   Good one, Owen."
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   But some people didn't retweeted it, reposted it.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   It gets more and more serious.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   Facebook and Twitter and Instagram are designed algorithmically to promote this stuff, to build
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.920]   it up.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:57.920]   You can see this happen in a microcosm in real time and you can see how, in a way, we've
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   created the perfect mechanism for spinning up fear and panic and upset in this country.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   What do we do now?
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.920]   What do we do about it?
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   I'm under attack.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   I was part of the laws.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   You were the lone gang.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.920]   You got misunderstood.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   It started innocently.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.920]   Yes, and it really is very quick.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   When people start reaching out to me, I'm really thinking about it.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   You think that I would do that?
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   I was shocked by how many people were thinking that.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   I was like, "Okay, but that's what happens."
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   Somebody puts up something and everyone gets mad about certain memes.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.600]   There's always some kind of stereotype or a meme that'll get you where you're like,
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.480]   "That is blatantly false.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.480]   What are you doing?"
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.840]   And then the other person's like, "I just thought it was funny.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.320]   I didn't take it as seriously as you're taking it.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   I just thought it was funny."
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.880]   I'm not saying you through a match on a lit, enough.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.880]   No, no, no.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.440]   I'm just saying in general, that's what happens though.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.040]   I'm not saying you're talking.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:09.880]   The real problem is these mechanisms, which are dumb, not people, the mechanisms themselves
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.160]   are just computer algorithms and they're really designed.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.760]   It's good for business to do this.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.400]   Now we've got a problem.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   What do we do about it?
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   Fear or fun.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.360]   I don't even know how you stop it.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.440]   Because again, when I do it, to what you said, you're exactly right.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.960]   I do it because I'm like, "This is funny.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.640]   I know people are going to laugh at this.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.640]   It's funny."
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.200]   I personally never take an account unless I think it's something that's violent or something
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   like that.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   I never take an account.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   It's my misunderstanding.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.600]   I just say it's funny and I go post it.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.760]   But if I was a rational person, like all of us could be, I would think, "Oh, misinformation.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.200]   I shouldn't do it."
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   But then where's the fun?
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.000]   It's by the way why I don't have a Facebook Twitter.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   I'm not on Facebook.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   I'm not on Twitter, but I don't use it.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   I'm on Instagram.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.480]   I don't use it just so I can show it.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.400]   But that's why I don't use these platforms.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:04.160]   They really do lend themselves to misunderstanding and upset.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   I've done it myself.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.200]   I've seen people getting so much trouble on Twitter, not innocently, but you get a little
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.800]   spun up and you do a tweet that you didn't really think through.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.200]   Now you're in a flame war.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:25.720]   We all know the concept of priming and advertising, where you're given a message repeatedly and
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.120]   you act on that message.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.640]   Facebook and Twitter and especially.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.400]   I really didn't mean to take a funny conversation and make it seriously.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.720]   No, I'm making it serious.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   I take a funny...
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.720]   Oh, an experience.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:43.560]   He was doing something that was funny and we should all be able to have a good senseability
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.120]   or a humorous senseability where we laugh at stuff and ignore things like this.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:54.200]   But what you're describing, Leo, is the Tinder that is built up and everything on social
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.880]   because engagement is the key to monetization.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.000]   It's all Tinder all the time.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.200]   I think it's a bad trend, but I see it and we do it, but we blame the people.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.440]   Like all people want to know better.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.760]   They need a better education.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.200]   They need to be taught how to distinguish good content from bad content.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.920]   But it isn't people's fault because this stuff has always gone on.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.380]   Somebody's mentioning the original troll was War of the World by Orson Welles, which
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.420]   terrified people across America.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:30.780]   By the way, that was used as an example of why radio is way too dangerous a medium because
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.340]   it was very convincing.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:38.940]   We've just weaponized these tools in such a way that you can't make a joke anymore.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.940]   I don't blame people.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.460]   I don't think it's our fault.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:47.300]   I think we've got to do something about the medium.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:54.540]   Well, in software development, there's this thing called the tour or the out of box experience
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:32:01.020]   or the walkthrough where you can walk the user onto the medium the way that you want
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.260]   them to flow.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:08.380]   If there was a gating option to show, "Hey, this is how you can spot misinformation when
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.300]   you're on Twitter, when you launch Twitter, and you can walk you through, "Hey, you see
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:17.740]   this picture of this person filling up their tank or all these containers of gas?"
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.460]   Keep in mind, this is extremely cropped.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.820]   If you pulled out, then you might not see.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.100]   So everyone doing it.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.020]   So this could be an isolating incident.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.260]   You don't know.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:31.860]   So don't think that this is way bigger because you're seeing just this one image.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.860]   They could do that.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:37.140]   I remember Google early on that used to do a health check like, "Hey, would you like
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:42.900]   200 megs of free Google Drive storage by going through and checking to make sure your
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.060]   password and your password hygiene was good?"
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.020]   They could do the same thing with these services.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.900]   I think lower in the rundown, we're going to be talking about a Twitter-
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.180]   Twitter subscription service.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:59.300]   What if they made that part of it saying, "Hey, with great power comes great responsibility
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.300]   for making sure you're a great user."
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.300]   I think the reason is not happening.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.260]   There's no motivation for that.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:10.100]   But they should really do this to get ahead of this legislation because Congress doesn't
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.100]   like them right now.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.180]   That's the incentive.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:20.380]   And stuff like that could help head off those problems with legislating that these companies
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.980]   make sure their users use their product responsibly.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.660]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.940]   That's the argument for investigation and legislation is that's the stick with which
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.100]   you get these companies to do the right thing because there's no incentive otherwise.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.900]   They make money when people are upset.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.580]   They make money when the fire gets lit.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.780]   That's good for Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and everybody else.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.660]   I don't want to single anybody out.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.980]   Dan, does that seem reasonable?
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.700]   Is that a good solution?
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.340]   I like that quite a bit.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:57.460]   I think that what Wesley describes is exactly, I mean, that would encounter or it would encourage
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.900]   behavior that is counter to the business models of a lot of these companies.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.540]   But it sounds like a fantastic suggestion.
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.540]   You got to do something.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:12.140]   I spoke with Christopher Wiley, who was the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.700]   And he made this great metaphor for what's happening right now.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.780]   And he used a building.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.540]   Well, you know, we're in New York City and he says, look, you know, you can't build apartments
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.860]   past a certain height.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.500]   You can't build buildings past a certain height without having a building inspector.
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.820]   And if you want to go up and down in those buildings, you definitely need an elevator.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:36.420]   Well, are you going to get into an elevator that has not been tested?
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.220]   No, of course you're not.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.260]   That's no, you're definitely not going to do that.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.660]   So that's the same thing in his words that we should do with social media firms.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:51.020]   Instead of regulating what speeches or having this dumb debate about what speeches, which
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:57.580]   is really just designed to distract us, instead just build for safety and design protocols
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:02.260]   inside social networks that do exactly like Wesley is describing, which is safety.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.020]   We're not talking about speech.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.900]   We're talking about safety.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:13.060]   And we can see the inherent unsafety or the problem, the flaws and the danger when we look
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.380]   at groups like QAnon, or we look at people like Maria Ressa in the Philippines who has
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:23.180]   a constitution much like the United States Constitution, but it was overtaken by a strong
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:29.060]   man, Duterte, who used Facebook to weaponize disinformation and attack her, a journalist
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.180]   telling the truth about a politician.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:37.060]   And if we're not careful, we're going to see a very similar weaponization of social media
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.060]   here in the United States.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:45.860]   And we saw glimmers of that with QAnon, which was a remarkably violent movement.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.100]   She's still in prison or did she was in prison?
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.100]   She's not in prison.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.100]   Okay.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.980]   I mean, the hammer could come down at any time.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   She was accused of libeling.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.420]   Yeah, but it's all made up.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:04.220]   I mean, it's all made up and the accusations have come from Facebook and from Twitter.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:11.180]   And Brigades, very similar to what we saw with like Stop the Steel and QAnon on Facebook,
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:16.980]   where they just proliferated so rapidly that you could send a small message and that signal
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.860]   would amp up this entire crowd who would go on the attack.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:25.380]   Anyone who's covered QAnon knows the death threats are real from QAnon.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.740]   And the same phenomenon happened to Maria Ressa.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:33.220]   And I mean, a country with a constitution like the United States, when a journalist is targeted
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:39.700]   with violence by the president and by mobs who are whipped up on Facebook, bad things
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.700]   are going to happen.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.020]   All right, that sounded way more moralistic than I know.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.660]   I think it's good.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:50.100]   We go back and forth all the time on all of our shows about government regulation.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.740]   And there's different points of view on this.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.780]   There's some people who say, you know, technology's brought us so many gifts.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:02.460]   We should be very slow to try to regulate these companies all the way to people saying,
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.180]   you know, you're going to break them all up or put them all out of business because they're
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.660]   a blight on the humanity.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:13.060]   And I go back and forth, you know, the history of government regulation of technology is
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.780]   not good.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:21.340]   But at the same time, you're never going to get Mark Zuckerberg to give up the algorithm
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.980]   and give up the traffic and the attention he gets.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.220]   So you're going to have to give him a stick.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.980]   There has to be something that threatens them so that forces them to do the right thing,
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:31.980]   I think.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.980]   It has to be a more of a business cost.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.220]   It's the same thing as choosing the right amount for your ransomware demands.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:42.820]   There has to be a greater business cost than the money he's making.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.740]   Otherwise, he's just going to thumb his nose at it.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:45.740]   And that's so far.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:50.260]   That's exactly even when he gets, you know, you see fines in the EU, recoveries like
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.700]   Apple for $15 million.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:56.060]   And it's like, okay, here, fine.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.060]   That's not a threat.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.060]   You need to make it.
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.060]   You need to make it serious.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.860]   Do you disagree, Owen?
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.380]   I don't think you're a fan of government regulation.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:08.620]   I'm just saying, for those listening to the can't see me, I'm an overweight individual.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.980]   There's a lot of things attributed to that.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:13.540]   I would be lazy, but a lot of it has to be with when I look at the ingredients about
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.540]   stuff that says, aspirate the diocese of Roboflobolobolobolob.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:21.340]   Okay, so the government doesn't really eat that Roboflobolobolob.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.420]   That stuff will make you sick.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.980]   Certain things do though, right?
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.980]   Yep.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:27.980]   Cancer rates are higher.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.100]   Everybody's spraying their face with all kinds of stuff, putting chemicals on their bodies
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.100]   every day.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.140]   And the government allows us to do it and they allow companies to get away with shortcuts
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.740]   to do it so they can make money.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.740]   And once they find out there's something's wrong with it, they go pay a little claim
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.460]   or a little fee or a fine.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:45.420]   And then the people that suffered through it get like $40 or something on a class action
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.420]   suit.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.420]   Okay.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.420]   We've ruined water in this country.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.260]   We're trying to privatize it, electricity, like all kinds of things that are just bigger
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.020]   than the internet that the government hasn't seemed to fix yet.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:59.980]   So I don't know if I'm really relying on the fix or threaten the internet to fix the things
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.460]   that we have going on online.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.460]   You know what really works?
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:08.580]   The warning on the bag that say may cause diarrhea or loose stool.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.140]   For Olestra, this Fax substitute that everybody was saying, oh, this is going to be great.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.140]   It's going to save America's population.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.660]   They put it in Lay's potato chips and it caused intestinal disruption.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.020]   The FDA approved it.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.020]   They allowed it.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.860]   What killed Olestra was the warning on the bag.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.780]   Everything that goes on to tell the after 11 o'clock, that's a medical solution.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.780]   Look at the warnings.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.660]   It ends with a 30 second.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.340]   My call is bleeding in Tersonal.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.980]   I just don't forget about your mother's birthday four years.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.820]   Like the things that they list off at the end is like, well, what problem was it even
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.820]   fixing in the first place?
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.980]   Because you just gave me 44 problems for taking this.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.980]   And guess what?
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.100]   It's FDA approved free and clear.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.580]   Let's go get it in American.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:57.940]   So again, I hear what you're saying about Zuckerberg's and the way the world works.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.580]   But I mean, like the government doesn't do such a great job.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.980]   I mean, like lobbyists one hand washes another.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.980]   We do what we got to do to make money.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.980]   This is America.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:12.220]   If they put a sign on Facebook that said make cause anal leakage, I think I think it would
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.220]   help.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.900]   That's just all I'm saying.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.900]   You don't have to outlaw Facebook.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.780]   You don't even take a law.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.780]   I can't I can't go against that.
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.980]   I got nothing.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.300]   And it would be true.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.140]   It would be true.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.140]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.980]   A lot of people who spout the stuff on Facebook, it would be inaccurate.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.980]   Something's leaking.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.980]   I don't know.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.980]   All right.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.660]   Let's we're going to change the subject.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.900]   Not not one minute too soon.
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.860]   It's really great to have you guys.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.820]   Wesley Faulkner always a pleasure.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:48.260]   Thank you for being here.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:52.020]   Wesley actually I want to give Dr. Mama a chance to get up on the stage and talk about anal
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.020]   leakage.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.700]   But Wesley is a developer advocate and neurodiversity advocate.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.300]   Wesley 88 on the Twitter.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.740]   I also want to say thank you.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.740]   Thank you for being here.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.660]   I also want to thank Owen J. J. Stone, IQMZ.com.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:08.100]   We're going to find out why he wants to give out his phone number because he's doing it
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.100]   right now.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.100]   I don't understand.
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.100]   We'll find that out.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.100]   I'll be already texting.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.100]   Just tell me your name.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   I'll get back to after the show because I'm busy right now.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.100]   He's doing something.
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.620]   But we'll find out what that number is and why he wants you to use it in just a moment.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:26.060]   Also the great Dan Patterson from CBS News and actual senior producer at CBS News.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.700]   That's just a reporter.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.060]   What do they call it?
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.860]   That Laura Thurds is senior.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.340]   Well, take the senior out.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.340]   He's no longer senior.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.900]   He used to call it the Tiffany network.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.900]   Didn't they?
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.900]   Wasn't that it?
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.900]   The Tiffany network.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.900]   CBS News Matters.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.380]   Where News Matters.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.500]   Dr. Mom is in the Discord.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.340]   She apparently knows something about anal leakage.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.340]   Jolestra.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.020]   Dr. Mom, what is up?
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:57.660]   Well, what you have to remember with all these things is the FDA makes them put in ridiculous
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.060]   warnings that this may cause death.
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:04.860]   This may, my favorite is if you've ever had a family member who's died from this or you
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.580]   might have died from this, don't use it.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.300]   It may cause death.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.340]   But you see, but you know, Owen's point, Dr. Mom, and you're a physician, we should
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.340]   say she's an MD.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:22.540]   She's a physician, is that you see, you still see all these ads on TV all the time.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.940]   For drugs, you can't even, you have to go to your physician.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:30.220]   I guess that they say ask your doctor if you might, if, if the Tarvey might be right
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.540]   for you.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.420]   And then they have a page and a half.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.900]   They go on and on and on.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:39.060]   While they're showing smiling, by the way, they always do this, smiling happy people,
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:43.260]   you know, or in their warm baths or whatever may cause sausage fingers cause cause death,
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.300]   whatever, you know, and apparently that doesn't stop anybody.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:51.540]   It must, but does it frost you, Dr. Mom, when you, when your patients come to you and say,
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.380]   I saw that I should be using a Lestra.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.860]   What do you think?
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.020]   It really doesn't annoy me.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:01.460]   I think it annoys most physicians because we are so pushed these days, but you have to
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:05.580]   get patients through the office quickly because you have to see so many an hour to even break
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:10.260]   even that they're coming in and they're saying, well, I saw and okay here, go ahead and have
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.260]   it.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.700]   I mean, I just write this script and get out of my life.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.260]   Oh my God.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.380]   Have you seen the HBO documentary prime of the secretary about what happened with the
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.380]   opioids?
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.380]   No.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:22.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.380]   Accurately about how the drug companies were going out and lobbying doctors, come on, you
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.620]   got to write this, you got to write this.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:33.300]   And I remember when they told us you have to use the pain scales and everything and people
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.220]   should be pain free and such.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.220]   They knew what they were doing.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.980]   They marked it to the patients because they know the patients are going to come in and
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.220]   start bugging the doctor.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.180]   Why am I not on this terrific med?
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.940]   Now I like my patients to self advocate.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.540]   I like them to be intelligent.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.300]   I like them to come up and say, well, why am I using this instead of that?
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.900]   And then have an intelligent discussion with them.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:44:00.060]   But when they come in and they don't want to listen and it's an issue.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.060]   Yeah.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.300]   And it does upset most of us.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.300]   Thank you, Dr. Momma.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.380]   It's great to have you in the club.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.700]   I really appreciate that and have you in our discord.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.180]   If you have a, we're going to start doing this more in our shows.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:15.780]   If you have a, if you're in the club twit, Eastside live stage and you have a thought
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.660]   or a question or comment and you want to say something, raise your hand and we'll, we'll
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.300]   get you, we'll get you on.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.820]   I should mention when you talk about that opioid crisis in the Sackler family that
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:33.740]   got America hooked on OxyContin, it's so bad that they've offered to pay $4.3 billion
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.420]   for all this to go away.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:42.020]   $4.3 the family, the family has offered $4.3 million with a B dollars to make this all
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.380]   go away.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.500]   That gives you some idea of what the liability must be.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.180]   You know, if we some idea how much money they made.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:55.740]   Oh yeah, they got plenty left.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.220]   What if we gave you $4.3 billion?
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.420]   Would you, would you go away happy?
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.420]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:02.420]   Thank you, Dr. Momma.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.660]   It's great to talk to you.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.900]   Our show today brought to you by Casper.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.960]   I've been, I've been sleeping through the night lately and I think it might be this new
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.580]   Casper mattress we got.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.100]   I am in love.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:20.620]   This is the Casper cooling collection, brand new just in time for summer.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:24.300]   Everything you need to help you sleep cool all night long.
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:30.060]   Casper's mattresses have something they call the new snow technology that's to keep you
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.620]   cool, but then they put on top of it, you put the hyper light sheets, the lightweight
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.860]   duvets, the breathable mattress protector and you've got a combination design to keep
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.780]   you cool and comfortable.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.340]   You can't help but love your tomorrow.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.340]   Tomorrow's a new day.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.820]   Make the most of it with Casper's new cooling connection.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.260]   There I am opening up our Casper mattress.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.260]   This is a king.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.860]   It comes in a surprisingly compact box.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.580]   You open it up, it inflates.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:01.660]   It's not an inflatable mattress, but somehow they've sealed it and then it's, you don't
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.660]   have to air it out.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.660]   It smells great.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.660]   It's so comfortable.
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.380]   Better bedding makes for a better tomorrow.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:12.300]   Right on top of that, put the amazing breathable mattress protector.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.780]   You know, most mattress protectors are sealing in your heat, but this improves the coolness
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.540]   of the bed by allowing air to flow between your body and mattress.
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:24.380]   On top of that, the hyper light sheets design with an innovative grid weave that lets air
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.460]   flow through for maximum breathability.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:31.300]   On top of that, the lightweight duvets, you still get plush comfort, but optimal temperature
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.500]   control, you will sleep well this summer.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:39.300]   In fact, all year long, you want to avoid overheating because cooler sleep means better
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.300]   sleep and I have never slept better.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:48.180]   Better sleep means better tomorrow's as always Casper offers free shipping, free returns,
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:52.100]   but Casper's got mattresses for every budget, for every need.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.580]   My daughter just got her new apartment.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.660]   I set her up.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:01.500]   I got her the frame, the foundation, the mattress, the sheets, the pillows, everything.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   She loves it.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:06.340]   Imagine what tomorrow could be if you spent tonight on a Casper when it comes to a better
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:10.740]   night's sleep, Casper's new cooling collection as you covered.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.740]   Focus on tomorrow.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.380]   Let Casper handle the rest.

[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:36.020]   See Casper.com for more details.
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.020]   Thank you, Casper.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.020]   Uncle Leo.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.020]   Yes.
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.380]   I'm not going to run and go get my pillows or geeks.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.900]   I got the Casper pillows and I do have the hyper sheets.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.900]   Do you have those new sheets?
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.140]   Because I haven't tried those.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.140]   I want to try those.
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.140]   No.
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.580]   First of all, when you get in them, because I'm always looking for cool tech stuff because
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.020]   I guess I'm a big guy guy.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.580]   So when you get them, it's like ice.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.140]   I get feels so good on your skin.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.940]   And I don't know how it works, how it's breathable or whatever.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.620]   But if you just fluff it and put it back, it's almost like turning your pillow over.
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:07.300]   All you got to do is give it a little bit of air and then it just goes right back to
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.300]   be cool.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.300]   Isn't that the best part?
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.660]   When you flip your pillow over and it's hot from your head and you flip it over and it's
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.220]   fresh and cool, or you stick your feet in a different part of the bed and it's nice
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.220]   and cool, that's nice.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.220]   I like that.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.220]   Yes.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.140]   I got contacts on my cat and let me trade in the mattress.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.980]   You know what Dick D. Bartolo does?
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:29.260]   He's got a fan of it's designed for your bed.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.340]   It's at the foot of the bed and it blows up into the plate.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:36.700]   I don't know if that's a good idea.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.700]   That kind of freaks me out.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.620]   I don't need that kind of, I don't know.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.180]   Yeah, I don't know about that.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:42.740]   You see, I got to do a fluff.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:43.740]   I'm doing a fluff.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.580]   Fluff the sheets, that's all you need.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.940]   And by the way, I should mention in that cast red cat not included.
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:50.940]   That's my cat.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.700]   Does not come with a mattress.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:49:00.020]   I think we covered the pipeline.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.780]   Let's move on.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:11.420]   Apple this past week turned on their ATT, their application tracking stuff.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:17.060]   96% according to Flutter, which does these kinds of metrics.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:25.020]   90% of iPhone users who have the new iOS 14 5, 96% said when asked, "No, don't track
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.020]   me."
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.900]   This is exactly what Facebook was terrified of.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.180]   But there's an interesting side note to this.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.260]   It goes along, so Apple says, "No, no, no.
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.540]   We won't let anybody track you.
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.540]   We're privacy first."
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.500]   Google says, "No, no.
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.140]   Nobody wants third party cookies.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.140]   Chrome will not lose them."
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:47.360]   In fact, not only that, Chrome's going to invent this new thing called Flock that will
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.140]   keep you private, it will keep you anonymous.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.140]   Great piece.
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:59.140]   I wanted to give him credit from Eric Benjamin-Suford, mobile dev memo content at mobiledevmemo.com,
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:03.660]   titled "Apple Robbed the Mob's Bank."
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:10.220]   What he's pointing out is that Facebook, Google, Apple, all our first parties, they're
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.420]   not third parties.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:16.980]   You see it has on those platforms, they're served by those companies.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:20.900]   None of this slows down first party data collection.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.460]   In fact, Apple knows everything about you.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:26.940]   Facebook knows everything about you.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.780]   Google knows everything about you.
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:35.580]   They are not doing anything to stop that.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:43.940]   My proposal to the panel here, my question to the panel here is, "Is this hypocritical?"
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.660]   I'll ask you first, Wesley.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:50.540]   Is this hypocritical for Apple or Google to say, "Oh, yeah, we're not going to have any
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.300]   more tracking."
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:57.100]   Or is it pulling up the ladder and saying, "Yeah, we got everything we need."
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.700]   Good luck to the rest of you.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:05.540]   There's always going to be this thirst for data.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:11.100]   These companies who want to control that data, they'll have a lot of the power.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:17.340]   For fountains that are cut off from Facebook, they'll still be able to get it from even
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.980]   your carrier, from all these other sources.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.740]   They already have this data and they'll continue to collect it.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.340]   They just have to have other means.
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:31.020]   I think Apple is giving a false sense of security saying that we are more secure.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:35.180]   Also, I think part of that same story or a story later is that they're now going to be
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.620]   selling ads on the App Store.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:39.620]   Oh, really?
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.620]   The App Store?
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.620]   The App is going to sell ads.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:42.620]   It's going to be cool.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:49.580]   They just want more control and they think lack of control from these other sources if
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:54.140]   they can prop up their value.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:58.220]   It's just another way of delaying the inevitable.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.860]   The companies are going to get this data.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.180]   They may not get it from Apple, but they'll still have access in some other ways.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.180]   I should point out.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.180]   It's nice.
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:08.620]   It does feel nice to be able to say, "No, you can't have my data."
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:13.140]   That's going to, of course, just like everything in tech, it's going to hurt the smaller players
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.340]   more than it is the bigger office.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.580]   That's the point.
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:20.780]   You may click this button in iOS 14.5 that says, "Should I?"
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:21.780]   This is the button you see.
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:26.580]   Allow Facebook to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites.
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.220]   You can say, "Ask App Not to Track or Allow."
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.860]   Of course, everybody, 96 percent are clicking, "Ask App Not to Track."
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.220]   You can click that.
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:43.740]   That doesn't stop Facebook from knowing everything you're giving them all this information anyway.
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.300]   Facebook may not give this to advertisers.
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.500]   They gave it to Cambridge Analytical.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:54.660]   Although, actually, I'm going to ask you since you talked to Christopher.
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:58.700]   There's some evidence that Facebook Analytical was BSing everybody anyway, that they didn't
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.340]   really know all of them.
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:07.180]   If Facebook didn't give data to Cambridge Analytical, Cambridge Analytical used everything, well,
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:12.220]   they stole it for sure, but they stole it using tools that were openly available.
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.220]   Quizzles.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.220]   Yeah, quizzes.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:18.300]   They didn't have to run them, but what that quiz allowed them to do is use the Facebook
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.020]   API to get not just your profile information and a lot of friends.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.020]   Friends.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:26.260]   Mark those private, but it's your friends and your friends of friends.
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:31.740]   They used not just the data, but they were able to develop maps, maps of social relationships
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.700]   and maps of habits and behavior.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:39.300]   I think that that might be what you're getting at with Apple and with Google anytime they
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.020]   say, "Well, turn off," or, "This isn't an important data source."
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.580]   Leave them, right?
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:48.180]   Google saying, "Well, turn off third-party cookies."
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.580]   Because they don't care.
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:50.580]   Right.
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.580]   They definitely don't care.
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:55.580]   And Apple, that Facebook never wanted to give Cambridge Analytical that data because
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.340]   that's their secret sauce.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:02.980]   What they want to do is sell Cambridge Analytical, or in this case, the Trump campaign, access
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:06.300]   to this information without giving them the information.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.860]   So, they say, and the campaign used it very well in 2016, "Okay, if you want to target
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:17.260]   voters in this demographic, in this area, who perhaps are gun supporters, okay, we're
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:21.220]   not going to tell you that is, but you can buy ads against them."
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:27.140]   Which is to Wesley's point and the point that Facebook makes pretty openly, "Look, I disagree
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:31.060]   with Facebook quite often and I get into heated discussions with them, but they made very
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:36.060]   accurately the point that this change by Apple will also hurt small business.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.060]   I asked them why."
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:39.260]   And they say, "Well, it hurts their ability to target."
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:44.260]   Like, us big companies, we can target because we have all of these different options.
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:48.740]   Well, see, Dan, I'm trying to figure out why Facebook took out those full-page ads and
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.740]   everything.
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:50.980]   I mean, I think Facebook just didn't want it to happen.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:51.980]   Oh, they're terrifying.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:58.660]   And so, they used this, I think, red herring to get people to, but didn't work, by the
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.660]   way.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.220]   Everybody's still clicking that button.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:07.780]   But Facebook can still collect so much information that when a small business wants to buy an
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:11.380]   ad on Facebook, they're still going to be able to buy an efficient ad.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:13.460]   This is not cutting that off.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:19.620]   All this is cutting off is their ability to see what other apps you're using and to follow
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.620]   you geographically.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:25.940]   And as you said, Wesley, they could still buy that information from plenty of other places.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:27.540]   Why is Facebook so worried about this?
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.780]   I think they can make this up.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.940]   There's just one more data source.
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:31.940]   Okay.
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:40.620]   So, first of all, real quick, this is a live view of Apple's security.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.940]   Is this people getting searched as they go, "Oh boy, what a good search that was."
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.940]   The guy's touching their arms and hips.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:47.940]   That's it.
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:52.900]   Apple is very securely checking for our security.
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.900]   You have no guns on your bicep.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:55.900]   Oh, good.
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:56.900]   Okay.
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:57.900]   Go ahead.
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.820]   First of all, I'm about to go around to bend.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:09.300]   Anybody at Microsoft, Facebook, Google, you need to pay attention today.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:10.820]   You need to start.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:13.460]   Right now, Microsoft makes an Xbox 360 at Xbox.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:16.780]   They lose money at all the time, just so they can be in the market to try and get market
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.780]   shares.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:18.780]   They don't make any money from it, but they do it.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:19.780]   They need to get back into it.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.780]   They need to get back into it.
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.700]   Not to interrupt you, but we have just learned that Microsoft even after they sell the console
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.580]   and all the games still doesn't make any money.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:27.580]   Okay.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.580]   Go ahead.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:29.580]   I said they're operating at a loss.
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.580]   They're not making any money.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.900]   Apple, Epic trial, Microsoft admitted.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:35.660]   Yeah, we know Xbox never made any money.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:40.500]   They need to get back and they need to go steal anybody they can from Apple and start
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.740]   making phones again and make good phones.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.180]   They need to get into the market.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.860]   Apple right now is the mafia.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.780]   Apple's like, look, our own chips, our own processes, our own RAM.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:50.780]   You're out.
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:52.020]   We're cutting you at the meat.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.820]   Bye bye, Intel.
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:54.820]   You want marketing?
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.820]   Come talk to me about it because I'm running the cat on the cat on the ship.
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.380]   Yeah, they got to get through me to get to you.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.820]   Apple is about to mess up a lot of people in this industry.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:07.180]   And though it might seem like it's not a big deal and they're reasoning for doing it.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:11.700]   Yes, all these companies are evil, but Apple right now is just like the mafia.
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:16.100]   They are now, but how how is Apple's doing anything different than Google and Facebook?
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:21.460]   In every case, Facebook, Google and Apple are all saying, if you want to get to our users,
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.460]   you come to us.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:25.900]   We'll sell you access, but you have to buy it from us.
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:31.740]   So those people, those are their funds and Apple has such a large market share of phones,
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.220]   of people that you are going through them.
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:39.020]   Again, I'm seeing the long con in this and I'm looking like I said, I'm looking way around
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:44.020]   to bend on things that Apple's trying to do and manipulate the markets to benefit themselves
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.700]   and only themselves it seems like.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:50.700]   It's just, I don't know, I feel like everybody else needs to start teaming up against Apple
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.620]   because Apple's got a plan.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.220]   This isn't the first step.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.900]   I mean, last, this is the first step.
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:02.420]   They also just released these terrifyingly accurate or at least according to our headline,
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:06.460]   little IOT devices that are dirt cheap and you can throw in all sorts of stuff.
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:10.620]   Yeah, I got one in my pocket if anybody wants to track me.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.620]   Oh.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.620]   Where'd you put it?
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.020]   By the way, I think those are hacked already, right?
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:17.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:23.340]   Yeah, there's a whole stalking thing, but any one of these is potentially, I mean, any
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.260]   Bluetooth tracker could be used for stalking.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:27.740]   Frankly, you want to stalk somebody, just get something on their phone.
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.140]   That's a much better way to do it.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.140]   Go ahead.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.140]   I'm sorry, Wes.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:36.500]   Facebook doesn't really, they do care about this Apple change, but it's less so because
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:37.820]   it's kind of universal.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:41.540]   They're not losing anything that everyone else is not losing.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:47.020]   What they're really scared of is a trend of these features rolling out on these different
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:48.020]   providers.
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.020]   If everybody does.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:53.900]   And everyone locks up, they just don't want that trend to happen, so they're trying to
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:58.220]   stop it right now, or at least give it some friction to slow it down.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:03.700]   But the truth is, it's just work on their side to integrate more services and more data
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.100]   pipes to kind of like fluff up profiles.
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:12.540]   So they can work around this new Apple change, but they just want it not to be the first
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:17.500]   domino in a set that kind of removes slowly their power.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:24.460]   I wonder if Facebook, which is notorious for being very paranoid and buying up anybody
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:28.580]   or shutting down anybody that could compete with them, I wonder Facebook is actually feels
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:32.940]   the same way Owen does, that the real threat and the real long run is a monolithic Apple
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:37.980]   that controls the entire platform and controls all the data from that platform.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:40.620]   You think that's kind of Epic's argument too, right?
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:43.140]   It is Epic's argument.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:46.700]   It's a shame that it's Epic arguing that.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:47.700]   I'm arguing it too.
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.700]   I'm down here.
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:49.700]   It's my problem.
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.180]   Proton Mills arguing it.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.180]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.660]   Hey is arguing it.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.380]   That's true.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.380]   Is it the App Store?
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:00.580]   I mean most of those are afraid of the App Store, right?
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:06.380]   Yeah, I mean the argument, each of these other companies have different ancillary grievances
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.580]   with Apple, but it's kind of their fear.
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:12.460]   I mean the long game is what Owen points out rightfully, like everybody is kind of afraid
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.820]   of a monolithic Apple.
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:20.420]   But Epic is contending and what others contend is that Apple says the iPhone competes along
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:27.060]   with the PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch and if you don't want to play Fortnite on
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:31.540]   the iPhone, you can play it on any number of competing devices.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:41.060]   Epic is arguing that the iPhone is itself a market and the App Store is on top of iOS.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:46.980]   These are all unique markets and Apple has all of these locked up and because of that
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:51.380]   they have created a monolith that is the iPhone and then you switch to these services
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.420]   that Apple is now selling and you have this entire ecosystem.
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:01:00.500]   It's really what just Owen is describing, this ecosystem monolithic Apple where you want
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.340]   anything, you got to come through me.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.580]   It's funny.
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:10.540]   For years when Microsoft was such a dominant monopoly and Apple was the second weakling
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:16.580]   I said, if you think Microsoft's bad with their monopoly, just be glad Apple doesn't
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.660]   have it.
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:21.100]   And now that Apple does, I think I'm fortunately, I think I was right.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:25.180]   I was just going to make that point that Apple is the new Microsoft.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:32.300]   In some ways, the downfall of Microsoft wasn't them being too aggressive is that they were
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.940]   so dominant and people felt like they had to use it.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.580]   Not necessarily that they wanted to use it.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.220]   Yeah, nobody has to use Apple stuff, do they?
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.260]   As they log in their ecosystem, people are going to start feeling that way.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:44.260]   You want to.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:48.980]   And as soon, and we are hearing like some people are saying that some Microsoft laptops are
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:53.820]   better than Apple laptops on some regards, especially when the keyboard, butterfly keyboard
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.420]   fiasco happened.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:02.100]   If people feel more locked in, when a competitor comes up with something that's better, people
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:07.420]   will start jumping ship because they will stop having to use that hardware stack that
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:11.940]   might be closed and might jump into an open ecosystem that works with a variety of different
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:12.940]   kind of products.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:13.940]   Oh, I wish it was true.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.540]   It's just like Apple is just so good right now.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.340]   I wish that were true at that point.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.340]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:21.860]   But it's it still can happen, but just, Apple is really good right now.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:26.700]   We are not at the tipping point where people are trying to jump off, but like we're going
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:32.020]   to talk about like Google and their next pixel, pixel having their own SOCs.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.420]   People are learning this playbook.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.620]   You see Microsoft making their own SOCs.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.620]   It's the return of the silo.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.620]   It's going to happen.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.620]   It's going to happen.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.340]   They're going to lose their advantage.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.340]   It may not be today.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.780]   It may not be next year, but it's going to happen.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:49.420]   If people feel locked in, they're going to just jump ship when there is a viable number
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.580]   one solution outside of that ecosystem.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.620]   You know, these air techs are a really good example.
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.020]   They're the best because of a billion iPhones.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:01.220]   If you live in the Apple and if you don't have an iPhone, it's much easier to stock people
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.220]   who have Android phones.
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:06.100]   And so you better get an iPhone to defend yourself against them.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:10.100]   And if you don't have a modern iPhone, then you can't point your iPhone to find out where
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.380]   your keys fell into the sofa.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:17.740]   Everything works better if you live in Apple's beautiful, warm, well, it's covered.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.180]   Can they just kill tile?
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.740]   And they basically killed tile.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.220]   Well, I just bought air tags.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.140]   I mean, I partnered with tile and tile.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.340]   Tile did something interesting though to save themselves.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.820]   Before we get onto that, hold on.
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:28.820]   Hold the thought.
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:32.820]   I want to let Taylor Sunderhouse, who has raised his hand in our discord to comment,
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:33.820]   "Hi, Taylor."
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:39.100]   Hey guys, hey, I just had a thought and I was kind of doing the math on this in my head
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.380]   as you guys were talking.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:48.020]   So compared to most platforms like Google and others, Apple takes tight control on everything
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:54.220]   their app store, what goes on their phones, you know, all this different type of stuff.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:59.700]   And because of that, I think they can easily implement kind of the privacy aspect because
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.660]   they retain most control.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:10.100]   But I'm wondering here lately with the Epic and Apple lawsuit and this new privacy implementation
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:17.060]   they did about tracking, I wonder if it's more about control over privacy.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.100]   So I just kind of want to respond to that.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.620]   That's exactly what we're saying, Taylor.
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:24.540]   I think you nailed it, which is, you know, Apple will paint it as we're doing this for
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.540]   you.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.180]   We're protecting you.
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:31.820]   So the interesting side effect is it gives them absolute information and absolute control
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.500]   over that information.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.860]   So there's a benefit to Apple that is different from just being the nice, friendly privacy
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:38.860]   company.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.420]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.900]   Agreed.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:48.340]   And I really hope that Apple doesn't go in the advertising model either with--
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.140]   Well, it looks like they are.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.140]   That's what's really interesting.
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.860]   They're starting to sell ads now.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.860]   Do you remember?
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.700]   Yeah, I had failed.
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.740]   So in one way, people have said, well, Apple only is doing this because they don't have
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.740]   an ad platform.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:01.740]   Well, interesting.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.500]   They now, they are selling ads again.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.020]   Taylor, thank you for being a member of the club and thanks for participating with us.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.020]   I appreciate it.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.020]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:13.900]   All right, take care.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.340]   I want to take a little break.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:19.100]   By the way, we'll just mention, give it a little plug.
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:25.960]   If you're in club Twitch, $7 a month, add free versions of all of our shows via RSS.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.140]   We also get access to this Discord, which is really a lot of fun.
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.540]   We've been doing some great stuff.
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.180]   We're also starting to test out some shows we did on the Linux show in there last night.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.180]   I wasn't there.
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.180]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.180]   I missed it.
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:39.580]   But there's some really fun things going on.
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:42.980]   And then, of course, there's the Twitch Plus feed, which is stuff that fell on the cutting
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.740]   floor specials.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:49.380]   We are going to be doing-- and I think we'll do it in public for sure.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:52.540]   Andy Weir, who I've interviewed both times and his last two books, The Martian, which
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:57.800]   was an incredible book and motion picture, and then his most recent was Artemis.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.800]   He's released a new book called Project Hail Mary.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.040]   John, you finished it.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.040]   I'm halfway through.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.400]   I can't put it down.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.880]   And as soon as we started reading, I said, get me Andy Weir.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.440]   And I think we're going to interview Andy Weir on Friday.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:16.520]   So the show that we used to do, that we interviewed Andy on in previous times, was triangulation.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:21.440]   But we canceled that show because of lack of listenership and mostly lack of ad support.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.320]   Now thanks to the club, we could do stuff like that, shows like that.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.820]   So we will do that.
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.820]   We'll do it.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.940]   I think-- I haven't heard back from Andy yet, but I believe we're going to do a 3PM on Friday,
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.700]   Pacific, 6PM Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:38.220]   John, make sure we get the fireplace fired up for that.
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:42.380]   And then-- and we'll put it out on-- I guess we'll put it on the triangulation feed and
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.420]   events feed.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.100]   But there is a benefit for club Twitch members.
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.940]   If you want to ask a question, we're going to spin up a live stage as we've done this
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.640]   time and we will give people a chance to ask Andy Weir questions during the interview
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.640]   as well.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.320]   So another reason, another benefit to a club Twitch.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.440]   If you want to know more, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:03.920]   That's it on my self-serving stuff.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.320]   I know Wesley, you're an open source advocate.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.560]   You believe in non-proprietary.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:17.520]   I wish I could say that the future was in open and non-proprietary stuff, that things
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.420]   like I message would interoperate with Android messages.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:26.900]   And we would live in this magical world where there weren't silos and walled gardens.
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:32.120]   But it's pretty clear that, at least for the short term, walled gardens are the most
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.140]   profitable thing to do.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:38.340]   And as you point out, I think all three companies, Microsoft, Google and Apple, are moving strongly
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.340]   in that direction.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:42.140]   AOL used to be really powerful.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:46.340]   Yes, walled gardens are great until they're not.
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:52.340]   It's assuming that this is going to last forever, is going against all the pattern of history,
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.900]   the ebb and flow of technology.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.540]   So yes, it's good for now, but I don't expect it to continue forever.
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:07:59.540]   I hope you're right.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.540]   I really do.
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.700]   I do think the exact opposite of that.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:09.340]   It will last forever because if it's not, okay, if Godzilla is not coming to get you
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:13.700]   his monster, okay, if it's not monster, it can come.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.860]   Somebody coming to kill you, okay?
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:16.860]   The monsters, all the monsters.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:19.460]   But in the movies, the good guys always win.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.020]   No, no, no, I'm done.
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:22.340]   I'm about a reality right now.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:26.260]   These monsters get killed by other monsters that come to point to you saying, God's ill
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.220]   and monster, you're talking about reality.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.140]   Okay, I'm just going to be quick.
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.140]   Exactly.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.140]   That's the one I'm saying.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:38.140]   The Apple will be crushed by a bigger, dominant monster of a new Apple.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:41.980]   Yes, and they're not coming in to be nice or be cool or be like, hey, I know they messed
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.980]   up.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.980]   Let's have a party and a beer.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:46.220]   They're coming and saying, we're doing it better than them.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.220]   They're the old dinosaur.
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:48.820]   We're putting them out the pasture.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.860]   Roll with us because that's your only choice.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.860]   Mafia.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:53.860]   It just keeps going.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.860]   Wesley, I don't know.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.420]   It's not a competing model.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:00.500]   Like you live long enough to either die or become the villain.
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.020]   And so there you go.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.340]   There is going to be a new player.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.780]   It's going to seem like the greatest thing.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.660]   And then it's going to turn evil and we're going to start to cycle all over again.
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:10.660]   So I agree with you.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.660]   That's a good way.
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.660]   That's a good way to put it.
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:18.340]   It's just a cycle and we're going to keep flip flopping all the time.
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:19.340]   Love you guys.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.340]   Let's take a break.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.580]   We'll have more with our great panel Dan Patterson CBS news.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.580]   Western.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   Dapper Dan.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:26.580]   Dapper Dan.
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.580]   Yeah, he is Dapper today.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.580]   You are living up to your name.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.580]   Dapper Dan.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.620]   They've got the necktie and everything.
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.380]   Mr. Owen JJ Stone.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:35.380]   Oh, doctor.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:40.660]   His phone number is 844-986-4563.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.660]   Text him.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.660]   He's busy.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.660]   He's doing a show.
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:44.660]   Doing a show.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:45.660]   Doing a show.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.700]   And of course Wesley Faulkner.
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:52.620]   Developer advocate neuro diversity advocate at Wesley 88.
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:54.140]   Is that the best way to get ahold of you?
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.140]   83.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.540]   I can't read it because of the white wall.
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:10:01.780]   You need a darker wall or we need maybe we need red lower thirds.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:02.780]   There it is.
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.780]   Put your arm up.
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.780]   Okay.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.780]   I said it right this time.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:06.780]   Wesley 83.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.540]   Is that the best way to get ahold of you Wesley?
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:13.060]   If you've got a fabulous job for this wonderful person?
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:17.860]   Unlike Leo, I love Twitter.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:18.860]   Jack.
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:19.860]   Jack.

[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.700]   to go to the post office and buy a stamp and lick it and put it on the envelope.

[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:57.140]   You could print with your computer and your printer.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:03.260]   Again, no special ink, no postage meter, 24/7 for any kind of mail, any letter, any package,
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.620]   any class, anywhere you want to send it.
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:10.380]   You'll even automatically fill in information from your webpage, from your contact list.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.540]   There's no typing involved if you're sending overseas.
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.700]   It'll automatically fill out the forms.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:19.420]   If you're sending confirmation priority mail, it'll fill out the forms.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.780]   Then once your mail is ready, you schedule a pickup.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:27.820]   A uniformed member of the United States government, your mailman, will come and pick it up and
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:28.820]   drop it off.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.140]   It's just that simple.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:35.820]   This counts up to 40% off post office rates, up to 66% off UPS shipping rates.
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.460]   Tell you, pro tip with stamps.com is so easy and eighth grader could use it because that's
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.460]   what Leah uses.
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.460]   Does she?
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.460]   Does send her soaps?
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.460]   I love it.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.980]   I thought I saw stamps on there.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:45.980]   That's awesome.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:48.340]   She's smart.
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:51.820]   Stamps.com, it's a fraction of the cost of expensive post-in-meters.
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:55.540]   If you're doing that, you welcome the 21st century.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.540]   It's a no-brainer.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.540]   You'll save time.
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.540]   You'll save money.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.780]   Get at the post office.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.420]   Stop wasting time going to the post office.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.620]   Go to stamps.com.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.300]   There's no risk.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.020]   The promo code for our show is TWIT.
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:09.300]   Clever, huh?
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.300]   TWIT.

[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.500]   It's the best offer they have on their website.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:31.380]   I'm just telling you, stamps.com, promo code TWIT.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:35.100]   Never go to the post office again, unless you want to say hi to your very nice mail carrier,
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.420]   because they're good people.
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.820]   But you don't need to.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.540]   Stamps.com, promo code TWIT.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:45.180]   We thank you so much for their support of this week in Tech.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:50.660]   Let's real quick get a little bit of a, I don't know, a highlight reel from some of
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.500]   the fun stuff that happened this week on TWIT.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.660]   There's a vaccine song.
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.580]   You want to try the vaccine song?
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:03.180]   Let's celebrate that we have the vaccine to help us bring a change to this older team,
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.500]   helping us get back to what we love.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.620]   Google Stock just went down 20%.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:13.900]   Previously on TWIT, this week in Google.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:19.900]   Project Matter, formerly known as Project Kit, is Amazon Sidewalk, where the two most
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:23.980]   exciting things that are going to happen in IoT of all of this year.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:28.740]   Pretty much this is a universal network in at least, if you're not in the back woods.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:29.740]   Yes, it is so exciting.
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.660]   Let's say you want to build a garden sensor.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.820]   You know, you could just build something to throw out in people's gardens on the Sidewalk
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:36.820]   network.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.460]   I just assume it would work.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:42.860]   This week in Enterprise Tech, we're going to go to deep dive into Wi-Fi security and
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:47.820]   our expert guests today, Jim Palmer, will take us through a new vulnerability that might
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:50.700]   affect almost every host and client out there.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:55.580]   It was called Frag Attacks, and it's because it's not an attack against the cryptography
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:15:01.060]   and the encryption itself, it makes it even more challenging to understand.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.540]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:08.060]   Interesting YouTube from a guy who's taken the air tag, stripped off the unnecessary
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.460]   stuff and made it wallatable.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:16.340]   Glad that Apple didn't just arbitrarily say, "Well, fill this chamber with argon gas,
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:20.940]   and if the gas goes away, we will disable the entire thing just to be the company based
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:21.940]   on no fun."
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.980]   To it, the happiest place on earth.
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.100]   Maybe they did fill it with argon gas, but it just wasn't enough to kill you.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.100]   Could it be?
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.100]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.100]   It's inert, so it couldn't kill you.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.540]   Just would suffocate you.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.540]   That's all.
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:41.260]   We should actually talk about what Stacey called the biggest story of the year.
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:44.540]   We were talking about tile and how hard it was going to be to compete against Apple
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.140]   with air tags, and tile knew this.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:51.180]   In fact, it made me wonder why tile didn't jump on Apple's offer to join the Find My
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.180]   Network.
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.740]   They offered it to any third party.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.420]   Chipolo, a competitor, did it, but not Tracker.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:02.500]   We found out a week later, Tracker has announced they're partnering with Amazon and they will
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.620]   be part of Amazon's sidewalk network.
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:07.860]   That is very interesting.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:13.060]   It's probably the only reasonable way any Tracker compete against Apple's billion iPhones.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:17.660]   The sidewalk is a network that is turned on probably without your knowledge.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:25.340]   By default, if you have a late model Amazon Echo device, it is a low bandwidth, but long
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:28.100]   range network.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:32.500]   If enough people within, say, a half mile radius, that's about how far it'll go.
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.860]   Enough people have it.
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:38.820]   Your whole neighborhood will be blanketed with sidewalk, which means your Tracker, suddenly
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:43.980]   your tile could be seen in a lot more places.
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.980]   What is going on?
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:50.660]   Should we, Dan, I'm going to ask you first, should we worry about Amazon's sidewalk?
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.540]   Definitely, we should worry.
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:56.100]   How did I know that?
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:17:01.060]   I mean, Stacey in the house had there kind of hit the nail on the head, right?
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:08.220]   This is consumer IoT, or at least it really looks like consumer IoT that is no fuss, no
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.220]   fuss, right?
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:15.260]   If you don't have, no fuss, no fuss, you may not even know you're a part of the network.
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:16.260]   Right.
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:17.260]   Right.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.260]   Maybe you should fuss.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:22.940]   Definitely, it must, but it's still consumer IoT.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:27.820]   Amazon says, and Stacey agrees they've done a lot to, aware of the fact that people are
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:32.220]   going to be concerned about this, make it very private, fully multiple layers of encryption.
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:35.620]   It doesn't reveal anything about you.
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:40.300]   You can disable it, but it's on by default on any modern echo device within the last
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.220]   few years.
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:46.180]   I talked when it first came out, when they first announced it, I showed people on one
[01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:49.860]   of our shows how to turn it off, but then I just kind of forgot about it.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:52.060]   I guess that's Amazon's plan.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.980]   You know, pay no attention.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:58.620]   On the other hand, there's a huge benefit from sidewalk if they did in fact implement
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:05.580]   security and privacy well, because now you have this low bandwidth, but long, long, long,
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:06.580]   long range network.
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:15.700]   It's actually a low raw, which means you can use it for all kinds of interesting IoT outside
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.700]   the house.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.300]   Owen, would you-
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.300]   Try to make it and say-
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.300]   Go ahead, Wesley.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.300]   Go ahead.
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.300]   You start.
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.300]   I was going to say this is scary to me.
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.820]   This is actually something that I don't want to happen.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:31.380]   So have you gone through all your echo devices and disabled it?
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.020]   I don't own any of that stuff.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.020]   That's why.
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:39.020]   This is the same company behind the Ring doorbells that were selling via to law enforcement.
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:40.980]   They're on sidewalk also.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:41.980]   Exactly.
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:46.380]   It's like if tile is now going to be part of this network, they're going to be able
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:51.980]   to track a large percentage of the population and probably sell this over to law enforcement
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:57.420]   or any entity that's willing to pay or that they feel should have this data and this is
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.420]   scary.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.140]   I don't trust Amazon.
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:05.460]   I don't trust Google, but I trust Amazon so much less with personal data because they
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:12.260]   have shown poor choice on who they allow access to that data.
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.420]   From that standpoint, that's why I'm scared of them being able to track more and more
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.900]   people of where they've been, where they're going.
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:28.900]   Think about this sidewalk network in a future protest that's going to happen and they're
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:35.620]   able to figure out who had these tags, not just the tags, but the phone app that runs
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:40.860]   tile that now they can understand who is part of this group.
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:47.740]   It's scary in terms of tracking and surveillance and it's kind of being ushered in as a fight
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:55.460]   against Apple, but I think they're going in bed with an enemy that it's going to probably
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:20:02.180]   guarantee their survival, but also it's going to be just worse off for everyone.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180]   I don't know enough.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:09.500]   I've read the white paper, which is very clear and I don't know enough about security to weigh
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.500]   in.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:14.100]   I mean, we should get Steve Gibson to look at it, but it seems to be that paying very good
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:19.860]   attention to privacy and security at Amazon is.
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:24.340]   It's clear that they understand that people are going to say, "Oh, Amazon, uh-oh."
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:27.700]   But I think that they are being very proactive about that.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.860]   If we trust Apple, I think we could trust Amazon.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.860]   Okay.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.860]   Okay.
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:33.860]   We don't trust Apple.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:38.220]   I don't want to say, "Don't save because we trust Apple."
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:44.660]   First and foremost, I have Blink, Amazon security cameras everywhere.
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:45.660]   Why?
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.220]   Because they finally came out with a little box where it's internal to me and I have
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.380]   my own SD card where it records everything.
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:51.380]   Nothing goes to cloud.
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.340]   It all comes to me and goes directly to my phone.
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.340]   You should look at Wise.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.340]   Wise does that too.
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:56.340]   WYC.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:58.340]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:59.940]   I got an EFI doorbell cam and other cameras again with my own little substation where
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.180]   everything comes to my personal cloud.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.140]   I mean, if something happens, I'm the only ones going to survive because I'm the only
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.140]   ones going to know.
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:06.140]   But still, I've got-
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:09.420]   If we could only get into your highly secure data vault, we could find out who murdered
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.420]   Owen JJ Stone.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:11.420]   Exactly.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:16.420]   So, I mean, a lot of these companies, even Amazon, are starting to give options to non-cloud
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:17.500]   conformity.
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:18.820]   But I'll tell you the biggest thing.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.780]   First of all, if you've got this, Wesley, it's already over for you.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:25.060]   If you take this anywhere with you, it doesn't matter who you like or who you don't like.
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:27.020]   One of these things has got you tracking.
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:31.260]   The thing that this doesn't have going for it, I have spent a good chunk of money on these
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.260]   devices.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:35.580]   And let me tell you the one difference I've learned in the last three weeks of having
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.780]   an Apple device versus this.
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.060]   This works 64% of the time.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.900]   It's not going to- You want some money to track you with this?
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.340]   Good luck with that because these don't work all the time.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:48.140]   That Apple tag, I got a little survey going on right now.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:51.380]   I put one in a mailbox and sent it on down to my sister, Nerv Kallani.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.380]   That's what I'm watching that thing.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.180]   Panko, Tukoski, Westruk, Largo.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.980]   It ain't losing nothing.
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:58.740]   These things, I go across the street and lose this bad boy.
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.820]   So I go ahead and link this quote.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.260]   Sure, you want to know what you want to do?
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.660]   But Wesley raises such a good-
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:06.660]   No, no, no, no.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.020]   He's saying it works 64% of the time.
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.020]   They got it up there.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.820]   They're quality control.
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.740]   Before I got to worry about Amazon street coming up-
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:17.300]   But aren't these encroaching?
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.820]   I mean, I totally agree.
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:21.500]   If you have your phone, you're being traced everywhere.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:29.620]   I also agree with Wesley that no matter what, enhancing or adding to these networks, not
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:34.660]   only does it add capability to people who might not have your or my or protesters best
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:35.660]   interest in mind.
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:37.380]   Wow, that's a good point.
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:42.460]   But it also erodes our- Look, we've given up so much.
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:47.260]   Do you remember when it was a big deal that apps were apps and they weren't part of the
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.340]   worldwide web and they weren't connected?
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:50.940]   They were kind of siloed.
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.700]   Everybody was up in arms about that.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:58.500]   We have given up so much in this march towards inevitable technological progress.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.380]   And I'm a tech person.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:04.020]   But I think that Wesley is on to something like if we continue to add these networks
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.100]   that just track us and surveil us.
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.260]   AirTags included in our phones.
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:14.900]   Are we giving up some mental peace of mind or something that was human piece by piece?
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:15.900]   We lost that war.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:16.900]   That war is over.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:17.900]   We've already given up.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:18.900]   Yeah, okay.
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:19.900]   You're right.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:20.900]   I believe you, Owen.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.140]   I am again, I think you're right.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.700]   I think we lost that war.
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:24.780]   We have lost that war.
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:26.980]   There's no- That cat is out of the bag.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.340]   I don't know what that expression means, but I mean-
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:29.340]   Is it okay that I-
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:30.900]   How do I get in the bag?
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:37.300]   Do I still want humans to exist and like have like- I don't know that tech is inherently
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.820]   good or bad, but I don't know that-
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.060]   It's brought us some benefits.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:42.060]   My best interest.
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:43.060]   Don't you agree?
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.060]   It is.
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.860]   I'm not saying it hasn't, but it's also brought us some other terrifying realities, isn't
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:49.860]   it?
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:55.740]   Yeah, well, but like anything, like any technology, I mean nuclear power, same thing.
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.860]   There's pros and cons.
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:00.220]   You know, there's the Hiroshima bomb, but there's also-
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.220]   Cheap power.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.220]   Cheap power.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.220]   Cheap power.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:09.140]   By the way, I just want to thank you, Wesley, for upgrading your appearance to match Dapper
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.140]   Dans.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:11.140]   Thank you.
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:14.900]   Thank you. Take down his lower third because you can't see it, but he's wearing a nice,
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.820]   beautiful purple clip on time.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:17.820]   Excellent.
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.820]   I'm sorry, I'm trying to-
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:23.260]   We're really upgrading this show at this point, I have to say.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.460]   You need to raise my game.
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.940]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:32.340]   Traxionic in the Discord says, "Amitting that the war is lost is part of the problem.
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:33.540]   Don't give up."
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.380]   Are you giving up prematurely, Owen?
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:39.140]   Are we users or are we humans?
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:44.340]   Let me tell you something, as I sit here preparing to eat this lovely spaghetti on air.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.340]   By the way, I like your bib.
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:47.980]   It's not exactly a necktie.
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:51.460]   I don't smell my spaghetti dinner on myself because I know these shows are going off.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.020]   Are you having- Wait a minute, what are you eating?
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.020]   Is it chef poiardis?
[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:55.020]   Is it spaghetti-o?
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:56.020]   Oh, it's Owen Boredi.
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:58.420]   I make the best meatballs this side.
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:00.340]   Oh, we're gonna have to have a meatball off.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.340]   Oh, man, look at that.
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:03.020]   God, that's how you come out right.
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:06.580]   Listen to me.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:11.140]   We are our human beings and we do things the best we can until we tear it down.
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:16.100]   The world is always and always has been a beautiful, horrible place.
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:21.300]   Slavery, expansion, hugs, imperialism, baby.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.020]   It's just what it is.
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:27.420]   The privacy game, the whole tracking thing, the addiction to phones that are now computers
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:32.260]   in your hand that if you don't have them, you're basically living in a third world environment
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.900]   and you are struggling to get anything done.
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:38.780]   We've given up, like he said, we gave up so much, we've already given it up.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.100]   We've already lost that.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.500]   So now it's gonna be the whole thing up.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.180]   We used to worry about the government spying on you and tracking you on all kinds of stuff.
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:48.460]   We're literally tracking ourselves, telling on ourselves.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.780]   We dry snitch on everything that we do because we're posting our food, our dog, everything.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.380]   People are like, "Oh, I want to practice it."
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:55.380]   You put everything out there.
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:58.220]   I know what kind of season you put on your salads, okay?
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:01.100]   I know what's going on in your life because you tell everybody.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:05.860]   So I feel like we've already given that up and at some point, we're just gonna need
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.300]   a hug because it gets to a beautiful, harmful place.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:10.500]   I don't really have an answer to how it ends.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.500]   I didn't want this to be a...
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.900]   Oh, by the way, how do you like that?
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:21.340]   Now I look like a Chippendale dancer.
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:22.340]   Not exactly.
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:23.500]   Okay, well...
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:26.260]   Thank you for your...
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:30.620]   You're like P.E. Herman.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.780]   I've put on a...
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.460]   For those of you listening, I put on a red bow tie.
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:38.980]   So now, Owen's got a bib and a meatball tie.
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:43.460]   Wesley's got a purple clip on and of course Dan is in his...
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.460]   Yeah, for Dan.
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.460]   Oh, CBS radio news.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:47.460]   And five minutes is from the internet.
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:48.460]   Radio news.
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:49.460]   Radio news.
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:50.460]   Radio.
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:51.460]   If you say in radio.
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:52.460]   It's not radio, is it TV?
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.460]   No, just TV.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.460]   It's TV as it is.
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:55.460]   I mean, I love radio.
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.460]   Wait a minute.
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.140]   CBSN is not radio.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.140]   It's TV.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:01.140]   Wow.
[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:02.580]   But I work for just CBS News.
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:03.580]   Like just the...
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:05.380]   Do you do TV hits for them?
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:07.380]   I know.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:08.380]   I thought you were a radio guy.
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:09.380]   I don't know why I thought you were a radio guy.
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:10.380]   You want Twitter.
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:13.780]   I worked for ABC News Radio 10 years ago in 2008.
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:15.180]   I'm stuck in the 2000s.
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:20.580]   No, I mean, when I started doing "Twit," I was working for ABC News Radio.
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:22.500]   But yeah, yeah, I mean, we do hit...
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.500]   Do you...
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.500]   Are you a reporter?
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:33.980]   CBS and right now it's like a streaming news service like CBS news but it's a stream yeah
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:40.140]   but so you would appear on here if I were watching this yeah but also won CBS this morning evening
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:47.460]   news oh I didn't know that God you're like a big shot now I I mean I know you know I'm a podcast
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:55.060]   you're from Twitter and Patterson is a reporter for CBS news at MoneyWatch and hashtag CBSN he
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:28:00.100]   covers there you are look at that with lights and prompter's what is that Park City Utah where
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:14.220]   are you no that's Davos oh excuse me excuse me here is in Davos everybody did they have Davos
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:21.380]   this year yeah but it was digital Davos they're doing it again in Singapore I think I mean it's
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:29.820]   really maybe 2022 in Switzerland oh you've interviewed Frederick Brennan oh Fred I mean I
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:35.900]   have known Fred for a long time he's a very helpful individual he's and he's a good guy he's the
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:43.340]   founder of eight chain and he figures large in this recent QAnon documentary it's essential that
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:49.540]   documentary look at we don't need to rabbit hole this conversation into no I rabbit hold it so
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:57.300]   you're off the hook I'm the one but I mean look if if QAnon or conspiracies like QAnon and even
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:03.980]   misinformation is the is the end point of what happens on social this phenomenon that that we've
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:11.100]   been talking about here on Twitter but it also percolated on places like Facebook Twitter YouTube
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:17.500]   Instagram and but it was in fact eight-chan and it's success well started on 4chan 4chan
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:24.740]   a larp with yeah yeah yeah somebody and then jump to a Chan and was metastasized there and
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:29.740]   people like Fred were there at the time he he kind of helped it sure why on that documentary I was
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:37.260]   starting to think Fred might have been Q yeah he's definitely not I mean he understood we were look
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:43.220]   I had nothing I didn't understand this group I had heard about them in early 2018 but I was
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:51.340]   docked and sent I mean you were easiest in 20 in the fall of 2018 I covered mass shooting in
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:30:00.140]   Pittsburgh and as a result of that I had the synagogue shooting yeah yeah and that was that
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:05.420]   was CBSN and we were live on air for that for quite a while and we were talking about this
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:14.380]   phenomenon but it it blew up and the doxing and death threats were so severe I mean look this
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:22.460]   for wording on a mass shooting everyone who covers QAnon has the same experience they will
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:27.900]   dox you brigade you they will share your information in private channels some of them claim that they
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:33.180]   also use bots to amplify some of the harassment but it was every single time I would go on air
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:38.940]   within seconds my Twitter would light up I mean I shut down Facebook and Instagram I deleted those
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:43.660]   accounts years ago and and my wife and I have both gone through and we've gone through with the
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:50.460]   FBI as well everything that could be public to find and eliminate our physical location Cal
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:55.980]   and that's why you're in the witness protection program in upper New York state well we talked to
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:31:01.260]   the FBI and what they would often say is that we can't tell you the particulars about a case for
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:06.300]   about a particular instance but what we can tell you is when there are things that might impact you
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:11.180]   so yes this incident like Thanksgiving morning I woke up to a threat that just said you're effing
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:17.100]   dead in 2020 not a big deal we had the IP address and we sent it to the FBI but they come back and
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:21.580]   they say we don't tell you particulars especially when it comes to ongoing investigations like what
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:27.820]   we're doing with you even if you're the victim well what they will tell you is that like this is an
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:34.060]   actionable this this came from an actionable suspect and they told us that this was in Houston and that
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:40.780]   we should look again this is a long conversation take it serious not about me yes take it seriously
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:47.900]   CBS took it seriously like I mean I had detail going to it from work for quite a while lord I had
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:53.180]   no idea Dan I'm but it's not ever it's not me though I mean like it's interesting to share this but
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:58.860]   what's important to know is that it's not about me every reporter who covered QAnon and similar
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:05.740]   conspiracies experienced the exact same thing and what that means is that it's systemic harassment
[01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:12.460]   designed to attack those who are talking about these right we can laugh at these emerging conspiracies
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:18.380]   but these emerging conspiracies who had political motivations and the way this ties into tech is
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:25.580]   that these were weaponized they metastasized on Facebook in particular yes and although we can
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:31.020]   talk about H-N and 4chan those were teeny in comparison to what happened on Facebook and it's
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:37.580]   not just happening to me it's happening to so many people that once Facebook cut off the spigot and
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:44.380]   Twitter cut off QAnon you could instantly see this change like suddenly there was not this huge flood
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:49.660]   of harassment and threats coming from them and again how this applies to tech is
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:56.860]   algorithms that are designed for engagement do far more harm than they foster this yeah yeah
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:33:02.380]   and not intentionally I didn't mean to talk no no no I in fact I have many more questions I brought
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:08.460]   it up because I mentioned Frederick did you've seen the documentary is it good oh yeah it's great I
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:15.100]   mean I want to make sure it's reliable I guess is what yes exactly and when we look I'm not
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:20.060]   talking poorly about our friends who work at places that do other documentaries there were
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:24.060]   some documentaries that were poorly produced that came out last fall and through the winter
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:29.900]   because they were sensationalist and because they didn't focus on what I just talked about which
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:36.940]   was this emergent threat they kind of just looked at the ha ha here's this crazy phenomenon but
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:43.100]   Collins documentary into the storm Colin Hoback is incredible incredible for
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:48.940]   us everybody for a long time and in fact at the end of it it's a six-part documentary on HBO it's
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:56.620]   on HBO Max I recommend it if you have HBO Max at the end of it it's pretty clear that while the
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:03.020]   original Q we don't know who that was the one on the originally started the whole thing on 4chan
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:12.060]   kind of took off early on and it was taken over by eight chance new owners and the
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:18.380]   queue almost certainly all the queue drops from that point on were by I can't remember his name
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:25.580]   the son of the likely from Ron Watkins the son of Jim Watkins who is the owner of HBO in
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:30.860]   an H which rebranded as a cool yeah you feel like that's a reasonable conclusion that
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:38.140]   yeah yeah it's it is the conclusion most of us who cover this space think yeah but you never know
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:43.420]   with a documentary it's easy to it's easy to pick and choose but uh I'm actually glad to hear you
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:49.820]   say that and Frederick at first seemed to me a little bit sketchy he certainly he started eight
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:54.780]   Chan which was sketching in and of itself but actually comes off pretty sympathetic and it was
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:35:01.180]   virulently anti-q and anti-8chan and anti-walked he knew that the threats especially
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:08.220]   as violence started to happen and the shmash also just to just decide no because Dan kept saying
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:12.300]   it's not just about him that is one of the reasons why you know I joke about all the time I'm in a
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:17.900]   black box and I don't really talk about where I'm at um maybe five or six years ago I had somebody
[01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:24.380]   threaten me and it wasn't like I'm that big of a person but they knew enough about me but not
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:29.980]   enough to get to me and that's why I live the way that I live like it's very hard to get to me like
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:34.140]   I can show you my driver's license right now and you're still not going to get directly to me but
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:38.220]   even with that like teaching kids and things like that with the things that they post and
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:42.940]   they're sharing their locations everywhere like as much as I say we gave up privacy there are
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:48.140]   certain things that people don't think about trying to protect some layers of themselves
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:52.140]   that's a really good point. That opens for us intelligence. Oh I get exactly what you're talking
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:56.940]   about. I'm always I'm the guy who always says well what are the harms uh you know so some
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:03.020]   advertiser knows more about you uh you get ads that are targeted against you a big deal that's not
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:06.540]   a harm and then people say well what if insurance companies knew I said yeah but is that happening
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:10.540]   they know everything anyway but you make an act and then people say well what if the government
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:15.180]   turned out to be malicious and they have all this information okay maybe when that happens we'll
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:20.460]   start to worry but you make an excellent point these guys we don't know who the hell they are
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:25.260]   and they're terrifyingly scary and they're very willing to use whatever information they can get
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:30.300]   and apparently they're very good at getting information that's that's that's pretty scary.
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:34.300]   Do you think that that has something to do with why the Republican party is acting the way it's
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:42.860]   acting are they just afraid? Uh I will put it to you like this I the I talked to Fred I mean pretty
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:51.020]   pretty regularly through the process like for years um but I I talked to him on camera the last
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:58.300]   time in January and I just asked him this really simple uh set of questions about the future of
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:03.980]   this was just after the insurrection the the future of the Republican party when it comes to
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:09.180]   and I'm not a partisan I'm not a Democrat or Republican but when it comes to these extremist
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:17.660]   factions which are undeniable um and what Fred told me is that this is
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:27.660]   I mean you can watch his interview but this is not QAnon is irrelevant they will evolve and become
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:33.980]   something else but the elements that created QAnon is not going away and that they have not
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:38.860]   just infiltrated the Republican party but they are components of it in large part because of
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:45.660]   disinformation and misinformation um so some of QAnon and I know some of these people uh they've
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:50.460]   been hoodwinked these are just they're true believers but they're hoodwinked uh it sounds like though
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:57.660]   they're malicious actors who are using this for other reasons is there are people who understand
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:02.220]   how to how to exploit these groups uh one of the people that shows up in the documentary somebody
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:08.220]   you covered is the founder of anonymous uh yeah Aubrey and Aubrey says this is the playbook that
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:16.300]   we invented it now being it is isn't it it is now being misused like trolling for the I mean like
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:22.460]   hyper trolling meta trolling um it's very interesting and I mean we've seen the evolution in the
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:28.060]   expression of QAnon and people like Marka Dredeiler Green um and again I'm not a partisan but I I mean
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:33.100]   the rhetoric and behavior that she uses and she is I mean she posted a number of videos that were
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:39.820]   pro Q um well if nothing else it shows people you can get away with this you can get away with the
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:45.420]   big lie and there is a there is a playbook that you can follow and you know you know what
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.940]   stop people before is well I don't know could I get away with this would I go to jail is this
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:55.260]   gonna be a problem and uh apparently not so people who have this bent can now say ah there's a playbook
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:39:01.900]   here's how here's how you can play the public control them make money uh and and pursue a big lie
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:09.660]   post truth post truth it's very scary uh to me and yes that look this is the show gets political
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:14.780]   from time to time but this is more than politics this is about technology and about how it is being
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:20.300]   used it's what we began the show with is this whole issue of social and now I have to say given
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:28.300]   what you said and what Owen has said um you know I'm very open you know people I the other day I
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:32.380]   posted a picture that my home address on it for crying out loud and some very nice people in the
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:37.980]   in the discord took it down before anybody saw it I hope because I've you know it's all public
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:42.060]   record people I figure people know that stuff but I think maybe it's smart oh and I'm gonna need some
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:49.740]   uh uh opsec training from you I can I can hook up real quick yeah yeah I learned I learned
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:55.180]   most of my to live from um elder black folk you know keep stuff in your baby name you know I mean
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:59.660]   you got stuff in your brother's name wow my name you know I mean you got to find me you got
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:03.740]   it's too late for me yeah because when you buy a home it's public record
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:10.220]   you're voting you're voting and everybody you contribute to is public record and includes
[01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:15.340]   addresses and phone numbers it's not hard to find that out and technology's made it much much
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:20.140]   easier you used to you had to go to the county seat and ask the clerk the corporation isn't buying
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:24.540]   your house for your collio I gotta start doing that we're we aren't using the corporate company
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:29.500]   to buy the house I gotta start doing that I'm afraid not writing this stuff off what are we doing
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:37.340]   ugly I'm not I'm not smart about this stuff I just I'm broke down here I don't own nothing
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:42.220]   ain't nothing in my name okay they would have to they got to hit my LLC they want to take something
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:46.940]   from me but it's interesting it's interesting because you've learned from elders in the black
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:51.340]   community because this has been a problem if you're black has been a problem for 400 years
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:57.740]   so it's interesting that different mindsets but you know it is a different mindset but it's
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:03.180]   but it's not so far fetched right oh it is definitely not and again when I would hear my
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:07.500]   grandmother talk about things in her time period they're for totally different reasons of why they
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:12.220]   moved from Alabama up here and they brought the whole family because they had to escape you know
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:16.860]   even though people like I love people I tell me that time you weren't slavery there's like again
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:21.020]   yeah slavery was a long time ago but people were still very badly mistreated in certain parts of
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:26.300]   this country still are still are still are gonna make yeah I'm trying I'm this America got my
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:30.460]   bootstraps pull them up I'm not going pretty good I'm not trying to cry about everything but I mean
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:34.380]   like there is a definitely different kind of mentality on protecting yourself and your loved
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:40.220]   ones from some maybe threat changing maybe you want to turn off that Amazon sidewalk feature on your
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:47.980]   Echo it launches June 8th by the way it's it's it's been present in Echo devices for some time
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:53.660]   but starting at June 8th Echo speakers and ring gadgets will be able to connect with devices
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:59.340]   outside your house including other people's devices including tile trackers and now I'm scared I wasn't
[01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:05.100]   scared when I began the show now I'm worried you're welcome you you've got a red button now
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:11.580]   what are you afraid of nobody what would anybody want to harm a nice little clown like me
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:18.220]   Uncle Leo because because I'm looking at the clock go ahead and tell the people about some
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:23.420]   deltay oh you're right you're so smart you know I want to tell you about WWT and del technologies
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:29.500]   thank you all in JJ Stone our show today brought to you by worldwide technology and del technologies
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:35.020]   WWT we've talked about them before I love these guys went out and visited them last March our last
[01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:41.820]   trip before the pandemic in St. Louis we saw the amazing advanced technology center
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:47.180]   WWT has for decades been at the forefront of technology working with clients all over the world
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:52.220]   to transform their businesses they are the kings the experts in enterprise technology and at the
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:58.940]   heart of all that lies the ATC the Advanced Technology Center it's it's WWT's research and testing lab
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:05.660]   that brings together technologies from leading OEMs more than half a billion dollars in equipment
[01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:12.460]   in the lab you know it used to be that magazines would do this PC magazine used to have this amazing
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:19.020]   testing lab nothing like the ATC but nobody does this anymore except I'm thrilled to see
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:24.700]   WWT doing it when we visited the lab it blew me away it's it's spread out over several buildings
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:31.260]   it's miles of racks with some of the most amazing stuff in there including some beautiful del power
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:37.180]   stores it's really interesting the stuff that's designed for racks actually looks spectacular
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:44.300]   in the ATC you'll find hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs that you can do like dels vx
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:52.220]   rail cyber recover solutions dels power store the unity power max data protection central i d p a
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:58.380]   the newest advances in primary storage these labs are for you of course it started with
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:05.180]   WWT's engineers they would use them for proof of concept to spin up pilots give customers a chance
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:09.980]   to select the best solutions make sure it could integrate with existing solutions which really
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:15.340]   helped cut you know the evaluation time for months to weeks but now these labs are available to
[01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:21.820]   everybody in the WWT community other labs in the ATC represent the newest advances in things like
[01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:26.220]   things you want to know about for your business like multi-cloud architecture and security and
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:34.380]   networking primary and secondary storage data analytics ai devops all this stuff that is
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:40.460]   transforming business the ATC is there for you it's they call it lab as a service
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:45.420]   you could test out products and solutions before you go to market it's not just labs you can
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:50.940]   access technical articles get expert insights there's demonstration videos white papers
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:55.900]   so many tools to help you stay up to date with the latest technologies and it is a physical
[01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:59.980]   lab space in St. Louis but you don't have to go to St. Louis i would recommend it if you get the
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:06.300]   chance i can't wait to go back but but you can also do it online because it's a lab as a service
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:11.580]   they've virtualized it members of the ATC platform can access these resources anywhere in the world

[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:30.220]   Tuesday i think is going to be a big day for google google took a nap in 2020 they didn't even bother
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:36.460]   doing google i/o it's too much too much trouble but they're going to do a google i/o the keynote is
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:41.340]   Tuesday we will be covering it will be streaming it live Jason howl will join me what is that 10 a.m
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:49.100]   john pacific pardon me and jeff Jarvis oh good that's great Jason howl jeff Jarvis and i
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:56.220]   will be sitting at this table watching the keynote with you 10 a.m pacific that's 1 p.m eastern time
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:00.140]   1700 UTC you can watch live at twit.tv/live
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:05.820]   sono perch i kind of telegraphed this in the analyst call a couple of weeks ago he said we've
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:10.460]   got a lot of interesting that we've got we've got some big stuff to talk about i think the nap time
[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:16.300]   is over for google and i'm very curious one of the things that's starting to leak now
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:22.540]   normally they announced new pixel phones in the fall pixel five i didn't even bother
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:29.020]   because it was no it was hardly any change this one's going to be a bit different we're already
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:37.740]   seeing design leaks john prosser who is pretty good on these leaked a design on his youtube channel
[01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:44.780]   front page tech he says these are the pixel six and the pixel six pro these are renderings
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:52.060]   the front screen will go all i mean it is full screen a very small hole punch for the camera
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:57.100]   the front camera very tiny bezels there is an in-display fingerprint reader note
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:48:02.300]   it's not the first we've seen i mean others have done this but uh be interested to see how google
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:09.820]   implements it the back is a two-tone camera module is the full width it actually is the bar and by
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:17.100]   the way it's not a camera bump anymore it's a camera bumper that is a is a big raised bar on the back
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:24.220]   uh perhaps that's a fall flaw in the rendering we'll have to see and the pixel pro six
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:31.900]   includes a third rear camera not found on the pixel six so it'll be interesting to see new
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:39.100]   capabilities google took some time off 2020 the other thing we know is google's going to do a
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:42.140]   custom system on a chip including custom processor
[01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:51.100]   uh you you mentioned that weslier uh what is this google looking at what apple's done and saying
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:49:01.340]   hey we should do that too yes and also um not to not quelcom quelcom but they have their leaps have
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:07.900]   becoming shorter and shorter as they improved and i'm not sure if you remember um i have a pixel
[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:14.460]   too i mentioned this in all out holy cow right but uh a pixel two yes but that's when they have the
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:20.700]   video process sorry the image processor their custom silicon and that phone um to help push
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:27.180]   image capture to the next level and now it's kind of like so that was the big jump roll that into
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:33.820]   pixel four and five were pretty much the same as the pixel two to me yes uh the abad soli to the
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:40.700]   pixel four yeah and so this is something that could actually help them leap into the next level of
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:45.100]   whatever they want to optimize it you mentioned the additional camera so hopefully they're doing
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:51.900]   something with that that optimizes it but uh the just from the design it looks better than it's
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:57.260]   pretty any other phone yeah they're not not saying it looks like a lot better but it looks different
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:50:02.140]   enough that you can say oh i know what that phone is right all the previous pixels were kind of like
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:06.300]   they kind of blended in especially through a case on it this is something even with a case
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:12.860]   it'll stand out um which in itself regardless of what they're doing inside is exciting for the pixel
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:21.340]   line it feels like um not only google taking nap 2020 and you can explain that with covid okay
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:25.900]   fine although apple certainly did not microsoft certainly did not but google seems to
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:34.380]   take in that time to to rest but it also seems like uh they they lost the guy who was behind their
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:39.900]   really innovative cameras they were the best cameras out there the pixel though seems to have
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:46.220]   also lost its way at first it was a low cost reference design for people who wanted to get the
[01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:52.940]   best android experience then they then they started charging flagship prices for it uh then
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:57.580]   it started becoming oh that's the one with the best camera but then they rested on those laurels
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:02.540]   it seems to have really lost its way so it would this would be a good time for google to sit up and say
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:11.500]   uh okay we found our mo we found the mojo it was in center pachys a back uh room and we're
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:17.900]   gonna bring it out again i want them to do that we need the competition yeah and they need that
[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:22.940]   mentality yeah they need that microsoft mentality too of like taking the loss to get in people's
[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:28.060]   hands it's one of those weird things where you have a lower end phone not lower end you have a
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:33.980]   lower cost phone and i knew so many people they're like that must be like a cheap phone because i'm
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:39.820]   paying $1,200 for a samsung i'm paying $1,200 for an iphone why why is this phone only $700
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:44.140]   whatever it's lacking i don't want that like that's a general concept of average people
[01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:48.220]   that when you talk to them about oh have you looked at this google phone and they're like no because
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:52.460]   they think it's cheap but then they try to raise the price and it's like okay well now you got these
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:56.300]   two tears now you got too many options for somebody who's not market share dominant
[01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:03.020]   samsung can afford to have an s plus an s light an s gigabit an s tablet s note like they can afford
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:09.980]   that leisure google cannot google needs to really hunker down and focus and produce a great phone again
[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:21.420]   yeah yeah right i agree with you dude unfortunately if it even if it is good they also don't have
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:28.460]   a track record of continued success so this also could be a blip where it is good but that doesn't
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:34.460]   mean it's a trend to unwind hopefully apple's threatening these people hopefully like what i
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:39.420]   said earlier i just assume that all these companies are talking to each other trying to form a
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:44.140]   Voltron like they need like look we need to come together and have some semblance of fight to put
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:50.060]   up against what apple's doing because apple is creating a great wall that is impenetrable and
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:55.100]   all these other companies are scrambling you better make your own chips you better have your own sauce
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:53:00.060]   that sauce better be good you better consistently serve that sauce to try and climb out of this hole
[01:53:00.060 --> 01:53:05.340]   that apple has put everybody else in because it's it's just it's dangerous right now apple apple is
[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:11.020]   smooth sailing with its mobility and that you know the computer's not so much you're microsoft
[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:16.460]   i built a pc my pc is a bulb and i got this little m1 you know i mean this little there's no
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:22.060]   mac mini and they try to pull me back in the game you know i mean because i i i can i say this i
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:27.020]   try to get me back and i don't i don't want to say i was i'm very excited about the m1 i'm very
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:31.180]   excited about apple doing so in silicon i feel like intel is kind of it's talking about taking the big
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:37.660]   sleep until i've done anything in years but has apple really in its early days so you know maybe
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:42.540]   they will but has apple really done anything besides say we got our own silicon i mean they
[01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:47.820]   haven't really done anything that takes advantage of this i feel like part of the problem is everything
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:55.100]   we've got right now is is really faster than we need it's fine your pixel two is fine it's five
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:54:00.460]   years old but it's fine i'll tell you from my point of view because i can't well i got our six back
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:07.100]   there but i'm shooting on my r5 my camera five it shoots 8k out again i love AMD thread ripper
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:12.140]   i've gotten the video card in here i've got 16 gigabit like i'm pretty max i got 120 gigs of
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:17.900]   ramen this thing and guess what for 8k video i still have to make proxies of this thing chugs
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:24.780]   along and it sounds like a jet engine with this mac mini by itself using apple software i can
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:31.740]   actually import 8k raw video and it's not smooth but it works and i don't have to do anything to
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:38.140]   chop it up and use it to work like that's power for my case use um for somebody even my r6 the
[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:43.660]   the files are so large my pc you have to do certain things to make it run right but whatever they've
[01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:48.220]   got going on all this hand shaking that they're doing inside this little thing it even works on
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:52.940]   my ipad better than it does on my computer now i just don't edit it on my computer i i know the
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:57.100]   workarounds i know how to do it i know how to get the job done but this little thing has impressed
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:04.700]   me with just my case use of that like i just take this raw footage out that's huge and it just works
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:09.500]   on this machine i don't have to do anything i could just works so they're doing something quiet and
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:17.660]   yes it's not hot like my intel mac was you could cook an egg on it it was no i'm not believe me i was
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:22.140]   excited and i still am about the m1 and uh and what apple will do with this going forward
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:28.380]   but it does but but look at the ipad it's so overpowered as an example they're putting the m1
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:34.220]   in the new ipad with 60 gigs of ram they've never had more than six with a two terabyte storage
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:40.380]   device that's a desktop computer added edit by the way a desktop price you got a desktop in your
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:45.500]   handle but it's running ipad o s but it's but it's but it's like i don't think people are going to get
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:51.660]   the benefit of it i don't know that doesn't and what are they doing what are you i mean beside a k
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:57.660]   video okay good i'm just i'm just saying using the ipad edit videos sometimes too and edit photos
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:01.900]   and things like that and now i got a thing with 50 megapixels like it's big they're big files
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:06.860]   and certain things that you're doing them okay you don't understand the tiktok social media world
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:12.140]   of today i don't you're right ipad pro with a cell phone in there and guess what you're going to
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:17.660]   be the sliggers sexy but if you are on the block but you are niktok doesn't display a k does it
[01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:24.460]   huh tiktok doesn't display a k so why are you working in a k listen just don't listen to what i'm
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:33.020]   saying follow what i'm doing baby i can make two four k i can make 10 10 80 12 80 i can crop that
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:38.380]   zoom in to make my eye still looks over 80 i'm a Leo you understand in a way the world where we
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:43.900]   are snap tab and we are tiktok we are you two been out here in these streets on the lio and let me
[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:49.260]   tell you they're main streets but i don't know ipad pro and a cellular device and they're at
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:54.140]   all those devices think that you're on a phone i i some people in there look like they work for
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:57:02.060]   cmbc and cnn okay i hear what ipad pro i agree i'm just looking at wesley's video frankly and wesley
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:09.340]   is higher res than i am yeah which is nuts what are you using for your camera there it's
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:17.020]   you laugh it's all about lighting uh i'm using a logitech uh you're kidding c9 22 those are good
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:24.140]   cameras but yeah it looks like a dsl it looks like he's using your r5 um yeah nope so it's lighting
[01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:29.820]   it's lighting it's that it's them good jeans too okay it's them good jeans don't hurt they don't hurt
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:34.220]   i don't like i don't like that for damn but we doing all right these streets you know what i'm saying
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:40.220]   we doing all right this is the best looking panel we've ever had i have to say never lied
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:50.220]   oh my god anyway i'm excited about tuesday uh you look if you're gonna have walled gardens you
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:54.860]   want everybody competing vigorously at least i mean i'd like to see everything be open that's
[01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:59.100]   not gonna happen so at least you want everybody competing vigorously you don't the worst kind of
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:05.420]   walled garden would be what microsoft had in the 90s which is a 100 dominant walled garden then
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:11.100]   you're then that's bad because this just be google picking up where intel um and qualcom have
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:17.580]   kind of stumbled i mean they just i think that was wesley's point yeah yeah right yeah uh the
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:23.180]   incumbents uh talk about sleepy they were resting on their laurels they you know it's always it's
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:29.820]   the innovators dilemma intel is doing really well making you know integrated chips and systems
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:34.460]   integrating their business making their own stuff all of this stuff they got very invested
[01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:38.700]   and it's been billions of dollars on fabs and then it turned out that wasn't the way to do it
[01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:45.180]   it the the fabulous guys came along like qualcom and arm and it's like whoops but we've put so much
[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:50.540]   money into it we can't pivot and that's the problem right in fact in a way that's that's uh why
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:56.700]   microsoft's kind of impressive because the they're one of the very few companies that that made the
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:05.820]   pivot and made it work in my opinion it's the lack of creativity in these companies is that what it
[01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:12.860]   is or just the lack of willingness to undermine their uh incumbent business you if you're living
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:18.300]   you know on selling a certain product it's hard to say well we're gonna do something that's where
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:21.900]   apples been pretty good i don't know if they're still good at it but but if they don't do it
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:26.860]   someone else will right that's true um one thing that i'm looking for like i brought this up before
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:35.100]   on all about android is will they talk about ai and ethics and because that is in the news they will
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:40.620]   and that is a brain drain they will that they that they have precipitated on themselves oh you're
[01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:47.260]   talking about their ai ethics committee and of course they lost uh tim re tim re jebrew and lost
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:53.260]   they got rid of got rid of fired yeah uh oh that's a very good point that's actually been a real
[01:59:53.260 --> 02:00:00.940]   problem in fact uh another uh person from their uh ai divisions has gone to apple now he quit because
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:07.260]   of the firing of tim re tim re tim re and now they're gonna try that like they said they're gonna
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:12.860]   double their ai ethics team oh it's interesting how are they gonna find people who wants to work
[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:17.820]   for them they will not get the best of the best when they have this reputation and which means that
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:23.420]   it's gonna cause some some you know makeup and some slowdown they need to convince people that they
[02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:28.860]   that they made them that they understand they made a big mistake and that and if we're gonna have
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:33.500]   an ai ethics team we've got to give them independence and we can't say oh we don't like what you're
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:38.460]   saying so bye bye that's not gonna work it's not gonna work but they've already doubled down
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:45.260]   and they've avoid talking about it and so there there's a big stage coming up on Tuesday and if they
[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:50.780]   do it again then i mean that will be interesting and i bet they're gonna just talk about the
[02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:56.940]   amazon is i'm sorry the google assistant too and hype that up at how great it is and how can you
[02:00:56.940 --> 02:01:03.100]   not mention this big elephant in the room i think the silence will be deafening unless they find a
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:23.980]   way to address it yeah sammy benjio left because of the firing of margar mitchell and tim nek
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:36.620]   i would love for him to say that but he's not because of probably legal liabilities for the company
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:42.220]   oh yeah that's too bad that i brought this up before that they should just bite the bullet yes
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:47.340]   they get sued pay the fine they get sued all the time and they find why not do you admit it this reason
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:57.500]   yeah and be able to resurrect some of this nascent talent that that they had before and just bring
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:03.420]   those bringing people back and make it welcoming and really make amends in the community but my
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:09.260]   guess is they say the same thing the boilerplate like we we are reinvesting we're doubling down
[02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:16.860]   we're sick of that a lot you know like very that mealy mouth stuff yes and we are committed to this
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:21.900]   all that stuff that just doesn't really mean hillabean's you know mike elgens said something
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:25.420]   when he was on twitter a few months ago that actually shocked me but then after i thought
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:28.860]   about it i said you know what he's right he said sinner pachias the worst
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:35.100]   ceo in silicon valley of any big tech company and i have to say since larry page
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:42.540]   and sergebrin left i mean even you know i guess you could even say since
[02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:51.260]   what's his name left eric schmitt google has not been performing well they've really had trouble
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:57.100]   they've canceled a lot of projects they they haven't shown a exciting new study shown stuff
[02:02:57.100 --> 02:03:02.380]   like that google duplex that they've never shipped remember that they showed the google buds
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:07.340]   with a simultaneous translation and this was at a google i know three years ago yeah where they at
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:13.180]   i need that that's uh that was so legit like i need that was cool but they never they couldn't do it
[02:03:13.180 --> 02:03:17.020]   i bought them don't stick with anything they don't stick with anything like i said
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:20.860]   i said i mentioned with the pixel it might be a good version but they don't have a good track
[02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:24.140]   right yeah and that you have to see lay that as a new
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:28.620]   like you have to say that's a new pet chai's fault don't you yeah yeah they need to iterate they
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:32.780]   need to say okay we listen to you and this is it's kind of like the same thing with this AI
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:38.140]   ethics they are not listening to everyone yelling at them and they think that they have all the
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:44.300]   right answers and that is their like stand there and inventing make that mistake in inflatable
[02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:47.660]   privacy pod pillows that look like you're getting eaten by a
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:53.180]   bug Wesley it's fascinating that thing you got a kickster ball yeah
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:04:00.860]   no that's not the thing i got a kickster but if i could buy it on kickster it i would go
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:04.940]   i'm talking about did you see that we talked about it last week the new york times article where
[02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:09.820]   these new google offices where if you want privacy i guess you press a button
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:16.540]   and this robot comes around and then spreads out and slowly inflates and i mean really slowly like
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:23.660]   it looks like it takes about ten minutes it flakes this luminescent pillow around you so nobody can
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:28.540]   see what you're doing that's where google's putting all its energies not a good idea i'm sorry
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:36.620]   Dan go ahead no i just remarked that it's they have not only made this mistake but it is they've
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:42.940]   been deaf for so long yeah well and apple you know this is a problem with big companies these days
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:49.740]   is very hard apple hired a guy named Antonio Garcia Martinez former facebook employee if you read
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:57.580]   his book chaos monkeys which apparently nobody at apple did he would have said maybe we shouldn't
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:02.060]   hire this guy he's been fired employees circulated a petition on wednesday saying
[02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:12.380]   you got some explaining to apple explain why you hired this guy he uh because he has made
[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:18.460]   statements that are his published views on women and people are color are reprehensible
[02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:24.620]   apparently you didn't know that he described women in the bay area as soft and weak this is in
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:29.660]   the book chaos monkeys which i tried to read and threw across the room after a couple of chapters
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:35.820]   he said women in the bay area are soft and weak costed and naive despite their claims of
[02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:43.340]   worldliness and generally full of poop that's not a nice thing to say in a book it was a terrible book
[02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:49.260]   um and apparently apple didn't read the book they have now fired him
[02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:53.740]   terminated with extreme prejudice
[02:05:55.420 --> 02:06:01.900]   uh he he he tweeted about i have thus far far maintained my silence in the apple situation
[02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:06.220]   as i've sought to settle things immickably with a company that i admired which i had
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:11.900]   hoped to build the future of ads privacy as they however are not maintaining their silence in the
[02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:20.860]   matter neither shall i i upended my life for apple i sold my home shut down any public media presence
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:23.020]   apple knew about my book
[02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:32.540]   companies will do this all the time where they will take the person they deem is worthy or has a
[02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:39.740]   good resume without worrying who they've hurt and harmed look at the the free software foundation and
[02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:47.740]   rms i mean that is like a bonfire going on and they keep saying like well we think this value in this
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:54.700]   value in this person um and so uh i plot apple in this case of like listening to their employees
[02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:59.660]   bringing this to their attention but the lack of due diligence is something that really they
[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:06.140]   should look at and promise that nothing like this will ever happen but continuously people are not
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:13.180]   looking at the harms people due to these marginalized or underestimated communities when they are
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:19.900]   looking to hire folks and until that's fixed we're going to still see these uh stories you don't think
[02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:26.700]   it's apple saying oh uh believing in redemption and oh the god you know he says apple was well
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:31.740]   aware of my writing before hiring me my references were questioned extensively about my best-selling
[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:39.420]   book and my real professional persona rather than the literary one um how diverse was this team that
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:45.820]   looked at this yeah i don't see anything offensive by this yeah you know berry women are uh cauceted
[02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:53.020]   yeah or exactly yeah it can't be companies especially apple but companies in general they just can't
[02:07:53.020 --> 02:08:01.260]   do that anymore um they just i mean i believe in redemption and forgiveness but uh there's some
[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:05.500]   things you just don't you know you could see how do the work you got to do the work yeah you don't get
[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:11.900]   forgiven unless you like apologize and change but if you are saying that lane and just pushing forward
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:17.580]   i don't think you deserve to keep going and you should not enable these people to amass more power
[02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:24.700]   and more influence yes look our business priorities do not uh optimize for forgiveness no good point
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:33.900]   um you know i must says first he said you can buy a tesla with bitcoin and then somebody pointed
[02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:38.460]   out that might not be the most environmentally friendly way to buy an electric vehicle so
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:43.820]   tesla has retracted that offer you can no longer buy a tesla with bitcoin
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:49.340]   um which seems sensible i wonder if you'll be able to buy it with dogecoin a little later on
[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:57.900]   elan seems to really be big on special question yes about this so do batteries come from flowers
[02:08:57.900 --> 02:09:03.820]   and sunshine no like where where are batteries made from where are batteries mined from where
[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:10.380]   how do we get batteries are batteries made from ice water your your contention and i'm going to
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:17.740]   say this uh up front as as a proud owner not only of a tesla but now of a electric mustang maki
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:23.180]   and of a chevy bolt you're you're saying as many do that electric vehicles are not as green as they
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:29.820]   pretend to be they they are not it's not even a question you're the guy with gasoline in this
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:34.540]   trunk is that what you're saying let me tell you something i got gas in my pocket right now okay i
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:39.980]   i'm i'm a fossil fueler until i can afford to get the top of the line tesla actually i went for
[02:09:39.980 --> 02:09:44.060]   that cat life that electric cat life come out your boy gonna get one of those i'm gonna be plugging
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:49.180]   up i agree that you have to mind lithium to make these batteries but they have you ever seen a
[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:53.900]   mine lithium do you know what it looks like you know that strip mining i know i know i mean i
[02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:58.140]   but people most people haven't seen it you should bring that up on youtube or watch some videos of
[02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:04.060]   what it looks like when people mind for these things or like i said him saying this is just so
[02:10:04.060 --> 02:10:10.220]   outlandish and so ridiculous to me if that was the case you're he's one of the smartest rinses
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:13.980]   dumbest people on planet earth because you didn't just start mining bitcoin last week but you
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:19.260]   and made a little spewing all this spewing gasoline is not exact spewing gasoline at the
[02:10:19.260 --> 02:10:24.300]   back pipe of your car is not exactly a a good thing either oh and you would agree the same thing i
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:30.620]   told you earlier about america and fda baby we are killing ourselves slowly and everything we do
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:35.100]   and pointing out the one thing is bad why you're still doing something bad yourself doesn't make
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:41.740]   you a superhero it makes you a hypocrite i like my electric vehicle and they are working on king
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:48.300]   and they are working on recycling lithium batteries they are able to do that now i like my bitcoin
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:54.780]   juice you could like your electric and i could like my diesel currents okay okay what about what
[02:10:54.780 --> 02:11:04.060]   about the what about the uh private equity firm which bought a decommissioned power plant to mine
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:11.260]   bitcoin how about that i missed out on the investor call on that one i'm really upset that i didn't
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:17.580]   get put my money in this power plant 42 helium bots to come from China for me this power is a
[02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:24.940]   fossil fuel plant it uh burns uh burns uh liquid natural gas used to be a coal plant they at least
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:32.140]   they converted it from that uh has been that it no longer powers homes or businesses in uh in upstate
[02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:38.700]   new york right down the road from you dan patterson it uh it is now mining bitcoin the uh the uh
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:47.900]   private equity firm uh is uh let's see let me see their atlas holdings purchase the plant and is
[02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:54.940]   slowly repurposing it they have 18 000 specialized machines in the plant mining bitcoin they just
[02:11:54.940 --> 02:12:00.380]   got approval of their data center expansion they're going to add 10 500 more when the projects complete
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:07.020]   the miners will be using 79 percent of the plant's capacity 85 megawatts to mine bitcoin i'm sure
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:15.740]   it's economical but i don't know is it a good idea for the environment nothing we do is good for
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:23.500]   environments my point so it's all bad so we should just go away cal's are bad for the environment do
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:27.500]   you know what cal's do well you shouldn't eat me neither you're a good you're a vegetarian right
[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:33.660]   on those meatballs they're made out of tempeh again i i'm not a hypocrite i know that everything i do
[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:37.420]   that i can have a heart attack on this show right now if i'm out of brisket out of smoke
[02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:42.780]   in the last month i understand what i'm doing that's different brisket's okay brisket's good
[02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:49.580]   brisket's good for the environment you know musk can't say what he's saying shooting off rockets
[02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:54.780]   into the sky like it's just water vapor coming off of those jets and stuff like i mean no that's true
[02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:59.420]   i could go into the deepest hole with this dude what he's talking about when he's just manipulating
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:03.100]   markets but that's why he puts this stupid little dog in his face and i'm gonna put a stupid little
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:07.260]   coin on the moon because they're pumping off stuff and ripping people off with all kinds of things
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:12.300]   why am i gonna disagree i'm gonna be quiet talk to dad talk to dad dance dance dapper he looks good
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:17.820]   he sounds smart let's say something smart no no you're i i almost always oh and i look to you for
[02:13:17.820 --> 02:13:22.300]   leadership and there's your mistake that sounds funny but it's not i mean
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:30.540]   oh and has always been uh he's good isn't he always except i disagree with you about climate change
[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:36.060]   not everything you do it bad and we are in some stuffs worse than other stuff it's really important
[02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:40.460]   for for consumers not just businesses but it's important for business too but consumers need to
[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:46.140]   demonstrate that there is a market for cleaner technologies if we don't do this now we are
[02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:53.500]   really screwed and we can make changes that acknowledge the science of climate change and that
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:58.300]   we do have an impact and our behaviors both our business and our consumer behavior can change that
[02:13:58.300 --> 02:14:03.660]   oh and i sound like an asshole when i say that though i don't mean that no no again i believe
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:07.980]   in everything else you said i said i said this to you to ask a real question of things that
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:14.140]   bother me in the world right so let's just say um a cleaner a cleaning product a company has a
[02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:18.540]   product that's quote unquote bad for environment chemicals all kind of stuff they make a green
[02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:25.100]   product from plant-based everything's wholesome your dog could eat it everything else if they say
[02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:30.220]   it's just as good as their other product all i want to know is when are people going to say okay
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:36.380]   stop making that other thing with the chemicals that my dog can't accidentally sniff and just
[02:14:36.380 --> 02:14:39.260]   make the green product you've shown that you can make this green product and it's good why don't you
[02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:46.060]   feed your dog brisket i want i want those companies to just once they find that formula just stop
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:49.820]   selling the old stuff i don't even care if you rebrand and tell me it's the old stuff just make
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:55.100]   it better for me though like you said that's the thing where we need to make some kind of real
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:59.260]   chance because we do have options to help i'm i was gonna have hyperbolic but we do have things
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:02.300]   to go to plant it i just don't i don't know why we don't know why we don't know why we don't know
[02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:07.340]   things that we can do and just do them and admittedly we need power plants but should you
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:13.580]   recommission a decommissioned power plant burning fossil fuels just to mine bitcoin that seems like
[02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:20.380]   there are better things to do than that why aren't we using more waterways to create electricity
[02:15:20.380 --> 02:15:24.940]   well yeah i'm just saying i don't have a problem if you want to build a you know well i'm a damster
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:30.220]   another issue yeah capitalism yeah because you can i'm just saying okay you can say you can stand
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:35.100]   up and say there are some things not that are worse than others can't you or is everything awful yes

[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:11.500]   so i know it's the red bow tie i think they didn't like that our show today brought to you by express
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:20.380]   vpn have you ever wondered why internet access is cheaper these days it's because
[02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:27.100]   isp's like Comcast and atnt have another ways to make money not just off subscription fees
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:31.020]   they're making money from spying on your internet activities selling your history
[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:36.060]   and data to big tech companies or advertisers or marketers or whoever will buy
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:40.940]   we talked about privacy you know what a great way to protect your privacy is
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:51.020]   a virtual private network but but remember the vpn now assumes the role of your isp your vpn
[02:17:51.020 --> 02:17:55.900]   now knows everything you're doing so it's very important when you choose a vpn to hide your
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:02.300]   you know stuff from your internet service provider or your or your cell phone carrier or bad guys
[02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:08.140]   at the coffee shop when you're doing that you got to pick a vpn provider that respects you that
[02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:13.340]   protects your privacy that's express vpn and i don't i'm not just saying that even though i've
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:18.700]   been using them for years i know it because they've had third party audits they never log
[02:18:18.700 --> 02:18:24.140]   never log so your information is safe they even went so far as to create their own trusted
[02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:29.020]   server technology when you press the button and every express vpn app has this great big button
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:34.300]   you press it then suddenly now you're secure if they spin up a server they call it the trusted
[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:40.700]   server technology it's in ram only it's sandboxed it can't write to this even if it wanted to it
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:46.540]   cannot log and the minute you log off it's gone and so is every trace of your visit
[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:52.220]   express vpn is secure it works everywhere not just your phone your computer but even on
[02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:57.660]   smart tv's you can put express vpn on a router so that your whole family is protected the other
[02:18:57.660 --> 02:19:02.780]   thing i really like about them they invest in their infrastructure there are 160 express vpn
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:08.700]   servers in 94 countries all over the world and they always give them enough bandwidth so that it's
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:14.700]   fast that's important too you won't know you're using express vpn not because it's slow anyway
[02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:20.460]   you only know it because your privacy is protected it's simple to use open the app tap the button
[02:19:20.460 --> 02:19:26.860]   that's it it's safe it's secure it's private your data is your business protected with the only vpn

[02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:31.260]   subscription plan called twitter blue to include undue tweets how much would you pay to undo
[02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:39.020]   some of those tweets and some other features uh this this comes from a researcher jane
[02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:44.300]   mansion Wong who has apparently looked at the source or something she says twitter blue will
[02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:51.020]   be two ninety nine a month for now including paid featured like undue tweets and collections
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:56.140]   she's even got the screenshots save and organize your favorite tweets into collections so they're
[02:20:56.140 --> 02:21:02.540]   easy to find later uh you know this is twitter has been trying desperately to figure out a way to
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:08.060]   make money to somehow you know make make a living just in general can i tell you can i talk to
[02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:13.900]   jack real quick jack dorsey the ce of twitter jack you want oh one wants to say something go
[02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:19.580]   ahead so you just did this thing with twitter tips right okay all you have to do to make a
[02:21:19.580 --> 02:21:25.100]   bajillion dollars is go set yourself up with a only twitter okay go compete with only fans you
[02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:28.940]   don't have to take two ninety nine from you can give me all these features free if you just make
[02:21:28.940 --> 02:21:33.820]   a only twitter where your twitter is blocked off the twitter is like the only the last one of the
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:38.140]   last remaining social media networks where adult content can still be posted on that bad boy go
[02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:43.260]   ahead and put up only twitter and let people go get subscription based stuff and go see what they
[02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:47.500]   want to see over in the dark side of twitter and then go get that money and give me all this
[02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:51.420]   blue stuff free because i need to delete a whole bunch of tweets because i can't spell i have read
[02:21:51.420 --> 02:21:56.380]   right and i'm typing fast the same way i'm talking on this show so go ahead and just start up only
[02:21:56.380 --> 02:21:59.980]   tweets and everybody gets all the good stuff for free because you're gonna make a bajillion
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:05.740]   dollars next quarter semi-my two percent advisory fee cut i appreciate your jack that's how you get
[02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:09.180]   money that's all they got to do have you seen the tip jar?
[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:17.580]   he's gonna have some cash app some Venmo i mean apple energy but he's doing improv he's doing
[02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:24.300]   yes and so yeah expect that to come but i i think the subscriptions also come yes yes what i'm gonna
[02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:31.260]   say is this article is suspect i don't necessarily trust it because twitter has had collections for
[02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:37.660]   years and it's been free so um calling it like a actual feature makes me wonder the validity of
[02:22:37.660 --> 02:22:43.580]   this article interesting although i think twitter has i think dorsey has even said they're looking
[02:22:43.580 --> 02:22:48.780]   at subscription possibly yeah but they are still figuring out i don't ever on spaces they're like
[02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:53.180]   how do you want us to monetize this they're like asking people yeah that you don't ask people unless
[02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:57.900]   you you're you're having nothing you don't know what you got i get nothing with the acquisition of
[02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:03.900]   scroll though i see that as like if they do like uh kind of like amazon prime will like bundle all
[02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:09.900]   that into the description fee yes please thank you i hope that they do that with verification and
[02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:15.420]   allow me to take money i would definitely pay the three dollars to to get twitter blue or whatever
[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:22.220]   they want to call it breaking news thanks to you wesley just came across the wire aka discord
[02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:31.980]   bill gates reportedly left microsoft's board amid probe into relationship with stafir of course uh
[02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:35.900]   billin malinda gates according to wall street journal have been negotiating a divorce settlement
[02:23:35.900 --> 02:23:44.380]   since 2019 that divorce became public just last week um the wall street journal implied that the
[02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:49.420]   problem was they didn't say it outright but they implied the problem was bill gates relationship
[02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:55.980]   with jeffrey epsstein that uh malinda gates who's an advocate for women's rights and protection of
[02:23:55.980 --> 02:24:02.540]   young women um was unhappy about gates going to epsstein for money for the bill and malinda gates
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:07.980]   foundation wall street journal thought that might have been the problem now thanks to this story
[02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:13.500]   from cnet there may be more bill gates left microsoft's board last year after fellow board
[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:18.540]   members decided he should step down as they pursued an investigation into a prior relationship
[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:23.980]   the billionaire had with a female microsoft employee deemed inappropriate this is also oh sorry this
[02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:27.500]   is from the wall street journal this came out of and there's new york times is confirming that
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:35.180]   reporting as well okay i mean that's really gossip and probably not germane but i know uh our audiences
[02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:39.900]   storable people are a liability always good point
[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:44.140]   good point the problem is so many people are horrible
[02:24:44.140 --> 02:24:49.100]   you should hire wester so many nice people so nice
[02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:55.340]   there's a lot of great people out there so good hire nice people elbow and
[02:24:55.340 --> 02:25:01.660]   yeah the horrible you know what this is the motto of this show the horrible people elbow out the
[02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:10.300]   nice people everywhere i mean that's didn't alan say something about capitalism a lot but yeah i
[02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:14.700]   might have something to do with that uh i try not to keep ranting on the same things but it's
[02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:21.580]   it's really bad it's horrible because even you know your best laid efforts in certain positions of
[02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:27.260]   power you know i have a lot of friends that are cops and they talk about how people they work with
[02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:31.740]   work good and then they get corrupted by seeing a lot of bad and then they change and then
[02:25:31.740 --> 02:25:35.740]   they view people in a different way i mean so many people start off with good intentions
[02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:41.020]   and are corrupted by money power life whatever i mean we're only human beings like i said we're
[02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:44.860]   the best thing in the world we're the worst thing for the world yeah same time that's so that's the
[02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:51.340]   story morning glory this is yep humans i don't even know just more than it's i'm gonna just interject
[02:25:51.340 --> 02:25:56.780]   it's a little bit more than capitalism because if you look just straight up capitalism like vce money
[02:25:56.780 --> 02:26:03.900]   kind of capitalism uh minority owned businesses bringing more revenue are more successful but yes
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:08.860]   get to get just a fraction of the money yeah there you go if it was just purely capture capitalism
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:14.060]   then we would not be doing this it's ingrained in trench power that is and not going to let it go
[02:26:14.060 --> 02:26:22.220]   you know who gets the job done immigrants yeah it's good investment yep yep but and as soon as they
[02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:26.460]   find out they can they can buy the minority stake in something they will buy it and take it over and
[02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:32.140]   run it into the ground so yeah you're right it's a balancing act it's all it's all so here's another
[02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:37.260]   example of horrible behavior on friday the new york times briefly mentioned the president biden
[02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:42.700]   sent his grandchildren money on venmo which if you work for buzzfeed news is a red flag they
[02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:48.060]   immediately searched for the president's account and found it they mapped out
[02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:54.860]   a social web that encompasses not only the first family but a wide network of people around them
[02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:58.780]   including the president's children grandchildren see your white house officials and all of their
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:05.020]   contacts on venmo now good news president biden or somebody around him was smart enough to say
[02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:10.540]   if you're going to use venmo that the fault is public it always shocks me when i launch venmo to see
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:14.380]   what my son's giving people money for him what my daughter's giving people money for
[02:27:14.380 --> 02:27:21.420]   but people i know are giving other people money for uh those are public by default so
[02:27:21.420 --> 02:27:26.140]   click the little lock and make your transactions private and at least the president's family's
[02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:31.260]   doing that and buzzfeed news has decided not to identify usernames
[02:27:33.260 --> 02:27:37.020]   after they reached out to the white house for uh comment all the friends on the president's
[02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:42.380]   venmo account were removed we're talking about that because you can hide transaction but you
[02:27:42.380 --> 02:27:47.420]   cannot hide your friends yeah you cannot hide your friends we were talking about doxing and
[02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:51.580]   do so really and this is i'm something i'm going to say it made me happy but i know it's not right
[02:27:51.580 --> 02:27:55.020]   but like we're mich McConnell voted against the stimulus and then they found out his
[02:27:55.020 --> 02:28:01.740]   venmo and it like 500 people just requesting 1200 dollars from him on themmo like that that
[02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:06.380]   immune that's funny yeah by friday night all the venmo accounts tied to the president and the first
[02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:11.660]   lady were no longer online okay if you're the president don't use venmo in fact if you want privacy
[02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:18.540]   don't use venmo damn Patterson you've you've taught dissidents and others i remember you were doing this
[02:28:19.180 --> 02:28:28.140]   uh how to protect themselves online did you did you mention venmo uh yeah in egypt in uh 2014
[02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:37.660]   no we didn't uh but there was an interesting story related to venmo and uh some of the people
[02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:42.780]   who were allegedly involved in the capital insurgency i follow account an account on twitter that
[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:49.660]   uh we chat a little bit on dm but they do really interesting stuff by pulling uh all public photos
[02:28:49.660 --> 02:28:54.940]   and then putting all photos into the cloud like tens of thousands of these pictures
[02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:59.980]   um and then running their own machine learning algorithm i think some of them are fairly
[02:28:59.980 --> 02:29:05.740]   young like just out of uh computer science school and running machine learning algorithms
[02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:11.420]   kind of track those people down and the connective tissue the connective social network was all
[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:16.780]   venmo they were able to look at the friends of friends using venmo and say okay this will validate
[02:29:16.780 --> 02:29:24.380]   this ml algorithm that we just ran on these photos anyway it it's no one data point by itself
[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:30.620]   is useful but when you put it all together it's amazing yeah right precisely yeah what you can
[02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:36.460]   figure out and if you're going to pay for sex don't do it on venmo that case uh if
[02:29:38.220 --> 02:29:41.980]   just you know what public figures probably shouldn't be using venmo i'm just saying
[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:47.740]   it's convenient you don't get on the cash apps get on the which is cash safe
[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:52.220]   cash app is better i can make my name scooby mcduggie i still need my cash oh okay
[02:29:52.220 --> 02:30:01.260]   cash dot me right that's uh that's uh stripe yeah right yeah is that right no square it's
[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:05.820]   come sorry square i was confused square and squared one i'm only said dorsey's company cash
[02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:10.940]   yeah jack dorsey uses cash dot me because he he runs it he runs the place
[02:30:10.940 --> 02:30:15.900]   twitter and cash app that's all we need that's all we need so it you think it's yeah it's from
[02:30:15.900 --> 02:30:19.900]   square you think it's which is jack dorsey's company you think it's safe it's more private

[02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:27.660]   we really appreciate it cbsn what it the it's not cbsn.com it's uh no it's just cbsnews.com
[02:33:27.660 --> 02:33:32.700]   it's on cbsnews and then there's a stream down below the app click live and it's live it is
[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:40.860]   effectively a 24 like we try not to be as like uh shouting heads as cable tv but it's a 24-hour
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:48.780]   news network so live news and is is it free to all is that support 100 free yep it's in peremont plus
[02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:57.740]   but it's also in the cbsnews app um or you just come to cbs.com/live um it's it is 100% free it's
[02:33:57.740 --> 02:34:02.620]   advertising supported it's hard to tell the difference between cbsn.com oh no it's good yeah
[02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:09.500]   it's just alive and we i mean i don't mean to disparage uh our friends who work at cable news
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:15.020]   networks but we really try not to do shouting talking heads it's thanks try to do it be as
[02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:22.540]   informative as possible i don't run the show no but uh that is the the uh the journalism culture at
[02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:29.740]   least is that like we do the news we don't do opinions or yelling we talked about the the hazard
[02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:37.740]   of facebook and and twitter and all of that social network stuff instagram tick-tock but actually i
[02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:44.220]   think there's an equal hazard with 24-hour uh cable news and um it'd be nice to get away from that
[02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:48.380]   a little bit i'm gonna start watching cbsn thank you dak side or something i appreciate it well thank
