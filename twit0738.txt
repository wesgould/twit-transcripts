[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.760]   and talk about the week's tech news. No I'm kidding. In fact Micah you've been booked for at least 15
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.800]   minutes. Ah yes I am. Micah Sergeant. Now of Twit very pleased to say formally iMOR. He at
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   joewa.coffee and which isn't really a job it's more of an adventure and then and now you're on iOS
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.560]   today in Tech News Weekly. Yeah good to have you. Thank you. And we're going to, Micah's going to
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.920]   have a big announcement a little later on in the show. Brand new show from Micah Sergeant. We're
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.520]   going to tell the world. Exciting. Also joining us from Motherboard. That's how they say it in
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.720]   Long Island. Motherboard and Vice Caroline Haskins. Hi Caroline. Hi. Good to see you. Welcome back.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:05.120]   How's things in Motherboard land? Good. Yeah things are good. We love the Motherboard. We do love
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.000]   the Motherboard. Consistently I think the best reporting especially on security topics
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.960]   anyway. I really love what you guys do so keep up the good work. Speaking of good work from
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.760]   Windows Central. Mr. Daniel Ribino he's the executive editor and apparently has more controllers
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:32.400]   than you and I. It's a weird action. That's like a quarter of it maybe. There's quite a few of them
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   out there. I don't even play Xbox that much at all at the time but I do like the controllers.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.680]   What can I say? Interesting hobby. Are you excited? I presume you're going to go to the
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.640]   Microsoft Surface event this Tuesday. Yep October 2nd. Basically what is turned out to be an
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.920]   annual Microsoft event now will be happening and we have a lot of reason to believe this will be
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.360]   the biggest event so there are since 2015. That's Wednesday. I apologize. Don't go there Tuesday.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.160]   I'll be there Tuesday but yeah definitely tune in on Wednesday for it. We'll be streamed live.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.840]   Yeah and we're going to get up early. I'm not going to be here because I'm going to Boston for
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.800]   a last pass event on Thursday but I don't know who's covering it. Are you doing it Micah? Yeah
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.840]   I'll be there. 7am right? 7am. Our time 10am in the east coast. It will be Micah and Ant Pruitt.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   And Ant. Oh nice. So what do we expect Daniel? This is where is it? Scentaurus is that where
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.360]   Scentaurus is going to debut? Yeah yeah Scentaurus the dual screen folding surface device that they've
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.480]   been working on for a few years and perhaps just as importantly we're probably going to see
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.960]   Windows Lite or Windows Core OS the brand new operating system designed for this new advanced
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   hardware that they're pushing with this device. Is it arm hardware or is it Intel hardware?
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.400]   This we have recently will be Intel based. That said we are I mean we'll talk about this in the
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.760]   Microsoft segment but we are expecting a arm surface device as well. Guess what this is the
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.960]   micro surface right now. If you want to go right into it. We don't do this stuff in order. What are
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.400]   you talking about? We do have a lot of stuff with Amazon there's Facebook but as long as we're
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.680]   talking let's talk about it. Alright so I gotta be careful here. I basically know everything that
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   they're going to talk about. Now do you know that because you have great leaks or you know that
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.080]   because they told you and non-disclosure do you? Great leaks Microsoft as far as I know doesn't do
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.480]   NDAs for this except if you're like probably the Verge has probably already got five hands on video
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.960]   shot because they always get preferential treatment. Most media outlets don't though so now this is
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.200]   an NDA. I also was offered not for Microsoft but from a well-known leaker pictures of something.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.760]   But I don't I don't I you know I feel skeasy looking at that stuff.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.000]   Yeah I mean I don't want to see it. Yeah from my perspective it makes my job easier knowing
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.640]   what's coming but I also don't want to ruin everything for people tuning in Wednesday especially
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.000]   because you know the service team puts a lot of effort into it and this day and age where literally
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.960]   everything is leaked now once in advance it doesn't matter if you're Apple if you're Google if you're
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.040]   you know it kind of ruins it so I want to keep some of this underlock but I'll just say that
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.960]   you know the leaks so far we've heard about from other sources too has been Surface Pro 7 so this
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.640]   is going to be this is a stable refresh right this is internalized hardware will be upgraded
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.000]   likely 10 gen Intel but the form factor in overall design is going to remain the same.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.880]   We are however expecting and I can confirm that it will switch from a mini display port to Type C.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.840]   Oh my god I'm going to faint because even Therat thought they would never do now when you say Type C
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.760]   is it thunderbolt or is that too much to ask? That I can't confirm that we don't know yet so a lot
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.600]   of the actual details about the hardware we don't know but I can tell you it's Type C now they also
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.360]   are keeping the surface connect port which I've heard it's probably not thunderbolt 3 and I'd
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.000]   rather tell people it's not because if it is then it's right yeah then you'd be happy. But even the
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.240]   Surface Go had a Type C port that you could use for USB 3.1 and charging as well as a surface
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.160]   connector so that would be a revelation it's really the thunderbolt 3 we're looking for.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.680]   Yeah I mean and I'm mixed on this stuff so I have a lot of devices that have thunderbolt 3 and a
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.400]   lot that just have Type C when most people are looking for is the Type C they want power delivery
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.880]   they want to be able to charge it they want to charge their devices they want to split out
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:52.160]   they want that functionality of a universal port thunderbolt 3 is cool but you're talking you know
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.400]   now for powering maybe 2 4k displays at 60 frames per second right that's cool but you're talking
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.040]   a small percentage of the population especially surface owners who are doing that. So being with
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:09.200]   I always hear the people chime in with what about an external GPU and I love eGPUs they're super cool
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.280]   but I mean come on most people are not investing in eGPUs eGPUs that said I mean I would never
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.760]   turned out a device that has thunderbolt 3 but because of keeping Surface Connect I'm not sure
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.080]   what the PCIe lanes how that balances out if they were able to do it or for what but let's assume
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.160]   it does the connect have that fast of an interface for data you can basically think of Surface Connect
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.040]   as they're thunderbolt 3 is pretty stupid so you're talking it uses its own amount of PCIe lanes
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.080]   but let's just assume it's just type C3.1 we'll find out there if it's thunderbolt 3 but I'm assuming not
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:54.400]   3 is a 40 gigabyte per second right and it is peer-to-peer USB is not peer-to-peer it's a
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:01.840]   control master you know server client and it is at max 3 1 I think is 10 gigabytes per second so
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.600]   it's a quarter of the speed it's not as flexible you can't do as much with it but you're right I
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.040]   think probably most users 10 gigabytes per second oh that's fine I'll take it
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:18.000]   yeah I think for most users they just want that types to universal port it'll be interesting to
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.240]   see how that goes so that's Surface Pro. Surface Pro 7 honestly is going to be probably the least
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.600]   interesting thing in this event because even though it's kind of their flagship product like
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.520]   you said we're not expecting a big redesign of that until 2020. And just to be for people
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.200]   I haven't seen it I think everybody has but it's a tablet that has one of those floppy Alcantara
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:47.280]   covered keyboard minimum key travel keyboards which I'm not a fan of. I actually really like
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.960]   the Surface Pro to keyboard I find typing on just especially because of the Mac keyboard I will
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.440]   bring that yeah it's really great when you eat like Cheetos and then rub it on the Alcantara
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.160]   just got like a nice patino you have a picture at Windows Central of Panos Panet showing up
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.680]   actually I remember this is from last year where he stole Paul Therat's laptop and I didn't give
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.760]   it back for a long time but interestingly if I blow up the picture I feel like this is this
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:22.000]   a Pruder film you see here you don't get a great typing experience you I don't think that's the
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.280]   full message they're trying to give out but I just want to point out that one and a half millimeters
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:34.320]   of key travel it's not great I think they're comparing it to a MacBook which is really awful
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.000]   yes because the that's the Surface laptop which actually I'm going to go on record and I've said
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.760]   this already that the Surface laptop's keyboard is and typing experience is still the best of any
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.440]   laptop or not better than Lenovo better than full travel yeah okay I mean I get Lenovo
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.400]   Lenovo is super good I love Lenovo and HP I think they they make both excellent keyboards and they're
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.320]   what's cool about them is they feel very different from each other it just depends what you prefer
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:07.200]   but in just terms of overall ergonomics because of the the way the palm rest works on the Surface
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.360]   laptop because of the aspect ratio it's just okay in my mind what the palm rest is covered with
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:20.800]   Alcantara but so that leads us nicely to this laptop three they have to have an option not to
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.440]   have Alcantara on my keyboard I like the laptop but I didn't want it really this is for sure
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.680]   yeah we're hearing for a Surface laptop three the 13 inch version will have optional Alcantara
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:41.280]   Caroline have you ever had a fabric covered wrist rest on your laptop no let me tell you
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   yes yes a long time ago you haven't lived until your wrists are floating on holocaust it's so soft
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:57.120]   it is a nice experience compared to metal it is what it's a little it's a little of a disconnect
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   from the hard-edged high-tech world yes you feel like you've got it like a grass covered laptop
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.720]   or something it's just like a little I think I'd like some turf on the laptop to buy some
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.760]   oh wait I prefer grass to Alcantara yeah there's also the and I don't know did you have you use a
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.000]   Surface laptop for a long period of time because I only use mine for a few months but I would
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.960]   imagine it doesn't wear that well so it depends the one you see that picks up dirt the most is the
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.480]   silver one with the gray Alcantara that one gets dirty if you don't mean it I like the burgundy
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.960]   and the cobalt or the black it definitely wears way better okay so it really depends on from that
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.920]   but yeah so what we're hearing is that there's going to be an option for Alcantara this time which
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:49.200]   means also in theory they could lower the price right so maybe it's 50 bucks cheaper with Alcantara
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.240]   I mean I'm paying for that yeah or being like yourself they could be just charging you more
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.160]   for the Alcantara and still make out but yeah Alcantara is a trademarked fabric right it's it's
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.320]   a proprietary right cloth so is now this the rumor is it's going to be AMD not Intel based on this
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.680]   new Surface laptop 3 is you notice I said the Alcantara is optional on the 13 inch
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.600]   and that's because we're also hearing there's going to be a 15 inch version announced
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.520]   and that 15 inch it's going to be likely the AMD version and the reason that makes sense is
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.760]   because that would have integrated Vega graphics and so Vega graphics doesn't quite get you gaming
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:35.520]   level Nvidia RTX or GTX it's not that but it's better than iRIS plus and a little bit better than
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.600]   the MX150s that are out there so it'll sit nicely in there in terms of video editing photo editing
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.320]   with a more powerful processor you know in that case so that's what we're hearing for that we don't
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.880]   have the specifics on the actual model numbers and all this but and there could be one rumor came
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.240]   out that there's actually a range of processors whether it's four six or eight core so pricing could
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.920]   start as low as a thousand dollars but goes all the way up to around twenty four hundred dollars
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.760]   and by gives them their flexibility you can basically buy which Surface laptop version suits your needs
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.800]   i feel like Surface laptop didn't get the credit it deserved it was just it was kind of
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.560]   it was nice and thin and pretty but it just wasn't didn't seem did it sell well do we know
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:24.080]   yeah i think it does do well i mean they've obviously are making a third generation and
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.560]   when i've talked to Surface team before their goal was always to get to version three version
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.200]   three is basically when it all comes together for them this is the one because yeah and so
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   they've learned from the market what people want for instance you know we're hearing alcatara is
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.480]   now optional that's from feedback right but yeah i think they have sold well the problem the
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.680]   Surface laptop is it's a traditional laptop so Surface has traditionally been associated with
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:53.840]   these new category devices and this is a straight up laptop but i would argue it's one of it has
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.720]   all the fundamentals about it makes it one of the best Windows laptops out there it's very
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:05.440]   elegant i think it's a nice elegant simple clean line laptop uh track that is good there's
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.040]   there's good display is good there's a rumor that it will not have surface connect but just USB
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:17.760]   C for charging on this one is that yeah i i don't know that for sure uh but it too will have some
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.880]   sort of type c port as well so many displays finally going what happened to the surface book
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.840]   we're due for a surface book three that's the one with a clothes pin hinge that you detach the top
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:34.320]   always not hearings yeah yeah there are some issues uh people have especially
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.600]   specifically right now they're trying to solve some issue with the GPU being disconnected uh but
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.440]   we're not hearing Surface Book 3 for this event uh which means the good news that that really
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   bothers you is Microsoft tends to do spring events too for Surface so it may not be as big
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.400]   for that we are thinking maybe just to refresh again internalized hardware 10-gen
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.360]   Intel's which at least at that level may aren't i don't think are out right now anyway so it'd be
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.000]   kind of premature for them to announce but you price which the RTX graphics and some minor
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.280]   improvements but yeah we're not expecting Surface Book 3 well they update the go
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.160]   go is not we're not expecting that for this event either so i i really had high hopes for the go i
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:23.200]   just it's a little it's nice and cute and small and it's like a it's like a surface uh pro but it's
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.800]   teeny and it's also kind of slow it's kind of not so this is the fundamental issue with it which
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.280]   is the processor now i would also say the bezels are a little bit thick and so they can fix that but
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.120]   we're also just about the surface go came out in july of last year so it's not that old of a device
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.680]   so it makes more sense i think for spring but that getting back to that processor issue so it
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.920]   uses Pentium gold which i remember when they told me i'm like what even i covered some of that
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:55.360]   Pentium gold i've never and it's such a it's a weird low end processor and the issue here is
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.760]   there's nothing i can't tell you like what else if they were updated tomorrow what would they
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:06.240]   replace that with i don't know there is no other Pentium gold as far as i know or some chip in that
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:12.320]   i remember intel made that for that device right they've actually made it kind of they had some
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:18.880]   Pentiums around and i think they're pulled up in a drawer spray paint them gold little rustoleum
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.200]   and you're good to go i think they were going to go a Qualcomm and intel is just like take these
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.440]   here we'll give you here and i think they cut them up probably a really good price on them
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:33.280]   they were better than the Qualcomm based arm processor windows issues and better than atom
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.320]   atom was the other thing that you know wasn't awful i just know i love it it was so cute it has
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:44.560]   LTE and it just was a very nice portable travel device but it just got a little too well so it's
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.800]   like they've got a really good lineup of things to announce surface studio or they they're not
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.840]   due for an update on that yet are they no no no surface studio but that leads you know so surface
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.120]   go probably next spring i do expect them to switch to Qualcomm probably at that point interest
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.520]   a listen tell has something else out there but we're hearing you know a seven cx the problem is
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.160]   they got to keep that price point right three ninety nine and so you can't put a core processor
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.560]   in there and sell core because they're too expensive so they got to find something that could
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.680]   meet their needs there and i think the Qualcomm may work better but we'll have to wait and see
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.240]   but the so this is now get to all right so what's new what why am i saying this event is going to
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:29.760]   be so big so we're like well besides that torus we're hearing a new surface think of a surface pro
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.440]   thinner lighter thinner bezels think of something that looks like an ipad pro
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.640]   but with a kickstand and uses the keyboard but it's going to be running a snapdragon
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:48.640]   eight cx so very interesting that's arm of course the eight cx's qual comes supposedly desktop class
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.360]   so these other devices were on the eight fifty five which really was underpowered for that
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:19:00.240]   the real benefit of anything running on arm though is battery life in synon this thing will
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.880]   never go to like a hibernation mode it'll be like the ipad where you just hit the power button it
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.240]   just pops on the screen always connected to lte of course really good battery life
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:17.920]   and i've seen this thing it looks really nice like it's it's and i expect this design
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:24.960]   is going to be what surface pro will turn into in 2020 but you want to see it for the qual conversion
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.320]   which if you think about it kind of makes sense maryk shop's going to you're going to see this
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.840]   thing and you're going to kind of want it because it's going to look really hot like i said think
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.120]   of an ipad pro but with the kickstand and the surface type of her and they have a new pen
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.120]   system i won't ruin the pen system here it's kind of cool but they're changing it up a little bit
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.960]   for this device and so you're going to see this thing you know you kind of want it and that's
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.920]   going to help i think push people to adopt it and then next year they'll probably update the pro
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:55.440]   version and pro users will get it so it's a good way i think to funnel people to arm which you know
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.080]   i think what's microsoft does this it will really say we're serious about arm and everyone should
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.960]   be like taking a look at this stuff now and so that device for me is really what i'm excited
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.280]   about because i actually do like using your arm devices napdragon 850 is actually okay
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:17.520]   the acx though is supposed to perform like an intel core i5 eighth generation it's supposed to
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:23.840]   be a really good processor so yeah um now of course intel is on 10th generation and i've used
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.880]   some of these and they're really good but core i5 for a lot of people misform factor i think is
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:36.400]   actually pretty ideal is this microsoft going after apple i think this is a little bit you know
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:42.320]   looking at the ipad pro uh and going against that arm is the future for a lot of mobile devices and
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.280]   they're moving towards there i think you're going to see this bifurcation of computing where you get
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.280]   to these light thin devices running armed and always on and instant and then you're going to have
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:57.520]   more heavy hitting devices that run bfur processors and have gpu's for people that need to do localize
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.040]   computing but as we move towards cloud computing stuff like you know windows 10 on arm and this
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.760]   goes into centaurus makes more sense because everything starts to be in the cloud like right
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.840]   now a lot of people want hardcore processors and gpu's for gaming but microsoft is about to start
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:20.480]   beta testing its xcloud service for doing game streaming so that solves that problem you think
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.320]   about you could actually have a thin client device and playing your xbox games without having to have
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.840]   expensive heavy hardware and so that's a really interesting transformation so i think that will
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.120]   be like the main announcements and then i think there will be this sort of you know one one more
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:43.200]   thing right and they're going to start to talk about the future of form factors and the next
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.320]   thing coming computing that's where you will see this photovolta will centaurus device uh and i
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.680]   should say foldable it's not sam's own it's a two screen device it's not a single screen
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.880]   with glass their glass screens so they're not going to be plastic i mean as much as i love
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.040]   sam's own fold and i give credit to sam's own proportion out there i mean if you read the
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.080]   reports right if you drag your wow fingernail on it you could damage the screen i mean that's
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.200]   really like that's yeesh you know but if you have glass screens you don't really have that issue
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.160]   right plus you can use a pen so this device we we don't know the size of it's between 10 and
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:25.840]   13 inches possibly dual screens folds up uh it may reverse fold too because it has a special hinge
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:32.480]   on it but this thing will be pen uh you know pen first basically as the input modality for it and
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.720]   it's going to run this new version of windows which has been built for this and it's not
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:43.680]   windows traditional windows 32 the classic desktop you know shoe horned into a new form factor
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:50.160]   we're just kind of what the old microsoft would have done this is think of ios with uh chromos
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.360]   mixed with windows and that's what this is kind of going for and it's it should be pretty awesome
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.080]   looking but you're going to see a device that helps redefine a category and i think a lot of
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.160]   people will be like i don't need that or i don't know how to use it but that's always what's cool
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.840]   about new form factors and so this will be good for note taking it'll flip up and you can use a
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:15.120]   keyboard on it and so it's going to have a lot of um i think cool things and you go to see other
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:21.200]   OEMs pop in on this right Lenovo already showed off its full literal foldable device back in June
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.160]   that's coming out around the same time it too will run this operating system so you'll see other
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   OEMs jump on this stuff but it's um it's a new exciting way to think of computers as smartphones
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.880]   become limited in what they can do uh and so i don't know it's going to be but they'll tell
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.320]   the story right of what we expect and we'll hear a little bit more about this operating system
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   that said we don't expect this device to launch until spring or summer 2020 this is it's so
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.360]   interesting to me this almost feels like carolina feels like the a rebirth of microsoft like this
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:57.920]   event will be a coming out party for a microsoft i don't usually think of microsoft as innovative
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:05.840]   as a design forward as trying new things and it feels like this event will be kind of like that
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:12.960]   you agree yeah i don't know i think what you were talking about in terms of like having like
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:19.920]   making like gaming specifically something that could like be performed on like a smaller more
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.480]   mobile device i think that's pretty interesting yeah i don't know yeah that's what everybody's doing
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.960]   that google's doing it with stadia microsoft's x-cloud comes out this year right Daniel it's
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.680]   imminent yeah it's sorry it's going to start beta testing on android uh next bon sony bought
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.400]   guy chi so that they could do it with playstation i mean everybody wants to do this the idea being
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.440]   because everybody's got one of these in their pocket right a smartphone in their pocket and the
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.560]   idea is you should be able to play your game anywhere you are and it should be triple a titles well to
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.280]   have to to have to go and buy all this hardware all the time to go out and and spend a bunch of
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.560]   money to get upgraded to the latest console gamers will do that pc gamers to do that but that's a
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.920]   niche exactly and so to give some of that uh possibility to folks who are a little bit less
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.200]   tied into that i think is good but i wanted to touch on what you said leo about uh microsoft sort
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.000]   of this being an event where they step out and show that they are doing something new i've felt
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.760]   that since the studio was yeah well since such in adela took over the company that's fair too it has
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:25.680]   been a completely reinvented company but it's been drips and drabs like the studio so you really feel
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.000]   this is going to be like this i sounds to me from what you just described annual there yes they're
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.800]   going to be thrown like try this what about this we got a triangular one we got a round one we got
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.560]   one shaped like an egg whatever you need and how long has it been since we saw a new version of
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.720]   windows i mean windows 10 yeah is just like windows 7 is just like i mean there's not that yep it's
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.400]   uh incremental improvement windows like what is that so what from what we understand so the actual
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:58.960]   name is windows core o s they call it w cause internally windows light is also its internal name
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   we don't know what its official public name is so i throw that out there's windows light i don't
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.440]   think that's gonna be its marketing name we'll probably find out hopefully this week but it this
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.840]   is a new operating system built just like how ios was built for conceptually this new form factor new
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.800]   device is going forward and it's going to look as differently as ios does from echo s
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.560]   it's gonna have a start menu is it's i mean kind of it's so these it's not a start menu like in windows
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:32.000]   10 but there is so there's some screenshots already that have kind of come out that show what it looks
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.360]   like you can think of it it looks more traditional like an android or ios launcher app launcher so
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.280]   we're not talking live tiles anymore they're getting rid of the live tile thing for this these are
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:45.920]   just static app icons that people know it looks like as a centralized launcher you hit a little
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.320]   button it pops up in the middle of the screen you pick your apps it's very clean it's very
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.560]   minimalist looking it uses a lot of what we've already seen with the fluent design system so a
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.840]   lot of acrylic a lot of like sort of see through elements it looks very fresh and modern it will
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.560]   be always updated you don't need to right now with the windows update you know you get the update
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:10.480]   you get a notification you got to restart the pc it installs that doesn't really happen on ios
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.880]   and android right it's a lot faster of an update well that's how this is going to operate too so
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:22.000]   this is them bringing the best of windows but to a modern system without all the legacies
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.480]   because the problem with windows you know as it is in desktop is anytime they try to get rid of
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.720]   something yeah they're just what it looks like anytime they try to get rid of something people
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:36.160]   kind of freak out like you know because people still are on windows 7 and so this gives them an
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:43.280]   opportunity to really start fresh with and allows them to jump onto modern computing systems with a
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:50.160]   new look that sort of brings the best of windows so from what we understand it can run win 32
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.520]   but it's primarily going to be universal windows platform as well as their new technologies that
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.320]   they've been doing around there like win forms and everything it can run win 32 but it seems to be
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.040]   part of that containerized systems that they've been building like around linux and so you'll be
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:11.520]   able to run win 32 as a fallback but it's not meant to be a primary because win 32 app development is
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.760]   basically dead right it's it's totally like it's with 32 were dead i mean i think to
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   something that's the his that's where all the security flaws lie that's where all the issues
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:26.080]   lie are you telling me windows light is going to get rid of patch Tuesday yeah i mean it will just
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:32.800]   be these updates that just come through right every day but it's not going to be this legacy code
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.920]   that they need to maintain and it's going to be lighter it'll be faster and it allows them to
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.800]   create an operating system built for these new ideas of hardware which is like a dual-screen
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.120]   device because like yeah you can run windows 10 on dual screens some of us have three screens
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:53.680]   right but for a small foldable device you can do cooler stuff including you know focus and moving
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.600]   things around with the pen and so this is going to be where the magic kind of happens where they've
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.080]   really are trying to focus on the user experience built around this so this is going to be i think
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:08.240]   super exciting and you're right this is sort of a new Microsoft this is them not trying to catch up
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:13.520]   to the market which is the issue with phone you know even zoom right zoom was a total response to
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.440]   the iPod this is them trying to get ahead of the market you know get ahead of the curve and we
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.480]   already see this is where it's going smartphone sales plateaued two years ago and now they're
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.880]   actually dipping i believe the idc just put out how this quarter they're expecting it when the
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:34.480]   sharpest drop and i smartphone sales and so that market is matured right now so now the question
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.320]   is alright in sec what comes next is it smart watches you know and so you're seeing these
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.360]   companies push 5g and foldables and dual screens and this is going to be microsoft's take on it
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.320]   without necessarily going after the phone market that's a hard thing to do i mean microsoft
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:55.600]   foisted tablet computing on us with windows 8 and 8.1 much to their chagrin it's hard to predict
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:02.400]   where the world is going with technology i think often it's it's such a paradigm shift or discontinuity
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.760]   from what has gone before that i don't i really don't expect any big company to be able to figure
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:13.600]   that out it's it's going to come from somewhere unexpected and yet i got to say this is a this is
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:19.120]   a really revitalized microsoft with a whole host of interesting new products and it doesn't feel too
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.160]   spaghetti it doesn't it feels fairly coherent yeah everything makes sense and they're kind of
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.560]   trying to tackle every category it seems the biggest problem they have is windows honestly
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:35.280]   and i think windows light or core os is an interesting attempt to it sounds to me like strip it down
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:42.320]   to the basics make it more robust uh get rid of some of the excess stuff that was causing problems
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.120]   really the hardest thing for microsoft is legacy did you see we talked about it on windows weekly the
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:54.240]   video that the former microsoft programmer posted on youtube in which he said this is about the bugs
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:01.280]   yeah barnacles yeah yeah this is he's barnacles this is the problem he says with microsoft is they
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.240]   fired all the testers that's true we know that and they're relying on telemetry they're relying on
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:12.320]   automated systems and the windows insider program to find bugs to fix bugs to figure out what to do
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:18.720]   next and that's i think he makes a strong point i think paul agreed clearly a failure you agree
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.920]   daniel i want to call it a failure i will say definitely has a lot of room for improvement
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.240]   that said the industry is going that route we're just talking about this with ios this week
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.680]   internally we have a bunch of us use iphones i got the new iphone 11 people is also i mean
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:42.960]   they're now at 13.1.1 exactly so there are so many bugs in ios 13 even though it had an acid beta test
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:48.400]   yeah yeah and so i haven't experienced those but i read those headlines too right and so they're
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   doing this open beta stuff and yet it seems like they have more bugs than ever so you know the problem
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.920]   is the industry is going down this route it is in a sense my you know microsoft to their credit kind
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:05.120]   of gave what people wanted which was this stuff kept leaking out early versions of windows would
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.720]   leak out and then they would get feedback from that from those leakers but they were in a weird
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.280]   position because it was an unofficial version so all they did was say like oh you guys just really
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.080]   want to beta test this stuff and oh so this was more a concession to that than it was an attempt
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.040]   to find out sure i mean you think about now microsoft doesn't get up on stage and go for next year
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.480]   this is what we're doing windows 10 because it's already been announced in the insider
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:31.040]   part of the world investing it so it's taken that out but it feels like i have to say it often feels
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.480]   like stuff that the insiders reported that were known bugs still make it into the shipping version
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.920]   this has happened with 1903 it happened with 1809 so it doesn't feel like the insiders program
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.640]   is actually a good feedback loop for microsoft it feels like either they're ignoring it or
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.440]   they're not getting useful signals i think this is where they need to and they are always tuning
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.000]   the system i mean it's a first it's weird because it's the first time this is being done at this
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.400]   scale and if you know it's kind of a crazy system so i do believe that maybe they're getting too
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.360]   much information that just the yeah and how do you measure that how do you prioritize it you have
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.320]   two million beta testers most of whom have no idea what beta testing even means why do i have no
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:15.680]   they're not going to get valuable signals back from them about real bugs but they're still missing
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.760]   some massive flaws i mean i don't know well on the other hand the argument goes that windows 10 is
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.920]   the most secure version of windows oh they say that every time yeah is it true coming from i i
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.880]   think coming from it departments who don't do the you know advanced insider stuff and usually our
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:39.280]   version behinds they do get a lot more power flexibility on this stuff and from what i've talked
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.960]   to some it departments they actually enjoy what this is but i think we can all agree they can
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:50.800]   definitely improve there i don't think it's going to go away maybe they'll but again as windows 10
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.040]   you know it's going to be around for years i'm not saying they're going to get rid of it obviously
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.760]   it's like i say it's the last version they say it's it this is it but you're going to start to
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:05.040]   see them push with windows quarter west new form-acting devices don't get and that's when it's all
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.320]   that's how they're going to that's how they're going to be yeah i mean that that is going to be
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.680]   the future for the week you weren't i mean because you look at chrome books we all laughed at chrome
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.920]   books years ago including myself yeah and now chrome books are you know oh it's starting to look
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:23.040]   a little serious right in education especially so they did windows 10s which was that was a band-aid
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.920]   that wasn't their solution to chrome os that was like we got to get back into this market
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:34.960]   let's lock down windows 10 a bit more for schools and it departments but windows core os will eventually
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:41.760]   replace that and if you think about where chrome os has done well windows core os is built exactly
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:47.280]   for those kind of markets and consumers go more towards these devices it starts to make sense
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.680]   because then you don't need everything can be up in the cloud eventually we will have cloud
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.160]   operating systems right and 5g will play a role in this but we're still years from now from that
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:01.680]   happening oh that's depressing caroline if i walk into the motherboard offices i'm going to see
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:08.640]   how many windows computers on the desks there i think i think it's probably 50 is it oh i was
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:16.720]   going to say zero really i think no wait no there's let me think that's toxic i just i just use my
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:22.800]   laptop yeah let's see and you're using a mac i'm almost guaranteeing it right i'm on a mac yeah
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.760]   person next to me has one let's see no wait somebody in the chat room said the only person
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.480]   people use windows of the secretaries in the offices of the business suite i don't know if that's a
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:38.720]   fair thing to say but it's kind of it is a business he feels like here the people use windows are
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:45.600]   for the most part in the business office and and i would i you know so motherboard i'm surprised
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.440]   because i would i'll be honest i haven't paid that close attention i would think reporters would
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:56.080]   mostly use macs if you go even okay you watch on wednesday if they ever do a shot of all the people
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:02.560]   at the microsoft event better they call a little white glowing apples all over the place i'll actually
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:07.280]   say it's shifted quite a bit okay yeah they'll show you you can go watch those events and you'll see
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.480]   there's actually quite a bit of uh of those devices out there and a lot of reporters are using
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:17.840]   the arm devices now they're starting to switch because sure people like they want lte right lte
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:24.560]   yeah um yeah i mean windows right now is it's strength is business uh enterprise you know hb has
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.800]   elite books linova has think pads those do very well and gaming i'm running a core i nine hp gaming
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.680]   rig that is just 64 gigs of ram no question if you're a gamer you gotta have windows oh yeah i mean
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:44.400]   it's just you know and that's one of the few areas of pcs that never hit that when pcs sales are
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.880]   dropping everybody's like oh it's a post-pc world it was gaming pcs just kept pushing through all that
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:55.280]   and it's gotten even more huge so uh but yeah i mean that's but that's on that's the past still right
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.400]   so what we'll see on wednesday will be sort of the future of where microsoft is going and yeah it's
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.040]   in the dollar's credit you know he decided to cut back on markets where they clearly couldn't
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:12.000]   compete in uh usually in the widespread consumer markets um and are trying to go into markets where
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.400]   they can define that category first right and that's what that is way harder so yeah oh it's all
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.480]   also i said mention surface earbuds we are hearing those will be there oh everybody even
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:28.400]   amazon announced here i know amazon has a show everybody's got earbuds uh we'll talk about amazon
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:36.160]   actually 25 some new products holy moly 80 some new announcements crazy crazy story that is thrown
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.560]   to get against the wall but there definitely it's around experience but see there's well we'll get
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.760]   there we're gonna get there we're gonna talk about their spaghett we're gonna talk about earbuds and
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:50.640]   spaghetti in just a bit mmm that's good stuff brought to you today by wasabi that goes well with your
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.640]   spaghetti in your butt indeed not that kind not the green ball you get next to your sushi i'm
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:38:02.080]   talking with sobby hot cloud storage was created by two guys i i know pretty well uh david friend
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:07.440]   who was the former ceo of carbonite jeff flowers his cto they actually when they did carbonite they
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.800]   invented a new way of writing the hard drives they patented it too lays data on discs sequentially
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:20.080]   as opposed to in blocks that gives you big speed up big efficiency improvement and that's
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:25.680]   kind of the incentive for them starting wasabi they've moved on from carbonite jeff and
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:32.880]   david now have a new startup wasabi that is truly amazing look at what you talked about it already
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.960]   we already talked about people are going to be moving to the cloud you want it i can make the
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.600]   argument i think it's nowadays in the days of ransomware a very good argument that your cloud
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:46.880]   storage is safer than your on-premises storage in the hard drives in the closet the server those are
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:53.360]   the ones that are going to get bit by ransomware the place to put your data the place more businesses
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:39:00.000]   are going is the cloud by 2025 according to gartner 80 percent of enterprises will have shut down
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.480]   their traditional data centers 80 percent so the question is well where do i go now everybody
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.560]   just says well you know it's obvious you go to microsoft amazon or google one of the big three
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:17.040]   and amazon is like three times the size of the rest of them uh i want to just add a fourth name i
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.880]   know i know you know it's going to be hard to bring the bus well let's not do those guys let's do
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:26.320]   wasabi but just add this to the list and show the boss the benefits for instance because of this
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:36.000]   revolutionary patented process they're 80 percent cheaper one-fifth the cost of s3 six times faster
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.560]   and they don't charge for egress s3 charges for egress they don't charge for api request and
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:48.720]   they use the same s3 api so really it's plug and play for you it's easy but you get so much more
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:54.800]   nine eleven nines adorability you can designate some storage and you'll want to do this in this
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.440]   day and age of ransomware as immutable that is nothing can change it even a malware process
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.320]   running rampant in your computer that storage and wasabi cannot be messed with
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:11.760]   data center redundancy of course uh it's himp a compliant it's fin recompile it's cjis compliant
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.880]   it is really going to be more secure more reliable more robust than you're on premises storage it even
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:22.880]   does uh integrity checking on your data every 90 days all your data is checked for integrity to
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:29.680]   make sure that not not one bit is flipped wasabi's amazing calculate for yourself and start a free
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:39.040]   trial of unlimited storage for a month go to wasabi wasabi wasabi.com and make sure to use the offer

[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:56.560]   amazon s3 free egress faster better more secure thank you wasabi for your support wasabi.com
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:03.520]   thank you for supporting twit by using that offer code twit. Amazon was just i wish we i wish we
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.800]   could did anybody here go to the amazon event i wish we could have gone to that i did not yeah i
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:15.440]   was in seattle i know you guys are on the east coast but uh the only person i know who's there is uh
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:22.720]   stacey higginbotham far this week in google show she filed a long report uh stacey on iot.com on
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.840]   all the things she also came on tech news weekly to talk about it did she yeah oh good
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.240]   she was on just this last so what was your impression i mean this is uh it wasn't streamed so we couldn't
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.680]   cover it live well one of the things that uh i wanted to know and what i found interesting is that
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.480]   amazon actually started the show without announcing any products at all in fact they started like
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.960]   the first ten minutes of the show we're just talking about privacy we're talking well that's
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:53.040]   really interesting since the next hour of the show was putting microphones in every orifice of
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:58.400]   your home you got holes we've got microphones i mean but i guess it is smart for them to start
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.200]   with privacy it's just i don't know how credible that is yeah well and it what was interesting is
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:09.840]   kind of not just privacy but also sort of becoming more comfortable with these devices and trying
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:16.880]   to limit confusion so they along with talking about how they announced a plug socket with a
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:22.080]   microphone on it yes and a light so you put it as a night light but this is how and then you could
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.560]   talk to echo from anywhere that's how echo works that's the whole thing i guess if you if you have
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.080]   echo you're all in on echo right well you got a microphone in the living room might as well put
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.480]   it in every room right exactly and so the point here though is that now they've got this thing set
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.520]   up to where you can have your voice recordings automatically deleted every three months you can
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.960]   ask a le xa to play back a voice recording that just happened and one of my favorite features is
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.200]   the fact that now you can say why did you do that so wait a minute what so this is the picture
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:57.680]   stacy posted echo why did you do that i do that to serie all the time but she never is she doesn't
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:05.120]   what are you talking about you found a web search for open the that pod bay door out what are you
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   talking about this is great so for example say music just starts playing randomly on your echo
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:15.520]   and you turn to the device and all the time but what the heck just happened why did you do that
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:21.760]   and it could say well that's because this device you told me to leave started bluetooth streaming
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.400]   to this echo tower so we will give you that's just a snitch now basically snitch yeah on the
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:35.040]   other devices yeah well okay you cover security uh caroline um is do do you have an echo
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:42.720]   in every orifice no i have zero smart devices see i rest my case like if you work for mother
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:49.360]   board you don't put that stuff in your house no no and i have i have friends that do uh it just
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:53.360]   like i don't know it makes me uncomfortable it makes me feel like a little bit less cities in their
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.920]   house which makes me sad but i'm just gonna ask if you didn't want to block the sound whenever you
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.720]   come over can you hit that button please yeah who you when you hear your friends houses you tell them
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:10.880]   i'm not coming in unless you turn off that thing i don't i'm just i just say like oh that's interesting
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:16.640]   how interesting that you would allow jeff phasos to listen to everything you say how interesting
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:23.440]   yeah and you know i'm thinking a lot about the allow products that are marketed toward
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:29.040]   children and the certain protections that they're trying to to introduce about that but it doesn't
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:34.560]   really seem like it's solving the problem there like as i understand they have some sort of feature
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.800]   where you can communicate with like other parents that have like a lexic compatible devices for
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:46.400]   their kids um i forget which article this was in there already being sued by some parents
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:55.280]   for tapping children with ads so this is already on the docket there yeah there's that problem
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.920]   that hasn't been resolved and there's i don't know i just keep thinking about the fact that like
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:04.640]   let's say you have like a kid who does like a play day over the house of another kid's house
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:13.840]   you know and there's not like there still isn't that we would have to really resocialize our like
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:19.200]   people as parents in order to be asking those kinds of questions about like you know whether there are
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.160]   devices in their house gives you if if the other kid for instance like let's say you're a parent
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:29.840]   and you give your kid you know and advice you know like that's you know that's your decision as a
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.080]   child but if you're sending your kid over to somebody else's house is that even a discussion
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:39.920]   that different parents are happening yeah right so what are your kids allen jim to my house you
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:47.600]   have echo devices in your home you got i asked i have echo i have google yeah i have siri he actually
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.640]   has this robot that comes around and asks for your social security number it's
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:58.320]   i i have cameras everywhere um you know the in fact when you come to the front door there's a
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.920]   nest hello camera doing face recognition on you it tells me there's somebody i don't know at the
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:09.680]   front door or it says michaels at the front door it knows and in fact when you sign up i've mentioned
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:16.240]   this before it says you should consider local laws when you set this up but nobody probably does i
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.160]   feel like it's a great security feature i hadn't thought about that though in terms of the parents
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.720]   that's a big yes that's a big thing nobody should send their children to my house no one should send
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   their children to an echo house well right there's like there's that aspect of it and you know the
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:37.040]   thing i think about a lot is like if you're a child growing up and that's a part of your household and
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:43.520]   that's something that you are like growing up socialized to trust and interact with i mean that's going to
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:49.280]   be shaping your entire attitude toward like what sorts of privacy trade-offs you see is acceptable
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.600]   for the rest of your life because that's what you've been raised on that's what you understand and
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:59.280]   you know is that trust misplaced i mean that's up for you to decide but um i don't know if that's
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.560]   also something that i think about honestly i gave up and i think most people gave up and just say
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:11.360]   fine i'm gonna take the convenience i don't think that putting that burden on the individual user is
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:16.480]   really the right way to do it i this is what i think because nobody's a nobody's going to pay
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:22.320]   that much attention b people aren't going to want to give up these features because of some
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:29.360]   unknown you know cloud of uncertainty about privacy because we don't really know what's going on
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:34.480]   this is what i i'm going to just start a campaign we got it's got to be legislation
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:40.640]   it's got to be federal legislation and it's a very simple thing companies that collect information
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:45.520]   about you with them we just learned by the way big study ours technique i had this story i'm sure
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:54.000]   you did too unvice about uh tv's spying on you even if you don't have a netflix account if there's
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.080]   netflix on your roku roku's sending information about what you watch back to netflix they have a
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:05.520]   microphone some tv's have cameras they are observing what you watch they say oh he just left the room
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.160]   he's not seeing this ad and they're sending that all back to advertisers what i want is
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.360]   legislation that says if you collect information of any kind about users you have to disclose
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:22.080]   exactly what you collect how you collect it there's a microphone there's a camera what happens to
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.760]   that information not merely how we store it how we secure it but who you sell it to and what they
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:35.520]   do with it so what happens that information and there should be an opt out at least an opt out button
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:41.040]   i think maybe by default it should be opt in only but let's say companies say but that's how we
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:46.400]   monetize we give you free gmail so we can't do that but at least there should be a check mark
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:50.400]   and that and that disclosure should be very clear i mean i think apple does this and it
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:54.480]   shouldn't be in a 400 page terms of service that's the problem it needs to be done clearly
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:01.040]   simply what do i what data do you collect how do you collect it what do you do with it opt in or
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:06.720]   out and and the ability to delete stuff yeah i think deleting which great which they're offering
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.640]   now at least almost all the companies now are giving that because they can call it does not
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   announce that too yeah i think i can't agree with that means though right because like they do keep
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.880]   certain bits of information even after you like delete recordings and that was the thing with the
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:26.560]   kids devices too like oh you can set up your kids recordings to be deleted but then like they
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:31.760]   still exist somewhere or the transcripts still exist or something to that effect you know i
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.840]   don't think it should the burden shouldn't be on users the burden shouldn't be on lawsuits
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:42.320]   it should be in law and it should be enforced now that may be asking an awful lot but i think
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.000]   that's the right way to solve it and i think that's the right way to solve it because what we have at
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.560]   this time is a situation that's a free for all where no one the everyday person does not care i
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:59.280]   remember talking to a friend of mine around my age and saying uh that tv that you just got you
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.880]   know you might want to get this tv instead of this tv because this one doesn't have smart features
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.240]   well what i want the smart features well this is what's happening and it's tracking you well i
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:11.840]   don't care i don't care that it's tracking me there's a lot of apathy surrounding our privacy
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:17.440]   protections and so we almost need that law in place too for the folks who don't quite get it when
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.880]   it comes to what we're giving up in whenever we say yes yes yes yes to all these different privacy
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:28.000]   policies and so if we're kind of not protecting ourselves or more importantly kind of like you said
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.640]   carolina we've kind of been um even now i've been socialized a little bit to to be okay with these
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:40.080]   things and it's only getting more and more as we put these rainbow striped echo dots and people's
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:45.280]   and in little kids rooms we're only going to be more and more comfortable with these devices
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.440]   but if we're not protecting our own privacy then yeah i think there need to be laws in place to
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:55.600]   help us with that and help to sort of combat the apathy that's there and look how far things have
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:02.000]   shifted since 2012 i believe it was when maryksov announced they connect for xbox and people freaked
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.480]   out they're like i'm not putting a camera on microphone in my living room maryksov of all the
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.880]   companies maryksov has always been pretty good about data protection of users at least they don't
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:16.160]   monetize like google does but they got a lot of pushback from that people didn't want a camera
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.040]   seven years later these things are just normal now you know they're in every room
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.840]   and then amazon just announced a bunch of stuff that was just like it borderline is
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:30.400]   on ridiculous it's just like well we're going to do it in a ring now because we can you know
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:35.040]   that's um and it's just like we've never had that conversation i'll also say you know
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:41.440]   facebook culture contributed to this you know we went from i don't want my name listed in the
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.400]   yellow pages you know and people would take their names off and we went from that world to
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:53.040]   people posting intimate details on facebook with their location and photos and family like
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:59.280]   voluntarily like that is to me absolutely insane but it happened within just a couple of years
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.080]   and you know that's the old joke right about you know fbi you have to investigate people and
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.280]   all they had to do is create facebook okay like now you can monitor everyone
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:12.880]   uh and it's like now afterwards we're having this discussion but it's almost too late and so
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:21.360]   it is funny i can't believe me like everybody knows everything about me so yeah so uh let's
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:26.720]   talk about all the new spy i mean uh convenience devices in amazon has introduced they have
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   started ring they put a dot a clock in the dot i like this okay so this is one thing where i
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:38.320]   point exactly i have to give amazon credit because they the one thing that i see them doing is yes
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.600]   they're throwing all these spaghetti projects out there but they're actually paying attention
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:46.480]   to what their customers are are doing with these devices well i'll get this is actually kind of
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.680]   interesting because as far as we could tell they killed the spot that was the little ball
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.480]   with the cloth that looked like a little alarm clock you put on your bedside table but it had a
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.440]   camera in it and nobody wanted it not on their bedside table on their bedside table that's
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.120]   so as far as we could tell the spot is gone but this kind of is the replacement so no camera
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:11.120]   no it does listen well but the most important thing here is they heard they saw that with these
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:17.040]   echo dots without the without the clock the most common question that there's what time is it
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:22.640]   is what time is it like well let's put a let's put a clock in it and it turns out that the uh microwave
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.520]   oven that amazon announced is kind of almost like i just oh i see if this works no no it does
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:31.200]   they were like let's just see if this works it ended up becoming a super popular product and so
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:36.480]   they've gone all in now they've got a convection oven slash microwave slash all this stuff this is
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.440]   what amazon's really good at right i mean they they what are they they're a data company yes
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:46.240]   and they and the commerce is supported by all the things they know about you
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:53.360]   uh and your use of their products or another product sometimes they'll get rid of uh a phone
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:57.840]   that they made that it was not it was not a hit and sometimes they'll make a microwave oven that's
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.640]   a that's a the fire is years ago i don't think amazon would make that same mistake i feel like
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.840]   amazon they might try stuff but i don't think they would go all in on a fire phone in the way that
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:13.920]   they did i think they know too i mean phone is way more infrastructure right and it's so much
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:19.600]   difficult to get into um well microsoft learned that lesson didn't they yeah farts yeah billions
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.240]   of dollars later the funny thing about all the elixir stuff you know they we talk about them
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:29.520]   being successful with it and in one sense they are obviously the releasing all these devices but
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:35.280]   fundamentally wasn't elixir supposed to be about ordering amazon products like it was supposed to
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:42.080]   be this way of interacting with amazon.com on a different level so people would order more stuff
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:46.560]   but i believe there's a report it might have been vice i covered that uh that only like two
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.760]   percent of users actually use these devices to order stuff from amazon so from that perspective
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:57.760]   i usually these things as like not necessary successful in their original intent instead
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:04.640]   they've become alarm clocks timers and jukeboxes right that you just play music on them uh and i
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:09.520]   guess some people families you know use it to communicate with each other i still find that weird but
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:15.280]   sure enough you know so i i do question how much money they make off these because they sell them
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:21.360]   for so cheap it's almost seems like at cost so that you know they're making it some other way
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.600]   through monetization of data presumably but we don't know necessarily all the details there
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:32.720]   so i i wonder it made my family switch from spotify to amazon music yeah me too because that came with
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:39.200]   it and it's well it's easier and blah blah blah. I feel like jeff look jeff bezos is obviously
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   pretty damn smart and i think jeff looks at this as a long-term investment what what cool
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.960]   what okay as long as they don't lose a ton of money on this stuff and i'm sure they don't
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:55.920]   what could possibly be wrong about having all of these devices in people's homes i mean this is
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:00.240]   even if he hasn't figured it out yet but this is classic bezos i think this is what they did with
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:06.400]   aws somebody said jeff we got all this server you know stuff we don't really use fully well let's
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:11.200]   try this if we make some money it's now makes more money than anything else amazon does jeff
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.320]   you know what we could actually write make a thing that responds to voice and tells you what time
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.560]   it is and do is timers what do you think let's try it see what happens i think jeff is pretty
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:27.040]   strategic they buy they buy uh the grocery stores and then they have these echo buds that you keep
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:33.280]   in your ears and you go to a whole foods market and you say what is the milk on does it do that yes
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:38.320]   oh my freaking god yes that's weird they just are drawing all these connections i don't have to talk
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:42.800]   to a human anymore i could say where's the milk it's literally to the left ear her
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:48.880]   um i do that in home depot all the time god what wait i i use their webs they don't have it on
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:54.480]   on if they had that on a voice assistant i would love it yeah they're happy really good oh bye
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:59.360]   i'm the buds just for that a long i use their i use their website to to find and by the way i
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.600]   find stuff rather than talk to a person now you don't need to pay so many people to be in the store
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.440]   in fact honestly you don't really need any book yeah you just walk in yeah that's happening all
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:13.280]   over the place yeah i mean movie my movie theater recently got rid of the uh ticket sales counter
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:19.280]   you have to buy it at concession now no way oh yeah it's my theater too and if you buy it online you
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:23.120]   get the barcode you just shove it under a reader you just walk in you go to you go to theater still
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:28.400]   something you do i just saw rambo eight they're rampos i just saw that yesterday too
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:34.080]   i didn't realize people it was amazingly bad i like it was i don't know it was something
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:40.960]   i was neither of i we're together on this uh yeah actually carolina i wanted to hear your take on
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:48.880]   sidewalk because this is kind of a creepy thing there were amazon's trying to uh just
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:54.880]   blink at the entire united states with its own uh so it's wireless protocol yeah it started with a
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:01.840]   dog tag they say we seeded the la area with what how many did they put out they're not that many
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:08.880]   like a hundred and we were able to cover the entire LA basin with this low raw
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:14.480]   wan oh no it's not low raw when it competes with low raw wan and sigfox i just wanted to say that oh
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:22.960]   yes my cousin's low and it uses the 900 megahertz band it's a low bandwidth it's kind of replacing
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:30.800]   these bluetooth trackers with its own kind of uh low bandwidth tracking device and it's a mesh
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:36.560]   network so that's the whole idea they were able to put these uh all over the la basin and they had
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:41.280]   complete coverage i'm trying to find the it wasn't like up to a mile i think yeah so anywhere your
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:46.800]   dog went in la thanks to the hundred or so they put out there uh they could track that's pretty
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.480]   impressive yeah until they start using it on humans who go into whole foods
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:56.640]   yeah yeah i don't know this just raises alarm bells for me i mean obviously
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:03.360]   like i don't know i'm i'm thinking a lot about i mean i've reported a lot about like ring
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:08.720]   specifically and the way that like this is an amazon product that's been able to like expand
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:13.440]   its customer base like in part through doing like local police partnerships all around the
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:20.080]   country and i feel like if like working on a local level and moving outwards i think this connects
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:27.440]   here i don't know it's just caroline i replaced my ring because of you you know really
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:32.080]   wow i replaced it with the with the google nest hello camera so i don't know
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:38.080]   i thought i was in that game not a solution that's the one that doesn't face recognition
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:43.680]   but at least the cops are involved well it's not like amazon is selling it's not like amazon is
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:48.080]   selling face recognition to the cops or anything that's true it's wait wait oh here's the thing that
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:53.680]   people don't acknowledge a lot about ring um i mean they have been working on developing like in
[00:59:53.680 --> 01:00:00.000]   house facial recognition not like re k o g like not amazon's brand recognition
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.720]   but like their own brand of recommend uh facial recognition i mean that's been in development for
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:12.000]   like a couple years and it's not like a public facing product yet um but currently i think the
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.840]   way it used to be was that like anybody's footage could be submitted for like testing and i think
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:24.560]   now they only use the things that are posted on neighbors because they got caught yeah but neighbors
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:30.640]   so neighbors is also a problem and i and this is the kind of creep me out so when you have a ring
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:37.600]   doorbell and you have the neighbors software um neighbors can say there's a there's a guy almost
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.560]   always an african-american oddly enough there's a guy walking around the neighborhood you know
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:49.040]   looking into windows and stuff and so it really created this terror even in petaluma this terrorizing
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:56.320]   and also felt like kind of biased uh scare stuff and it happened all the time you know and
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.520]   i got that kind of was another reason i got rid of it it kind of creeped me out at the same time i
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:08.240]   can see why people wanted that now that's opt-in isn't it right so you can the neighbors app you
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.960]   don't have to download it but you also don't even need a ring product in order to download it and
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.560]   it's compatible with other security devices so theoretically like if you have like your nest
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:24.640]   footage you could still post it on neighbors even though it's not a ring product um the whole idea
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.520]   what's interesting is that like you can sort things into a couple of different categories on
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:35.600]   neighbors and three out of the five categories involve like suspicious person unknown person or
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:43.360]   stranger um so all of these things need to be like it's literally like the like the structure of the
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:51.600]   platform encourages people to like assume the worst about the people that they capture on camera
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:59.040]   you know and there's a there's a culture of just like even if you're not sure post but what is that
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.200]   feed into people's ideas about like the like what their neighborhood is or if it's safe or like
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.480]   who they should trust or who is considered like maybe not a part of their neighborhood because they
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:16.640]   call it a neighborhood watch and that's one accurate way of looking at it that everybody who uses
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.800]   the app is automatically inducted into this digital neighborhood watch but i think like a better way
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.920]   of putting it yeah like almost closer to like a gated community you know because you're determining
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:34.720]   like what sorts of like behaviors and people belong and who doesn't and even like relatively
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:41.200]   like normal behaviors can automatically be spun into something that looks a little bit more
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:47.840]   suspicious for instance i don't know like let's say someone let's say i don't know i experience
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.560]   this if i'm looking for you know an address and i haven't been there before i walk up to the house
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:59.360]   and i realize i'm at the wrong address um i've seen footage and it's i mean honestly normally of
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:04.800]   like people of color often men you know they go up to the door and it's like oh are they checking
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.320]   out the house are they like scoping it out for like a robbery right it's like no they almost
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.360]   definitely are not doing that and very rarely will people actually push back on that often people
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.840]   are just like call the police call the police yeah you know that's the automatic response you know
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.560]   what are we it's a vigilante thing and it creates terror it really does create terror yeah kerson
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:32.880]   is your mic on yes i actually had a wanted to posit a a situation in which this might be useful
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:41.600]   there was a shooting outside my son's high school this this friday oh my god
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:49.360]   and i know like we're not that far from the high school what if the the person had run past my
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:56.960]   neighbors enabled ring doorbell like that's not the same there's not value to this but i completely
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:03.440]   agree with caroline because i had the same kind of feeling it creates this general low level sense
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.880]   of i'm scared i'm scared i'm scared i'm scared and we already have enough of that in this world
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.600]   i had it's called mean world syndrome is that what it's called yeah the overall well stranger danger
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:20.240]   of as we take in media and and different bits and use it make us feel like things are bad then
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.960]   we start to see the world is yes scary yeah mean world syndrome and it's really happening and it's
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.760]   thanks to 24 hour news cycle you watch a lot of news what is news report they're only going to
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.040]   report terrible things right and it didn't used to feel like that because we weren't reporting on
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.600]   you know you only watch it half an hour a night and you think that what's happening way way far away
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.520]   is also happening right next door right and so then you add on top of that this low level like
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:49.120]   you said anxiety about who who's supposed to be here and for me i don't know half of my neighbors
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.640]   already so how would i know who actually are my neighbors and who aren't actually you're the one
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.120]   that's they're complaining yes absolutely have you seen me of course i am you're the one they're
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:04.000]   saying i don't know who this guy is but he's been walking around our linky brown guy walking around
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:12.720]   complex you're the guy i think i think in terms of the of the shooting question and in terms of crime
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:17.200]   i think that like it's honestly i mean it's one of their selling points especially in terms of like
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.320]   these police partnerships because it is a situation like oh well if i can actually like help solve this
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.120]   thing why wouldn't i but i think the important thing to keep in mind here is like the actual
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.160]   infrastructure that makes that possible so for instance like if a police department partners with
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:38.720]   the ring they get access to a tool that allows them to like blanket request footage within like a
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:44.480]   certain geographical area and they don't normally a lot of times you would need like for instance like
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.200]   a warrant to obtain this and the way that the ring app works it's kind of like an alternative of
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.200]   going door to door in a sense like it's an alternative to going up to someone's door
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:06:00.480]   and saying like oh can i have this footage and in one sense you could say like oh well isn't this
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.800]   sort of platform that allows the police to do it just like from the computer isn't that just like
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.520]   you know making it more efficient helping this project like helping this process work faster
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:17.200]   but i think there's also an argument to be made that there's certain protections that are built
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:23.920]   into things working at a pace that is perhaps a little bit slower like do we need to speed up
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.720]   the process of asking people for their personal information to like hand over to the police like
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:36.640]   is that something that we necessarily need to speed up or automate or change or disrupt in any
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.080]   kind of way and i guess it sort of depends on your perspective about that i don't know like here's the
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:48.880]   problem this has happened without a public conversation this is a bacterial way for police
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:55.840]   to put cameras everywhere but there hasn't been but it's kind of in secret it's being done home by
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:01.760]   home without any public conversation about what's happening any agreement that yes this is something
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.880]   we want and of course i i don't blame the police this helps them with their enforcement
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.440]   but we also understand that in this country there needs to be that conversation the public
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:18.560]   needs to be in control of what the police are doing and this has all been done kind of behind
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:25.520]   the scenes without anybody's knowledge and in fact ring has been enforcing ndas and secrecy
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.200]   agreements with the police they know that if people know about this there's some upset
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.040]   but they make sure the police aren't allowed to talk about it i would also just throw a
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:40.000]   conversation i i i do have like ring products and like uh i don't put cameras in my home
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.880]   uh just because i find that weird but having cameras that face out from my home or my backyard i
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:54.240]   do have those and me too personally i like them because i get a lot of packages and you know people
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.960]   literally drive through neighborhoods they follow ups trucks yep you know and they run up and grab
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:04.240]   stuff i'll also say though there is this concern about you know the police and having access and i
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.800]   agree we should definitely have that conversation i mean cctv in the uk is this big thing right everything
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:14.160]   is recorded you even have just i mean people right now we just record each other all the time and it
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.520]   happens all the time now where you can't get away with anything because there's going to be somebody
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:22.560]   with a smartphone making a video this is recorded yeah i didn't know we don't record any of our shows
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:28.320]   i just want everybody to feel better about that yeah okay also say conversely it also helps against
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:34.000]   police too and there were some footage that came out recently of some police knocked on their door
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.400]   and they're investigating believe it was a 13 year old and they said the door was open and so
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:45.520]   they came in without being invited in and they took this kid and put his arm behind his back and
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:52.720]   cuffed him and then we got a record yeah and and he wasn't arrested there was no crime but the video
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.480]   clearly shows that the police abused their authority here it was only because they actually had a camera
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.520]   facing it was actually not their front door i was inside you know but it goes to show you that you
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:09.440]   can also protect yourself there was also another video footage recently cops came up i believe
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:18.400]   an alarm had gone off and they a guy came down and he had a gun it was his house it was his gun
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.480]   he had permit and the police shot him and it was all caught on their own his own security cameras
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:32.240]   now he survived but we have a visual record of that of the police overreacting in this situation and so
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:39.840]   there's pros and cons too i like the idea sometimes if police come to my door i actually don't mind
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.680]   having them recorded because i don't trust the police even though i have a system that could aid
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.200]   them in case i do need help so this is complicated this is a complicated one i guess my main point
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:56.320]   is it should be done in a public discussion right should be done openly it shouldn't be done secretly
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:02.480]   it shouldn't be done by a big company like amazon without really stitching them all together
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:08.400]   without really telling anybody without getting public consent you know this this is the kind
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   of thing that shouldn't be done in secret it should be done with all of us involved in the
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.480]   conversation anyway that's my thought right yeah it's no it's true because a lot none of these
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.320]   partnerships have been done in such a way where there's been like a public feedback period for
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.640]   instance like these are all and it's built into the contracts that the terms of the agreement
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.960]   aren't supposed to be made public and that's the case with pretty much all of those communications
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.440]   and i think in terms of like not having cameras on the inside of the home it's interesting because
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.520]   that's a line that a lot of people seem to draw and in terms of catching the police on camera i
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.080]   think the important thing to keep in it's interesting because i've heard that argument before from
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.640]   i reported a story last year from vaultsmore and do you remember when they had like the aerial
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:58.960]   surveillance program and they didn't tell the people before they started doing it um so there's
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.240]   there was a group of people they still are like lobbying for that that program to come back because
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:10.800]   they say oh well we don't trust the police there's documented cases of misconduct and if we have
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:18.800]   this objective i'm the sky oh yeah that's it um if we have this objective i'm the sky then maybe
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:26.480]   this could be used like not just for the police's purposes but to protect us but of course that you
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:35.280]   know that relies on that footage being used in a system that is going to like work in the favor
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:41.520]   of people that specifically say that the system has never worked in their favor so like we are adding
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.800]   things that are making this right we're adding things that are making all of these processes work
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.760]   quicker but are they actually working better like i think that's the question that we have to be
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:55.280]   that we have to be asking here or at least thinking about you know yeah i think there's a
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.640]   report recently about body cams where you know there's a big push for my support this idea because
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.040]   it does have this oh you know the police are recording their behaviors but then there is
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:11.840]   manipulation of these cameras right also cops are turning them off during certain contested arrests
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:17.280]   and and and since is or the footage gets lost or you know and or we don't get access to it it
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:23.520]   comes out six months later you know so like they're definitely yeah when they control the footage
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:30.640]   and that's that's a problem but it is this weird situation where the fact is when people are recorded
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:37.200]   if it tends to result in better behavior which is like i was in china recently the place operates
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:43.520]   like a machine it's like but i mean what are they trading off in terms of freedom uh for that right
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:48.880]   they have a very authoritarian government and so this is something that this should not be imposed
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:54.400]   this is something that should be the result of a long conversation uh with all public discourse
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.680]   public committees yeah they should be involved in with a community involved with the police
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.400]   they both get access to this that's the problem i have with policing united states right now which
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:09.760]   is that it's too separated from the communities uh and and people don't get involved enough and
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.520]   don't have a voice within the police department you know and it's you know it's it's a problem yeah
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:21.440]   let's take a break when we come back there was one product uh at this amazon event that i think

[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:30.320]   favorite item before we get to our favorite item from the amazon event did you would you like this
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.440]   idea of a plug socket that adds amazon echo to every plug in your house.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:43.040]   Wow my dream your dream come true you know what carol and i know what's gonna happen you're gonna
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:48.720]   it's gonna be like a waterfall dam is gonna be worse and you're gonna go from zero to a hundred
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:56.480]   devices. Wow that'll be the day that'll be the day there's a new uh about uh the echo loop i'm just
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:01.760]   i keep thinking about that i don't understand this no okay all these problems i don't get any of
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:08.720]   this what the loop is a ring which is not oddly enough a exercise ring it's a titanium encased
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:15.520]   ring that has a mic and speaker in it it doesn't measure your footsteps it just is a way to talk
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:22.480]   to amazon on your finger and take calls apparently if you really want to look weird well now i've
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:28.000]   taken calls on my apple watch it works but it's that's a we have yeah but i mean that goes back to
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   like cartoons and dick tricks in our heads we have that but the ring it's kind of cool yet to do this
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:42.640]   it's like hello hello mom i'm talking to you what mom no that is very weird this is a calls any
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.600]   part come on this is an invite yeah right this is an invitation only hundred twenty nine dollars
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:52.960]   and i'm gonna guess it's going to be one of those pieces of spaghetti that falls off the wall i
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:58.560]   don't see this turn on your mic we can't hear you yeah i don't really see that being successful um
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:05.840]   that product in particular i think that the echo specks are going the right way there's spectacles
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.360]   if you look at them they're pretty thick i almost ordered them i almost signed up for them but i
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.680]   don't know i don't know i don't know i like that what north is doing i think is super impressive in
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:21.680]   terms of wearable in classes i don't see those what is that oh so north they look just like those but
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.720]   they actually have a little heads up the slice oh yes i think it has those yeah yeah and you have a
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:33.280]   little ring that controls it and where they are in in terms of making that product is way ahead
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:38.800]   where i thought the industry would be and such such a small startup has basically done that um and
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:45.040]   where google kind of failed with class right so i i do find the wearable space and glasses really
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.640]   interesting but just having a mic and a little speaker in there for Alexa
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:55.440]   i don't see the value as much as where it's having the little pop up display i mean that's really
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.800]   where this stuff is going you want to see my notifications on my head's up display all the time
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:04.640]   right i mean that sounds like could you imagine like this is the world where living right you're
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.560]   going to walk around you're going to look at someone it's going to hot face i need them it'll bring
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:13.040]   down information probably from linkedin and you're going to know everything about them and for some
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.080]   people this is actually going to help right i mean this is the problem with humans is we're
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:23.600]   fundamentally flawed our brains are limited and we want to as soon as we can become cyborgs we
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.640]   absolutely will and it's like we could talk about it now but just like how people talk about we need
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:34.000]   to have laws about having sex with robots because they're gonna do that oh yeah oh yeah yeah that's
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.360]   a thing in Japan they've already have they're already having this conversation because that's
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.600]   where that industry is moving towards look if you want to have sex with robots i think you should
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.840]   be allowed to have sex with robots people are marrying people are marrying robot i mean it's like
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:52.160]   why not it's not who's who's getting hard here the robot exactly but so like that's where this
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:57.520]   stuff is going towards so i i think what north is doing is interesting but i mean if we don't like
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.000]   ring right now like i i just i don't think there's no camera in these uh in these folkles right the
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.320]   north by no not yet that so it's really different google yeah they're it's just it's just uh it's uh
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:17.840]   it's for output only now um we are attempting at this point to get our amazon twerking bear working
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:23.280]   oh my god this is from the same company that gave us the big mouth billy bass last year oh my god
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.680]   i may let me give them a microphone yeah you have it it's only like 13 bucks actually it's pretty
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:33.280]   impressive no it's forty dollars come on by the way i saw for 13 wait no this is 10 bucks i did

[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:11.520]   service it was cool now who can twerk to Beethoven but jimmy this is the moonlight twerk sonata
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:18.560]   just 53 does it not make you tear up a little bit left buttock kind of killing it it's beautiful
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.320]   this is a weird black mirror episode man i don't know are we gonna get a youtube takedown for the
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:30.000]   for the well only if they do it in order to not uh it works i don't think food mixed been
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.640]   made to open i think it's i think it's fried litigious echo stop playing music
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:42.240]   how about this can we oh but i'm not on amazon i was thinking maybe we could play this we can
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:46.560]   tech uh but i but we're not on amazon it has to be on amazon music you can do this though that's
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:55.360]   what simon says what echo simon says subscribe to twit subscribe to twit
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:05.120]   i think everybody who subscribes to twit should have to wiggle their buttocks
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:12.080]   every single time so it's only fair there's there's uh that's jimmy uh jimmy comes in normal
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:17.680]   jimmy form jimmy also has a holiday form where there's a santa santa santa hat and one there's
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:21.840]   also yeah santa so there are three different kinds so last year i bought michael our 16-year-old
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:27.440]   the bigmouth billy best he immediately disconnected it he was so freaked out by the whole thing he
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:33.520]   just hated it my son still has his big mouth does he it talks it talks to echo and then it
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.080]   it plays oh she talks through it through the back she talks through the fish echo
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:48.880]   echo echo i like it it makes me feel less alone in the world we deserve exactly this is the future
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:55.360]   we deserve well excuse me um i think loads of fun you could have with this it's so silly but echo
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.280]   beatbox for me
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.280]   oh it's not doing it
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:15.360]   what but the way the bear did i break the bear i think i broke the bear wow it couldn't
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:21.200]   just cancel by order it's a twerking bear not a beatboxing bear
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:28.240]   echo echo yes simon says watch the way i twerk
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:36.960]   okay it doesn't like whatever you do you have to engage that skill to do it no i don't like it
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:41.840]   simon says watch the way i twerk saying it more emphatically will not solve your
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:46.080]   problem right i give up it's like when you're talking to somebody who doesn't speak english you
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:52.640]   don't shout no but i just the simon says work anywhere anyway any that's jimmy the twerking
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.800]   any who to start stay tuned for the uh the hands-on tech review of the talking bear
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:07.120]   which includes i would say the best intro to a um a tech review video that i've seen in a long
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.440]   time and it's not because i'm in it it's because anthony's incredible it's mostly because you're in
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.840]   it no it's a little it's a little you actually uh we're talking about because because
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:21.280]   microsoft has cortana and i feel like microsoft just kind of threw in the towel but there is some
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.360]   work to create interoperability isn't there
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:29.760]   yeah so this was part of that initiative uh the voice interop interopability initiative i think
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.480]   i'm pronouncing that right uh but i actually think this is a really interesting thing when we talk
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:40.160]   about agents and you know i'm not really into these agents as much i have a lot of devices i don't
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.280]   ever use them except for you know set a timer but whom i to deny the fact that these things are catching
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:51.840]   on so the question is now do we want a world where you know google would like to just be the one
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:58.080]   ai and agent to rule them all and that's obviously for convenience but the trade-off there is you
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.680]   basically have to give all your information to google and everything needs to be plugged in and
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:07.120]   the fact is even if you wanted to do that you couldn't like if you use a pc google has absolutely
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.560]   no access to that outside of your browsing history right um but if you don't use gmail or anything
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:18.240]   like that you know it does it's kind of useless so and also google doesn't do anything with amazon
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.800]   right in order to do those kind of services or it doesn't do much on your iphone so there's a lot of
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:28.480]   you know obstacles to being a one ai to rule them all things so what michael soft has been
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.120]   putting forward and now amazon is doing too is this idea like there shouldn't be a single
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.160]   agent because one it's too dangerous you're putting way too much personal information to one company
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:45.280]   and hopefully you know no one gets hacked instead they see a world where uh there's a multiple agents
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.080]   and every company basically has their own and they'll be standards there hopefully for security and
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.920]   privacy what we're talking about earlier and these agents said talk to each other and can feed off
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:01.840]   of each other and to me that seems like a more realistic kind of world so cortana you know people
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:06.240]   laugh at it you know obviously without a phone michael soft doesn't have much of a play there
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:12.400]   but they do have a play which is they they've put cortana under their office division so it's
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:18.480]   part of office 365 it's going to lengthen it's going to word outlook to do it's going to all
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.120]   their actual productivity services which when you look at what michael soft does best it's software
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:28.400]   and services and office has been one of the most successful parts of microsoft for decades now
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:34.240]   did you ever just clippy is that is that i mean i i mean if you think about it that's sort of
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.920]   where this is going but it's annoying is clippy that's for sure yeah well i mean i think this idea of
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:46.000]   like an agent being a physical representation i think that's going away right michael's got to kind
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.160]   of pull back on that and said you're just going to have machine learning and ai we'd throughout
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.440]   their operating system and through their services and you know that's going to be their strength so
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.920]   you'll be able to pull up calendars and appointments and that's what cortana is going to be doing if
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.760]   you're part of office 365 and microsoft that's something amazon has absolutely no they can't do
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:10.800]   anything there right and google can't do anything there and yet a lot of the world and business world
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.880]   it's it's microsoft so this is one way for these companies to cooperate basically and build products
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.600]   where they can you know work together currently you can do this you can actually ask a lot to open
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:27.040]   up cortana as a skill and it'll do that and then you can use cortana three-year-old device but
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:33.840]   it's a little bit of a it's a two two-steper right you gotta hey okay now open up cortana
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.400]   what this will do is you'll go to one wake word you could basically tell your life device open
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:44.880]   cortana and it'll just go directly and so it's this idea of you know reducing these walls and obstacles
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.920]   to these services and so sales force i believe is on board with this i think samsung was too
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.200]   qualcomm for hardware of horizon as well so all these companies are kind of jumping on board google
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.920]   said they just learned about it so they have a committed to it yet and we don't know about apple
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:05.360]   of course but like yeah i love people hate on syria actually like syria's user experience i
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.000]   actually think it's very good but like syria could benefit from this right just plug into other
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.120]   systems just like how your browser works now where you have extensions and we were kind of familiar
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.840]   with this idea that things plug into each other and should and you know be interoperable so
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:24.960]   that's what this project is for i think it's it's the smart way this industry goes forward to the
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.960]   next level where we can also bring up ideas of privacy security you know microsoft they'll say
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:36.880]   cortana it obeys the standards that they need for business and operating there which is super
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:40.800]   important and that's how all their products work together which is why they just don't open
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:46.320]   everything up to third parties so this is one way i think to go down that route and it's kind of
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.960]   an interesting one even though i feel like all this stuff is super it's very premature ai is not
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:57.040]   here yet right we're barely starting there that's why this stuff is so unimpressive in my opinion
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:03.840]   when you use voice assistance maybe someday i just what i don't want to do is say
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:12.000]   cortana can i talk to echo right right so that's the goal of this is to is so you don't have to say
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:19.280]   that but how would it know which uh say the right wayward oh i just say echo yeah or cortana and
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:23.360]   basically if you think about it then the hardware this is microsoft's problem right
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:28.560]   uh they try to build a cortana speaker with the uh harm and nobody why have it nobody wants it right
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:35.040]   and and so why go buy specific hardware that's tied to one ecosystem hard i mean it's one thing on
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:39.040]   a computer because you can have you have a lot of storage a lot of cpu it's nothing on a phone that's
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:46.160]   true where i mean it before they do that can they just allow me to set my own wake word so
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.440]   we don't have to do all this rigmarole i've been bleeping every time people say a lee xa on the
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:57.840]   show because we don't want to trigger somebody's home echo and have them buy a dollhouse by act
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:04.640]   you can't you do that with amazon you can kind of you can choose to work it's computer useless
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:13.120]   amazon which we use amazon useless or a lee xa but remember on the old moto x you could tell
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:17.040]   the moto x i i want my wake word to be where is jacuzzi
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.800]   jacuzzi well or yeah actually i mean mind help me he'll be one can i'll be because i thought
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.040]   that's never going to come up in the real world yeah but if but if i want help from my
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:30.960]   assistant saying help me he'll be one can i'll be he's kind of fun yeah sure and it's never going
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.040]   to get accidentally triggered unless it's a big crop with all of these i don't understand why
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:39.760]   they don't do this yet there's a lot of obstacles also you know we're just getting to the point
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:45.600]   right of actual voice recognition so if i ask something versus a friend or family member
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.360]   you know now they're getting to the point where oh it brings up your stuff right and
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.400]   mike shop wants to do that too so i go what's my appointment it knows me versus you know so to my
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:02.160]   family and so this stuff it has a long long way to go before it really becomes useful even
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:06.880]   conversational ai right mike yourself showed this off at build they bought a company called
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:12.880]   semantic machines and it's actually based here in boston and so they work on this idea of
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:19.760]   contextual ai what i mean by that is you have a conversation and so so there's follow-ups and
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:25.600]   the thing becomes more human-like right so that you can ask a follow-up question to it like right
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:30.800]   what's the weather for tomorrow is it going to rain on thursday and you can go back and forth to
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.520]   this without having to repeat the question so that stuff is just starting to come out but we're
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.600]   still got a long way before the stuff is super useful but i think in advance of that this idea
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:44.880]   of these companies working together i think is a lot smarter because we all benefit from that
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:49.840]   way it's a good swimmer eventually you just buy a speaker and it doesn't matter whose service is
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:54.480]   on there right uh you can use whatever you want and they're all tied together but everybody will
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:58.560]   have their strength and so that's gonna be i think really kind of cool yeah i want to have my own
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:07.440]   voice assistant i want scarlet joe hanzer mine will be named i'm thinking about who would you like
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:13.360]   a lot of jacksen yeah so jackson they didn't announce that ninety nine cents then it'll be five
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:20.160]   bucks unclear whether that's once or monthly hi i've got the samuel el jackson subscription
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:25.360]   you have to say that to you and it's clean and explicit right so you can have him saying i don't
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:33.440]   want no mr mr mf and uh timers said on me i don't want no mf and twerkin bear dancing to my tune
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:41.040]   or you could say i wouldn't like any bear to talk about i don't want that bad dancing it's
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:46.560]   tushy around me yes it actually turns into a bit of a british accent would buy the non explicit
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:53.360]   samuel el jackson the lamest person ever if i'm paying a buck i want the explicit one i want the
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:59.360]   samuel el jackson from that that spy movie the british spy yes the kingsmen the kingsmen the
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:07.040]   king's men yeah he's like big baddie he's got a list yeah he's a lisping nerd he's a lisping nerd
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:12.400]   yes he's like he's wonderful he's also a killer so wonderful and um who's the guy that looks like
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:17.760]   data facebook uh mark zuckerberg and you put them together you know that's how i remember mark's name
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:22.560]   i always say who's the guy who's like data that is how i think it's a lot the run space
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.680]   thing at the oculus his haircut was just so friggin did it have a notch it might as well have
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:31.760]   it was just so straight across we're gonna take a break i want to talk about the new facebook
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:38.480]   virtual reality world where we're all equal but we all have no legs no legs we're all equally
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.960]   no legs uh it's the weirdest thing i've ever seen in my life they announced that it all was at the
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:49.120]   you can't work with no legs oculus connect event we have a big announcement for you mica sergeant
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:56.240]   we do we do that okay well mica's got a new show ladies and gentlemen in fact i think
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:00.000]   we have the preview episode why don't we watch
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:09.440]   hello there i'm mica sergeant and i'm matthew kasanelli and we are excited to be bringing you a brand new
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:17.520]   show smart tech today we're going to explore and explain the fascinating world of the internet
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:23.440]   of things and everything in between i've got some uh smart bulbs hanging around the house and
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.760]   matthew i'm pretty sure you know a thing or two about automation right yes i do i've got
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:34.800]   series shortcuts ready to go for everything i possibly can so if you want to check out the
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:41.520]   nerdy sometimes confusing but always exciting world of a smart tech then you definitely want to
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:46.640]   stay tuned in fact you can subscribe right now on apple podcasts your favorite podcatcher
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.040]   or at twit.tv/stt
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:56.880]   there is no video on that because it's an audio only show it's one of the things we're going to
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:03.840]   start doing on twit is audio only shows because we noticed that mostly people listen i like doing
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:09.280]   video because it lets you see us even if you only watch every once in a while then you can have a
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:15.920]   visual but uh it's expensive it's uh complicated and adds a great deal to the complication of
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:21.520]   doing the show so audio will be easier and chances are some of your favorite podcasts are audio only
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:27.280]   almost all of them some very popular how many people do video podcasts nobody just you just me
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.400]   wow was a bad idea but uh we're not getting rid of video but just we're trying out when we do
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.400]   try out new shows we thought well we'll launch them in audio first yeah how about that so i'm
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.640]   really pumped about this uh i think that we are just finally i mean we just spent a whole
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.640]   segment talking about all these different voice assistants we're kind of on the bridge of uh
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:51.360]   folks understanding what smart tech is and so kind of the conversation we've just been having
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:57.600]   it's not just iot it's voices it's exactly it's all it's intelligent vehicles self-driving cars
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:05.440]   did you see people apparently tesla 10 oh my god i've loved this i was a new summon capability and
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:12.800]   people are starting to post videos the freakin this creepiest videos of these tesla's inching through
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:20.800]   crowded parking lots if it's not a good idea uh it's a dear chair what's gonna happen if that car
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:28.560]   hits something then what you know hilarious video that's it who do who do you blame you send a
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:35.600]   bill to elan no i think it's still your fault i don't know why anybody would even think about
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:43.440]   doing this i'll i'll show you one of them it create anyway smart tech today it's launching win
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:49.920]   it's launching monday october seven and it'll come out every monday yes so uh you can actually
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:55.360]   here's the thing this is kind of fun the thing that we're testing out um you know the youths the
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:01.680]   youths as it were yes are super into twitch and you know there are other people who love twitch and
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:07.680]   so we are actually going to be matthew kastanelli from uh berkeley me from right here in the petaluma
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:13.040]   studio we'll be broadcasting the show on twitch interacting with that audience so stay tuned for
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.520]   that because right now the twitch chat is but we're gonna open it up during that time we're gonna
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.240]   have people tuning in there and being able to comment will there be video i mean yes so you
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.840]   could watch it do it let them do it live and comment live and comment there so we are doing it at four
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:32.320]   p.m. pacific and the reason we're doing that is because that about hits the bridge either before
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:36.800]   you're starting to eat dinner or and you know depending on how far you go uh after you've eaten
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:42.000]   dinner so plenty or it's kind of a good time there for folks to be able to tune into the live stream
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.920]   on twitch and hang out with us so yeah we are both looking forward to that matthew is already
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:53.760]   a twitch streamer and youtuber and work that's gonna be fun worked on the short stuff team at
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:38:00.400]   app or before apple swallowed it up so yeah we're looking forward to it for sure and so you can
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:07.360]   check that out monday october seventh and he'll be here live in the studio with me uh for that first
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:14.720]   episode so yeah check out brand new show come into twitch smart tech today stt and we will create a
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:20.480]   uh a topic on the forums uh something to category in the forums because that's something else we
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:24.400]   wanted to mention there's still kind of in beta because i don't know if this i don't know how this
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:28.880]   is going to work uh twit dot community we've created forums a lot of people said we can't watch
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.800]   the show live so there's no point for the chat room we love the chat room it's a great way to interact
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:38.560]   with us while we're doing a show live even if if it's audio only but if you aren't watching live
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:42.720]   what do you do so that we've created the forums they're kind of an asynchronous way to participate
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:48.640]   and every show will have a a category every host will have a category uh there'll be place for you
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:53.760]   to talk amongst yourselves as well ask tech questions that's twit dot community it isn't open now
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:39:00.000]   uh for you to join but just understand it's it's early days yet we're still working on it and we've
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.720]   already decided to change the name because mica says backstage is confusing so we're just going to
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.240]   call it twit community i guess and i do want to clarify something because i'm seeing some questions
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:14.160]   here uh you you're saying live audio if it's just going to be a still picture on twitch no we will
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:19.840]   be streaming video to just we won't put out a podcast exactly there won't be a video podcast
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:23.840]   afterward you can just subscribe to the audience i don't think that's gonna hurt too bad but we'll
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:27.680]   see yeah so yeah you'll be actually be able to watch it not even just on twitch that's just where
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:32.160]   we're going to be paying attention so if you stream it from another streaming platform it'll be there
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.560]   it's just twitch is where we're trying to focus some of us so we're gonna still put it on the twit
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:41.920]   dot tv slash live stream oh okay yeah all right so live you'll be a bunch so this is a video there's
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:49.040]   a lot of them on the the tesla motors subreddit uh this was one that really irked me this is a car
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.800]   this is a model three this is a new capability where you're standing on the curb at the store
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:00.400]   the car is parked you press a button on your phone the phone tells the car where you are and then
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.800]   autonomously drives it through the parking lot makes me nervous it's making me really nervous and
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:13.840]   this is a crowded parking lot so there's other cars that oh geez just i think this is such a
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:20.880]   bad idea and i kind of amad that tesla released this feature it just does this seem like a good
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.000]   idea i mean it didn't hit anything no but there wasn't a lot moving oh wait there no this is
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.680]   complicated there's people there's other cars this one's very complicated i thought this was
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:35.840]   one this don't do this in a crowded parking lot what if you hit somebody i mean well the car is
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:41.680]   barely moving you're going like two miles down the avenue wouldn't you it just feel like it doesn't
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:48.080]   seem like it's gonna end well you should yes i mean to be fair people like falling asleep in teslas
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:53.200]   which is like it's good arguably because it's like okay you're preventing the car from crashing if
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:58.240]   someone is falling asleep then the car is still driving but here it's like i don't see what this
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:04.320]   is saving anybody from it seems like pure risk oh it's show off it's complete show-off stuff i
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:10.240]   had tesla for three years i never used summon once i didn't trust it this is a newer updated
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:16.640]   better summons i certainly would have done this uh this is getting the valuable data of of what
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.480]   happens yeah that's what they say it's stuff yeah this is valuable data
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:26.320]   but yeah what is this help how does this help well because if it's raining let's say it's raining
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:31.840]   and you don't you don't want to uh i don't know go get out and yeah the car can come take you
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:36.160]   out of your tramp you're really trying to think of something no i think it's a bad idea i want to
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.960]   be very quick so here's the thing though it almost doesn't matter because it's not we can talk about
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.360]   how to use it right now it's the fact is we're going toward autonomous vehicles and these are the
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:51.520]   first steps that we go there eventually cars aren't going to have drivers i mean tesla you know musk has
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:56.800]   come out and said they've already planned a model three that has no steering wheel right so like
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:02.240]   these things will eventually drive and that's how the future of cars is going to be in this country
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:08.160]   now we're still years from that right but these are the first steps so it's like i know it's risky
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:13.360]   but steering wheels i do feel like an old man here but i'm again it well i'll be an old man with
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:19.360]   you because that's horrifying i am again it Netflix youtube cuphead you can't use them while you're
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.760]   driving it won't engage but yeah the idea is when you're at a charging station and they're going to
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:28.640]   start putting free Wi-Fi at these stations but yeah when you plug in you can play a video game
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:34.320]   you can watch tv you can catch up on a movie um yeah they're literally just throwing in features
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:38.560]   almost because they can and that's what's kind of fun about it right so i was going to target in
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:44.800]   i think it was in san jose and walking past and in the parking lot there's like all of these teslas
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.520]   it's like are they about to do a procession what's going on here and then i came to understand that
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.000]   it was because there was a supercharger station and they're all waiting yeah they're waiting i thought
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.200]   there's not one close enough that they don't have to wait in this long line it was a very long line
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:04.400]   but they all had their little monitors up with whatever probably playing fart signal or whatever
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:10.320]   the game is so yeah they've got they've got the entertainment but i found that fascinating and
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:14.400]   certainly not something that i think i would want to do is like okay here's another thing i would
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:21.760]   sign up for like the tesla karaoke but can't because i don't have it facebook horizon all right they
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:28.320]   announce this it is it is to laugh caroline you're right they announced this at the facebook connect
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:35.440]   event it is a quote ever expanding vr world where you can explore play and create in extraordinary
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:40.480]   ways you're not just discovering a new world you're part of what makes it great wow if i had a facebook
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:47.120]   account i probably would sign up for the beta but before you get all excited let's watch this trailer
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:55.440]   video beyond our world there's another world so and it's right here she's in her kitchen
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:05.120]   and there she is not actual vr footage it's pulling out and you see she's walking without feet
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:15.280]   which puzzles so everybody doesn't have feet you and your best friend can also now her husband's
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:21.200]   cooking dinner while she's flying or an airplane with a mustache yeah as you do as one does this
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:26.480]   now the nice thing about the airplane you don't see the fact you have no legs okay
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:31.920]   i'm kind of there's the other person she's playing why does the airplane have wings
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:41.840]   yeah why he's not australia this is the feature i signed up for this is where you want to go to art
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:52.400]   class i just don't want legs oh i does this is this exciting caroline can you are you excited
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:59.360]   about this there are any uh amazon echoes of it so notice there's also no facebook cars
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:10.560]   yeah i think it's funny or it's not the meta vr it's still just weird i'll say though this is
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:18.240]   seems like a response for me uh you know microsoft bot bot alt space vr but they use with windows
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:24.720]   mixed reality and if you go on to alt space vr it's very similar to this this idea of a
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:33.280]   virtual reality community you create an avatar you walk around um we've it's also a very weird world
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:39.840]   i've gone in there and it's like mixed reality and virtual reality all this stuff is um i don't it's
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:45.440]   definitely not mainstream but yet when you go into these communities they're very busy like there's
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:50.960]   a lot going on in there and so the audiences that use this stuff are very hardcore into it and
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:56.800]   that's what's kind of interesting i as a i i don't use this stuff regularly i haven't worked into
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:02.240]   my daily workflow yet but they are interesting i feel like this is facebook's attempt because
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:08.080]   they couldn't buy alt space vr to basically go into this same kind of space they had they had a
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:13.120]   vr environment we played with it with the oculus rift when it first came out and it was not pleasant
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:17.040]   the part of the problem and i think the reason they don't have legs is because uh what they
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.480]   don't talk about notice the woman couldn't move around because they're currently there's no
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:26.960]   way you want to move around with a visor on that you can't see what you're walking into right make
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:34.080]   you say so all of these have some weird way of motivating uh like maybe you use the device to
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.360]   put down a thing and pull it right pull yourself towards it or you press a button that slides
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:43.680]   glides you forward so legs really don't make sense in that environment because you're not able to
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:49.760]   walk and they don't want you to walk they want you to float and stay stakes you are i don't know i
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:54.160]   we'll see you know what i'm saying i'd give it i don't want people to summon i don't want them
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:47:00.560]   to do vr i just want them to stay at home and talk to their amazon echoes you know what do you remember
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.520]   go ahead if you remember second life yeah i played a lot of it yeah so this just reminds me just a
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:11.360]   virtual reality version of that and i i feel like these ideas again they don't go mainstream but for
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:16.000]   some reason they're so persistent they keep coming back and i i i don't want to be there's because
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.520]   of science fiction well and also because people don't want to live their real lives no no it's
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:25.120]   people looking at ready player one and before that snow crash you'll see even since metaverse
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.600]   escape is an allodec and honestly that's what i think a lot of
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.440]   scientists and technologists are doing they're just trying to invent the future that they read
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:40.000]   about when they were kids don't you think okay but i think the way that it gets popular is because
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.560]   people are trying to do what they want to do it but it isn't popular what happened to second life
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:51.120]   it turned into a place for people that have weird virtual sex and yeah it just again see
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:56.000]   does that always comes back to it technology always comes back to that so you can buy
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:03.360]   i didn't but you could buy costumes nude basically nude suits that you're a naked avatar in second
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:10.240]   life do you have legs yeah you had everything all like actually this show is brought to you
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:14.720]   by cash fly how many how many years have you heard bandwidth for this week in tech is brought

[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:26.960]   bites a month through cash fly twit dot cash fly dot com uh i love this story well i don't love it but
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:34.480]   it's interesting story uh jailbreak community has announced checkmate a jailbreak that cannot be
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:40.960]   fixed don't don't don't apple can't turn back now it only affects devices through the a11 so it
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:47.120]   doesn't affect the last two years of iPhones or iPads but because it's a firmware hack very hard
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:53.760]   to do uh apple would have to release new firmware for all its phones something it can't do it it
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:58.240]   have to take them back in hardware and stuff so checkmate is what they call a permanent
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:06.080]   unpatable boot rom exploit that's a clever name for it checkmate with an eight well uh i don't
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:11.600]   recommend jailbreaking in general but if you have an older phone maybe this is a way to keep it alive
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:18.400]   maybe put some software on it that you want uh mess around mess around uh it's on github
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:24.480]   uh i you know i won't say exactly where but you can find it and uh it doesn't work on the last
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:32.960]   two chipsets and be buyer beware yeah the creator says there are still kinks to be ironed out on
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:38.080]   older devices like the 4s so what's that mean i don't even want to find out if you can
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:43.440]   follow that your 4s it will never work again yeah yeah remember jailbreak could be jailbrick
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:50.960]   keep that in mind but it's you know it's an engineering feat something to be admired
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:55.840]   from afar from afar with a stick yeah i wouldn't recommend using it 10 feet at least
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:52:02.720]   apple says some of those shows we're making those movies we're making for apple tv plus those
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:09.520]   are going to be in the movie theaters again people go to those so this is so fia copala directing
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:16.640]   bill murray in a new movie on the rocks it's going to be one of apple's first major theatrical
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:23.120]   releases it'll open in theaters first and then on apple tv plus that's always been a bone of
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:29.200]   contention hollywood uh doesn't remember uh he's steven spielberg didn't want roma to be nominated
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:34.640]   for an academy award he said only movies that had a theatrical release so netflix put it out i think
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:40.400]   for two weeks in theaters it's not an easy thing to do apple's gonna uh respond to that now do we
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:46.480]   get a free pass in our wallet apps no so we have to pay for it there you know if you just don't go
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:50.000]   see it it's gonna be a dumb nobody's gonna go see it because you can watch it at home and about it so
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.400]   very do you think they're just doing this for the sake of being able to be nominated for awards
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:01.840]   well on the rocks which stars rachita jones is a young woman reconnecting with her eccentric father
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:07.200]   guess who her eccentric father will be bill murray they're eyeing a mid-year release next year
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.480]   possibly following a premiere at a high profile event such as the can film festival
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:21.200]   hmm interesting there's bill murray acting eccentric with rachita jones i've never seen him do that
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:26.720]   it's a new thing it's kind of a stretch for bill he's such a talented actor
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:34.080]   i don't even know why i told you this story nobody seems to care sorry not one bit i'm sorry i
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:41.280]   tried apple's gonna make the mac pro in texas everything's bigger there the old mac pro is made in texas
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:48.320]   and this yeah this is straight from apple yes from tim apple actually tim apple says and i think
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:56.160]   it has a little bit to do with trade war with china pressure on apple to make stuff in the u.s
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:00.880]   and honestly if you're going to make something in the u.s make yours what will undoubtedly be the
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:07.840]   slowest selling but it's going to start at six thousand dollars minus a monitor stand right
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:12.320]   you don't even get a monitor stand with that so or a movie ticket to go see their films you don't get
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:18.800]   nothing so it's good for austin it's good for the flex plant in austin which hasn't had a lot to do
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:26.800]   frankly since 2013 that's this is on top of the stuff that it's doing with corning where it just
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:33.520]   invested a bunch of money yeah apple has a fund uh to put money into some of the suppliers apple
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.200]   never says that they're using gorilla glass mm-hmm except it it comes from corning yeah and what
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:45.760]   happens i was told by a reliable source maybe you or rene somebody told me that what happens is
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:51.600]   apple puts it in their new iphone they don't call it gorilla glass and then after a decent
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:57.040]   period of time corning releases it as the next generation of gorilla glass well i don't think
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:02.320]   mine's gorilla glass because i remember that you break it already no no no you better not i did i
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:07.040]   didn't i just have a big gouge in this oh he does yeah it came with a game it's hard to see you can't
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:11.840]   see if it came with a guess i swear i swear it did when i pulled this phone out of the box
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:18.080]   a i looked at and there were some like there are these weird scratches all over the surface of it
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:23.920]   that gouge at the gouge was not there but it is there now and i i take very good care of my devices
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:30.000]   i don't put them next to metal things or let a torquing bear hold them i'm very careful actually
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.960]   they're missing a bet there should be an iphone stand attached to the butt of that torquing bear oh my
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:40.560]   gosh that would be perfect maybe burkel make me one he said he was already offering to make clothing
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:46.400]   yeah so a nice iphone stand for the torquing bear would be i mean look at that that's perfect
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.200]   one quick break and then we will wrap up with a a bunch of uh small
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:57.840]   have a mint that's good a small stories to wrap the day up but first a word from worldwide
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:03.600]   technology wwt we call them their advanced technology center started about 10 years ago
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:10.880]   it has grown like topsy more than half a billion dollars in equipment enterprise equipment so that
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:18.320]   you and they can test hardware and software before you deploy it the engineers at wwt use the advanced
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:26.000]   technology center to create tests proof of concept pilots they use the sandbox so the customers can
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:32.320]   see this stuff at work can see how it interacts with their equipment but one of the things i love
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:39.040]   about this i think is so amazing is that now you can use the atc as well even if you're not in
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:49.440]   st. louis every any time of the day or night you can try a test things at 24/7 in their on-demand
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:54.880]   labs schedulable labs representing the newest advances in all kinds of enterprise technology
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:57:01.040]   multi-cloud architecture security networking primary and secondary storage data analytics
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:05.200]   ai devops learn about the products before you launch
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:13.040]   test it reducing the concept time from months to weeks speed to markets faster they call it lab
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:19.600]   as a service lass it's a dedicated lab space within the atc where customers themselves can do
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:26.960]   programmatic testing using that vast technology ecosystem the half billion dollar atc it's amazing
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:31.440]   it's virtual and the time is finally here they launched it and they invite you to try it
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:38.160]   it creates a multiplier effective knowledge speed and agility anytime anywhere around the
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:43.280]   world for your wwt's customers you get access to articles you get case studies you get hands on
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:49.360]   labs you get other tools that make the difference in today's fast-paced world to learn more about
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:56.720]   worldwide technology and to join the atc ecosystem go to wwt.com/twit create your count try it out today
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:05.840]   wwt simplifies the complex wwt.com/twit worldwide technology delivering business and technology
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:14.320]   outcomes around the world hence the name worldwide technology and the atc there is some google
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:23.520]   news big landmark a case in europe in the right to be forgotten so there was google went to court
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:29.520]   in france saying look you can have right to be forgotten in the EU but that shouldn't extend to
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:38.000]   all countries worldwide that's a EU issue france said no we want if you the cnil which is france's
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:45.360]   private the privacy regulator in 2015 said no you have to globally remove search result listings
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:50.880]   if there's damaging or false information about a person everywhere globally not just france
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:58.640]   so what google's response the next year was to block european users from seeing links that were
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:03.600]   delisted elsewhere it says that we don't want to censor it but at least we'll block it
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:10.800]   and then went to court and it looks like the european court of justice which sounds like a
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:17.600]   marvel comic universe event the european court of justice says currently google does not have to
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:23.440]   dereference all versions of its search engine if if a right to be forgotten request has been made
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:29.360]   just in the right to be forgotten country that's actually a big deal for the internet working
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:37.600]   period yeah and you may remember that also in the EU publishers in the EU did not like google's
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:44.560]   use of snippets in their search results honestly that's a big part of why google search works the
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:49.760]   publisher said well they'll read that one sentence summary of the story they don't go to our and
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:54.240]   they won't click the link they'll just say okay i got what i want and they won't it won't drive
[01:59:54.240 --> 02:00:02.640]   traffic every time that that has been blocked as it was in spain it's resulted in decline of traffic
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:10.000]   to those sites it's going to happen now in france google will stop showing new snippets from european
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.120]   publishers on search results for its french users this is the new european copyright law we
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:20.000]   warned against this law this is a very problematic law i don't want to say something controversial
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.200]   but if you're going to say something about cheese eaters i'm i'll be mad i have no idea what that
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:30.080]   means okay i feel like the EU just really doesn't understand the internet i think that's not controversial
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:36.960]   at all i have to look the gdpr is a good thing the gdpr is a good thing yeah but this new copyright
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:41.200]   regulation we knew would be a problem this there's one of two problems one is a snippet issue the
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:48.320]   other one is uh memes meme basically prevent memes but memes are the smallest amount of it it basically
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:53.280]   says that uh any publisher is responsible for making sure copyright is not being violated so
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:58.400]   we have a new forum if somebody posts something copyrighted on that forum it's my responsibility
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:04.320]   to prevent that from happening which means it's twitter's responsibility it's everybody yeah and
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:09.120]   in europe that means it's it's going to be a chilling effect on free speech because most
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:15.760]   networks can't be blocked they're just going to block everything right so uh french users will
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:22.080]   only see headlines not the first few lines or a thumbnail image for news content unless the publisher
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:28.400]   asks for it oh so it's opt-in it's opt-in on the publisher side spain did this uh germany did this
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:35.440]   uh in spain google news pulled out traffic to axel springer the german publisher plunged after
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:40.880]   it sought to block the search engine we talk a lot about this on our wednesday show this week in
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:47.520]   google jeff javis always says look these newspapers have to understand google drives traffic right
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:53.120]   that's how good folks find things yeah uh i i don't understand i mean i i get the because there have
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:58.400]   been times where i've typed in something and it's like oh this is exactly what you need to do and
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:02.480]   it'll say the first sentence and then step one through seven and i'm like i don't ever have to
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:08.640]   go click on that article so i understand the concern there but in many cases it doesn't provide
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:14.880]   all of the information that i need or i start to see a trend of like every time i google this one
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:18.720]   site is telling me the things that i need to know so then you start to trust that site you start to
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:25.280]   go to that site etc and yeah if that's not there then how will we know that those sites are out there
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.960]   this is the whole point daniel carolina you're suffering low blood sugar i know it's dinnertime
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:35.920]   i don't want you to pass out let's take a break go get a snack have a drink of orange juice maybe
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:43.200]   a baby Ruth bar and orange juice are you okay i'm great i know blood sugars and issues sometimes it
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:47.840]   is well actually maybe i should have some orange juice there you go look at caroline's having a
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:53.760]   nice beverage i've got a mint in my water oh all right do we care that quest love is moving
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:59.120]   his podcast from pandaure to i heart radio you know i do care no you don't know i don't even know
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:04.640]   who i still have this that's that's a that's neither drama he's the drummer on the uh
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:11.120]   the letterman show no he's on the roots yeah he's in the roots on the fowlan show oh he's on uh he's
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:18.240]   with fowlan it's late night yes he is not late night to night the night some night so this is actually
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:23.600]   a blow for panda pandaure because they were starting podcasts i guess this is kind of inside baseball
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:28.080]   it's a little bit but i don't know i see people jumping all over the places but the fact is the
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:34.640]   jumping in the first place because i think about to me podcasting is not a siloed right thing what
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:40.560]   does it mean can i not hear it anymore yeah so do i have to pay to to hear it does he get other sort
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:46.000]   of well it turns out you'll be able to listen to podcast on anywhere else so then what is it what
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.680]   does this even mean maybe it's just exclusively not on pandaure not on pandaure you get everywhere
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:56.960]   but you can't let's do it on pandaure and i'm sure quest love got a big i also am jumping from pandaure
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:03.120]   i am too let's all jump let's jump from pandaure sorry pandaure does anybody use pandaure anymore i still
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:08.640]   have an active subscription i actually enjoy pandaure but does that cost kind of risk is that rude it's
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:12.640]   like fifteen dollars nine nine cent i think it was like a dollar or something like that month or something
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:16.640]   yeah or there's like there's different levels i mean there's two different levels i got it's still
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:22.000]   20 bucks i got it from a guy on the street he said i'll sell you a little car yeah give me a pandaure
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.800]   card so you spotify his pandaure in 2012 i was going through this phase oh yeah when you were a kid
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:34.000]   it was a phase yeah okay let me guess okay um spotify right yeah yeah yeah spotify
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:41.280]   spotify right and apple music apple music well that's my problem is i can't i can't
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:45.440]   quit any of them i've apple music google music spotify i don't do the google one that's too many
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:50.560]   you know that for the youtube apps you know what i just did this is new amazon hd now they have
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:56.160]   high res music on amazon unlimited music unlimited i just listened to the show it's called ask the tech
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:05:02.480]   guy and on it uh there is this guy and he was talking about how you really can't uh how many
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:06.640]   people really can't tell the difference especially high fidelity for over 30 especially for a certain
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:10.480]   age can't tell the difference between high fidelity music and regular fidelity music only five bucks
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:17.280]   more a month oh my god leo loport i have it's that's for those audiophile people who i get them i
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:25.280]   respect their skills they're also annoying and i hate them because they just always chime in on
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:29.120]   everything and they push up the glass and they're like well actually actually it's just like you
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:35.920]   come on oh are you a savage listening to 16-bit yeah exactly oh recordings what's wrong with you
[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:43.520]   yeah no song can be resampled at 44 100 cycles per second that's just not reasonable
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:50.000]   i think most sound is basically fine if i can hear it it's like honestly okay you guys are all
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:57.040]   young i'm old but nobody you're listening on those little white air pod things okay don't
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:03.040]   don't insult me it's stuff you can't it doesn't there's not the most a lot of i shouldn't say
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:06.640]   most a lot of people you're right they're listening to the things they got in there
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:11.120]   came with the phone it's a came with the phone is probably not that good right and i listen to
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:16.400]   punk music which already sounds bad yeah what does it sound bad exactly i like okay but
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:22.240]   yeah i listen to pink floyd all right yeah let's throw on you know give me the 7.1 and all that stuff
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:26.640]   but otherwise i will say there are some Beyonce songs that do some there are still people listening
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:32.240]   to music on twerking bears i just want to say that's true yeah i don't plan to even know where the
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:38.320]   speaker is in this thing there isn't one as a matter of fact it's in one cylinder yeah it doesn't
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:44.000]   it doesn't don't go looking for that speaker my god are the eyes cameras oh my god are you listening
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:52.800]   to me jimmy come on oh man let's see what else um
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:07:00.000]   snapchat has been collecting information on facebook's bad behavior the only reason i like
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:06.400]   this story is because they call their dossier project Voldemort and that face that they chose
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:12.000]   that's perfect thank you r's technica for choosing they really just need to take the nose out and
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:18.000]   it's perfect now instead of data i'll say lord that's an interesting point like grumpy cat rest in
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:23.680]   peace oh rest in peace sweet preacher i wish i could uh it will illustrate this just take the
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:28.560]   nose out yeah you got to like a real photoshop challenge you've got a few minutes before the
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:36.560]   show's over please if you can post it on twitter at leo loport mark succerberg i mean i can probably
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:43.440]   this image nose just use the uh healing tool yeah i can heal the nose i'm gonna heal away the nose
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:50.400]   heal the nose ladies and gentlemen as you do um i love harry potter references i know i wonder if
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:58.000]   facebook has a dossier got snapchat called i don't know project snape i mean snap that would be truly
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:04.560]   deranged snapchat is no much is not much better than facebook is it i like this one well two
[02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:10.080]   two proposals by uh elizabeth warren uh i know we don't like to talk about politics but actually
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:16.720]   this is an important one first of all she says we should hire an army of nerds okay wait is that
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:22.640]   the quote i like it already to defeat google's not lobbyists yeah and the army of nerd she's
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:28.240]   talking about is actually a big deal the office of technology assessment nuke gingrich killed this
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:36.800]   20 years ago this was a real i think a very valuable uh group designed to help congress
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:41.760]   understand technology if you complain that your member of congress doesn't get technology and you
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:49.440]   would be right to uh we need to bring back the office of technology assessment established in the
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:57.680]   70s to give nonpartisan informative information about science and technology to members of congress
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:05.120]   so they could vote appropriately gingrich led a successful effort to dissolve it's in the 90s
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:11.600]   warren says we need to reinstate and i know many others who agree the ota to help lawmakers
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:19.200]   grapple with policy issues that are increasing and so what you're seeing is ill-informed
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:24.400]   members of congress going after google and facebook give them some you know information
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:30.320]   so i mean internet's like a series of whites yeah it's not much better i mean
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:36.560]   like that when they were when they were talking uh to zuckerberg last year
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:42.400]   senator roy blunt bragged about putting his facebook address on his business cards
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:46.720]   hatch question the company's business model or an hatch resulting in the
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:53.600]   senator our business model we run ads remark from mark zuckerberg they need to know more
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:57.600]   they need to know more they need to be better informed so i like that they need this far i mean
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:02.320]   there's already a science advisory group right but no take some seriously unfortunately but
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:07.600]   like the government totally needs this because like yeah these people making these decisions
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:13.600]   about technology are just really kind of clueless and listen i get it you get certain age you're
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:18.080]   busy you can't keep up with this up that's totally fine that everybody needs to be an expert on this
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:23.280]   stuff but i mean they should absolutely be listening to people or at least getting advice from people
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:28.400]   who do this for a living and have some input on it because they're legislating on it and it's
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:34.160]   totally crazy even the fcc stuff lately has been totally off the wall and so there needs to be
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:39.440]   cooperation between the industry and government without lobbyists throwing money around who are
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:44.880]   clearly influencing these decisions completely agree i completely agree i just know if i have
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:51.040]   to watch one more congressional hearing and there's a senator that asks how do i log into my facebook
