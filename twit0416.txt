[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.680]   my left in studio.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.480]   It's so nice to finally meet Dan Benjamin of the 5x5 network.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.600]   I've been following Dan for a long time.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   When did you start 5x5?
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   About 2009.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   It's been a long time.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   What was your first show?
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.840]   The first show that I did was an interview show called The Pipeline and then I did.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.000]   Still doing it.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.120]   Still doing occasionally and I did another one called The Conversation.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.840]   What prompted you to get into my space?
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.160]   In two years.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.760]   You know I'd been doing podcasts on and off for a while since like maybe 2005, 2006.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.400]   And I, you know, I was at a place where I had been like a CTO of some tech startup in
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.640]   San Francisco and I didn't like that and I loved but I loved doing the podcast.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.640]   It was so much fun.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.920]   I always wanted to be in radio and TV and that was my major for a little while.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   I'm really college.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920]   Interesting.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920]   Until they talked me out of it.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.480]   It was a wise move.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   That's what everyone says.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.320]   So I actually was like I did software development and I did IT and I did that stuff for a long
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.760]   time but I always wanted in my heart to do, you know, to do radio and I read a piece on
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   you in the New York Times.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.120]   It was talking about what you guys were doing and the success that you'd had coming from,
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.280]   you know, you're leveraging radio and doing it like this.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.240]   And I thought, well, if, you know, if he's able to build this whole business, like I
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.040]   can pay my mortgage, right?
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.880]   So that's what I started out to do.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.920]   And I brought this sort of separate shows together into one umbrella and you're doing
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920]   more than that now.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920]   You have how many shows?
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.600]   30, almost 30, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 42.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.080]   Can you stop now?
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   No.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   I can't.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   Can you stop?
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   No, it's what happens.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.640]   You go, I can do a couple more.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.440]   I'll do a few more, but you're doing more than I am.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   We don't do that many.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.440]   I think we do 35.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.200]   I'm nervous about doing too many because it's confusing, I think.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.600]   I look at revision three and they had so many shows.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.520]   I couldn't figure out what they were doing anymore.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.520]   Right.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.480]   I mean, the problem is people come and they get to the page or they get to the site or
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.840]   they look at an iTunes and there's so many different shows.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   Which one are they supposed to go to?
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.960]   So it's kind of an ongoing challenge to figure that out.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.400]   Also here, I'm so glad he's here.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.480]   Tim Stevens, formerly editor in chief of Engadget, now automotive racer.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.360]   Doing lots of things, whatever suits my fancy at the moment.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.680]   I'm getting my car back ready for race and having some good conversations with folks.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.880]   I just got my own blog spun up again.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.840]   So yeah, I'm just kind of taking it easy for a little long.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.840]   Digitaldisplacement.com.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.800]   And as Dan pointed out, observed you haven't blogged since September 2008.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.000]   So welcome back.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.360]   I shut that down when I got to Engadget back in the summer.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.720]   And I haven't had a chance to post anything since then.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.640]   So yeah, I thought I'd go ahead and post some stuff up there in the interim and then
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.480]   again, we'll see where the wind takes me from here.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.120]   So what happened at Engadget?
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.640]   There's not a lot that I can, I should say at this point.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.120]   But suffice to say, I'm no longer with Engadget.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.240]   It's been about two weeks now since I stepped away from there.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.640]   And yeah, I just ended up having a lot of good conversations with a lot of people.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.600]   There's thankfully, I'm happy to say a lot of interest in what I was able to do there.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.160]   And so I'm looking forward to seeing what the next chapter is.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.200]   Well, I've always been a huge fan and we will continue to have you on any time you want
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.160]   it because you're just great.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   And I wish you luck.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   I'm sure you'll end up somewhere that you want to.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.240]   But meanwhile, if you follow him on his vlogger and his Google+, he's having fun working on
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.480]   the cars, fixing them up.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.400]   When's your next race?
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.440]   My next race is the middle of August going down to Lime Rock actually for Dave autocrossing.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.440]   Wow.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.440]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.880]   It's nice to have a little free time.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.560]   I got to say, I wish somebody's fired me.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.240]   I cannot wait just to take it as he looks around for nobody can fire me.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.480]   It's terrible.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.840]   So and I'm not saying you were fired, Tim.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.160]   I don't know what happened and we're not we're not guessing.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.640]   And I know you can't probably for legal reasons, say what happened, but I'll just keep smiling.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   Their loss.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   Let's put it that way.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   Thank you.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.640]   So I am really happy.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.360]   I have two things in my hot little hand that Google announced on Wednesday.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.880]   This is the Nexus 7 2013 edition.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.680]   And I didn't even want to I like it so much.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.920]   I didn't take it off my TV.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.840]   I have the crumbcast at home.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.320]   I wanted to I didn't want to take it off the TV.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.440]   It was kind of a surprising announcement on Wednesday because well, this had leaked out.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.160]   The Nexus 7 had fully leaked out.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.720]   Everybody everybody knew that's what you know, the invitation was breakfast with Sundar
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   Pachai, kind of a casual laid back thing.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.640]   Not a lot of people were invited.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.640]   They did stream it.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   Thank goodness.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.520]   They were invited, but at 9 AM, they we were able to turn on the stream and watch.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   And nobody was really surprised because it had been a year since the original Nexus
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   7.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.160]   It was due for a refresh.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.040]   In hindsight, we maybe should have paid more attention to this because this Nexus 7 turns
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.680]   out to be a pretty big deal.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:04.800]   But then they clobbered us with crumbcast, which nobody had well, I guess we kind of
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.400]   knew there was going to be a Google TV something.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   But what a shock.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.120]   Let's start with crumbcast and we'll get back to the Nexus 7.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.320]   Were you surprised by this?
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.440]   Yeah, I mean, this is the kind of thing that you want Google to kind of come out with something
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.000]   that surprises you at this point because their other offerings have been kind of, you know,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.600]   when they did little experiments with a little ball that had the...
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.680]   Well, this is the successor to the queue, which was...
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   They never even tried to sell it.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.160]   It was such a horrible idea.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160]   But so you've got this thing and this is plugged in.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   You're using this now.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   Right.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   Your house.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.880]   So to me, it's more potential than reality, right?
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.000]   So right now, Tim, do you have a crumbcast?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Did you get one?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.040]   No, I did not get one, but I've been reading about it closely.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.500]   And interestingly, we actually had pictures at Engadget of this guy about two months
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.500]   ago.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   Oh interesting.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.720]   But we didn't know what it was and we didn't actually see the port end of it.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.040]   We only saw the other end of it.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.160]   So we were trying to figure out what a chrome USB key would be.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.760]   We were thinking maybe it was like Chrome OS on a USB key that you could plug in and
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.760]   run from anywhere.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.360]   But we couldn't connect all the dots so we didn't run with it.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   But now it's interesting to see that it's actually an HDMI port on the end, not a USB
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.360]   port.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.160]   It looks like a thumb drive with a bold.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   That's what it was.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.840]   Instead of the USB port though, there's an HDMI port.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   On the other end, there's a micro USB port.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.000]   You do need that for power.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.720]   It is not an MHL.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   I verified this.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.200]   It's not an MHL HDMI port.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.800]   So you can't power it from an MHL port.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:34.120]   But that means it works with every HDMI television or monitor.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.480]   It is in its conception, maybe a little confusing.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.280]   You might look at that and say, "Oh, that must be an Android USB stick.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   It's not."
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.720]   Apparently runs Chrome OS and supports a protocol called Dial, which is not new.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.080]   In fact, as far as I can tell, and we were just talking with our assistant, Bear, who
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.200]   has looked kind of into it, it is pretty much open through and through.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.400]   They've offered an API and an SDK.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.160]   They really did it in a very interesting way.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.480]   They slowly revealed how open it was.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.640]   At first, it sounded like, "Oh, this is just going to be a Google Play music playing device."
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.120]   Then they said, "We've got to deal with Netflix."
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   "Oh, okay."
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   So they had a partnership.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.160]   Then they said, "And maybe, Pandora's coming.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.440]   Okay, we have two partnerships."
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.520]   It's open and we're going to be an API and SDK and anybody could Chromecast enable anything.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.680]   That's when I thought this could be a deal changer.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.480]   The biggest story is it's $35 and for about three seconds came with three months of Netflix.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.080]   Then a million people bought them and that was the end of that.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.240]   Yeah, I think they must have had a deal with Netflix that said something like, "We'll give
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   a million."
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.920]   A million is the number that leaves to mind.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.480]   "We'll give a million people three months free of Netflix."
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.280]   Even if you're an existing customer, by the way, I was able to extend my subscription
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.200]   by three months.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.760]   And then they sold a million.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.720]   They said, "Oh, oops."
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.000]   So literally within a couple of days, they said, "No more, that's it."
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.520]   It's still at 35 bucks a good deal, but it was an amazing deal when you got $24 within
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.800]   Netflix.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:13.720]   So here's why I'm excited about it because on the surface, all it really does is, and
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.840]   the first thing is it's not a streamer.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:23.880]   So Apple TV with AirPlay or even now AirPlay on Mountain Lion going to an Apple TV, you take
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.680]   what's on your screen, squish it down, send it via Wi-Fi to the Apple TV, which then
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.480]   plays on the device.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.600]   The Chromecast can do that.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.840]   They say that's in beta.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.040]   It could take any tab from Chrome if you have the extension and play it.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.120]   So it could be a web page, it could be video.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.480]   But that's not what it's primarily supposed to do.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:50.800]   What it does is this dial handoff where the device, and it could be a laptop running Chrome,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:57.360]   Android phone, Android tablet, and soon iOS, not yet, but soon iOS, if you run Netflix,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.480]   for instance, on an Android, I was able to get my iPad to work with Netflix.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.880]   Oh, so Netflix has been updated for iOS.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.840]   So the key is that the app developer has to update their app.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.560]   So what happens when you run Netflix, I'll do it on the Nexus 7, is if there's a Chromecast
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.000]   device on the Wi-Fi network, there's a Chromecast button on Netflix.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.400]   You go to Netflix, you browse it, you find your movie, then you press the Chromecast
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.040]   button, it says, which Chromecast?
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   So you can have multiple Chromecast in the house.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.000]   You say, I want the one in the living room.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.920]   And then when you play the movie on Netflix on your tablet, it signals the Chromecast,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.480]   okay, he wants to play this movie.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.080]   The Chromecast does the work.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.960]   It maintains a connection with the device for control, playback, rewind, fast forward,
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   and volume.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.960]   But you could turn the--
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.400]   So it's not streaming from your device.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   It's not.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   You could turn the device off.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.960]   This was actually one of the frustrations that we had with the Nexus Q because that device
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.400]   couldn't actually play any content from your local network.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.160]   And it seemed like that would be something that people would want to do on that device,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.720]   since it would be a high quality audio device.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.160]   But it couldn't actually play from your local network, which for a $300 audio streamer was
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.160]   a bit of a bummer.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.400]   But obviously for $35, definitely willing to overlook that.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.920]   So Chaz pressing the Chromecast button there on his Android phone, he sees Chromecast 7207.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.800]   You can rename that.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.040]   And it's now going to go to that Chromecast and play.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   Does this with YouTube?
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.880]   Right now, YouTube, Google Play to Google Properties, Netflix, as soon Pandora.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.720]   But we've already talked to Houdini7, the developer of the Twit app, for instance.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.800]   He says he's enabling it on the Twit app.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:37.360]   So you'd be able to launch the Twit app, press Chromecast, and then play through the Chromecast.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.800]   Can you stream from a device, though?
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   You can.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.760]   You can stream any Chrometab, which means a web page or video.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.880]   But it's got limitations, 720p maximum video.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.880]   And you have to compress it a lot, and you have to send it through the Wi-Fi.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.360]   So yes, it can do that.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.280]   But I don't think it's primarily what it is.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.080]   What's interesting is that it's an open platform.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.480]   So what will really determine whether this, I think it's worth $35 just for those things.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.720]   But what will really make this a value is if other companies, for instance, I'm dying
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.280]   to see Amazon put this on Amazon streaming.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.280]   Definitely.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.600]   Then it then, that's huge.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.000]   That single thing would make it a huge.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.400]   Well, just having a device that you could do Amazon and Netflix.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.000]   And Apple will make iTunes Chromecast compatible with Chromecast.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.560]   I'm not in the future.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.160]   I think we can pretty much bet on that.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.840]   I'm a bit bummed that they didn't add in Miracast support.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.440]   Google made a big deal about adding Miracast support right into the OS in Android 4.2.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.720]   And they said they were going to spread it across their devices.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.040]   But ultimately, we haven't really heard anything about Miracast.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   What is Miracast?
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   It's 4.2.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.440]   Miracast is basically the successor of Wi-Fi director, basically rebranding of it.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.480]   So it's a wireless video over HDMI.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.400]   So it's compatible with laptops and with a lot of other devices too.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.120]   And it would have made this an even more powerful, more useful device.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.640]   So you can also connect your laptop to it and stream any video from it.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.840]   You could run presentations on it.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.080]   You can do anything you want to.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.840]   I hope Google will add that into this.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.200]   And if it's running Chrome OS, they certainly could with too much trouble.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.520]   But since that Google hasn't really talked about it since they added 4.2, I would have
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.000]   liked to see it added in here.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.200]   But again, with $35, I can't complain too much.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:22.040]   Yeah, I mean, when you talk about the price, then it's such a no-brainer given the price.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.680]   For $100, it doesn't compare well with Roku or Apple TV.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   Right.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.880]   It doesn't do what they do.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.960]   It's not as sophisticated.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.520]   But $35, it's almost an impulse purchase.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.080]   That totally is.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.640]   And then there's a few people who are listening to the show who can't come up with $35 to
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.520]   spend to just try something like this.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.560]   Now, are you saying that this thing is good enough right now?
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.640]   Do you think that somebody who's thinking, "Should I get an Apple TV?
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.640]   Should I get a Roku?"
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   That's a good question.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.640]   Should I get this?
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.640]   Is it in line with those as far as--
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.520]   I would wait and see how third party support is.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.560]   There's rumors that there's HBO Go is working on it.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.560]   And that would make sense.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.560]   That would be huge.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.560]   That would be huge.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.560]   And why not?
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.760]   Why wouldn't NFL--
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.920]   -- would be a major league baseball.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920]   Why wouldn't--
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.120]   They have to be in the NBA.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.480]   They, of course, if it's easy--
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.440]   and I gather it's fairly easy.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.920]   It's open.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.920]   Why wouldn't you do it?
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.040]   So I've got-- and especially since now we know it sold quite well, it's out of stock
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040]   everywhere.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.360]   Now, they could have had 50,000 units.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   Who knows?
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.360]   Now, this is only direct from Google where you were getting this or could you--
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.360]   No, I got it on Amazon.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.360]   That's how I got it so fast.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.680]   They had Amazon overnight.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.400]   Same thing with the Nexus 7.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.840]   Staples, Best Buy, other big box stores had it apparently.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.360]   But they're all sold out.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.120]   They're all sold out.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.120]   But I think we've seen this before.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.320]   That doesn't mean anything.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   We don't--
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.320]   -- anything.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.400]   Then anybody who has an Android data streaming video will probably update their app very soon
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.520]   and ultimately make it compatible with this.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.360]   So I would think that anything that's already on Android will be playable through this in
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.760]   the very near future, probably within a few months.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.840]   And that right there would be a huge suite of functionality.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.280]   If you don't have one of the newer smart TVs and you aren't really looking to buy a new
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.920]   TV, this is a great way to add that functionality.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.040]   It's in many ways a better experience than a smart TV.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.000]   I mean, I've tried every smart TV.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And they're all clunky.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.560]   Yeah, they're getting better.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   But they're still a long way to go.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.680]   And nothing is as easy to use as Android.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.160]   I mean, not that Android is a fantastic experience, but it sure be.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.240]   It's kind of clicking through menus with your remote control on your TV.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.360]   You can swipe through it, especially because you could be watching TV while you're selecting
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.040]   the next thing to watch on your tablet, which right there is a real nice experience.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.200]   So here's what I did this morning.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   I'm lying in bed.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.080]   I got my Nexus 7.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.920]   I have an app that communicates with my AV receiver where the Chromecast is plugged in.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.200]   Because you have-- it will support CEC.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.440]   So if you have it on a CEC port on your TV, it will automatically change to the right
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.440]   input.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.080]   Otherwise, you have to change the AV receiver to that input.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.400]   So I did that.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.680]   I launched Google Play.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.560]   I started a radio stream and I sent it to the stereo.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.560]   And I'm listening to the music.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.960]   It sounds great.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.880]   It's 1080p on Netflix.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.840]   Just for those two things alone, I'm happy.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.840]   35 bucks.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   35 bucks.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   I'm happy.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.160]   And I did get three months in Netflix.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.840]   By the way, there's been some question about if you bought more than one, and many people
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.840]   did apparently.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.840]   I bought five.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.840]   Sorry.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   I bought yours.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.840]   Sorry.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.480]   I didn't know it ran out so fast.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.760]   But I gathered when I applied the first code and I tried to apply the second and said,
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.240]   you can't have consecutive codes running.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.920]   But I gathered that I could probably wait three months and apply the second one.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.640]   So I think I'm going to have 15 months free in Netflix.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   Nice.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.120]   Did you see that there's already been an exploit on this thing?
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.120]   No, they hacked it?
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   Yeah, there's a link that I found on Engadget.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.520]   This only took a couple days for it to be exploited.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   That's right.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.080]   Yes.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.640]   But if you want, there's a site called GTV Hacker that explains how to do it.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.760]   And it confirms the software within is not Chrome OS.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.960]   It's described as a modified Google TV release, but with all the Bionic, the Bionic Dalvik
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.720]   stripped out and replaced with a single binary for Chromecast.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   Oh, interesting.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   Very interesting.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   It's not.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.120]   They kind of implied it was Chrome OS.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.960]   Yeah, I thought that's what it was.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.600]   So very interesting.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.280]   When you say hacked, do they mean maliciously or just--
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.160]   I think you can get a root shell on port 23.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.000]   Now you can investigate what it's actually doing.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.160]   All right, I'm doing it.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.800]   I've got a shell open on my TV.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.200]   GTV Hacker.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.480]   Yeah, I think this is a big product from Google.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.480]   I mean, somebody pointed out that, of course, this means Google can watch everything you
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.760]   watch.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.280]   I don't really care.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.960]   And I guess if you don't, you shouldn't use it.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.080]   If you do, you shouldn't use it.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   But presumably--
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.240]   Well, Netflix can see most of the stuff we watch in Amazon.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.560]   You're ISP can.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.120]   I mean, everybody can.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.440]   So who cares, right?
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.440]   People really care about that.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440]   They do.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.960]   Like they really don't want anyone knowing--
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.520]   You know, what movie they watched on Friday night.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.800]   Like it really bothers people for some reason.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   I don't know why.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.400]   Like, is that-- because they're learning our habits.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.880]   Well, so they're watching everything we search for.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.040]   You're using the internet.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.440]   So everyone knows everything.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.080]   No secrets anymore.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.800]   Google says they're going to continue to do a Google TV.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.040]   They say, this is not Google TV.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.760]   And they're going to continue to do Google TV, which nobody buys anyway.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.280]   So who cares?
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.120]   I don't know what this replaces.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.080]   I don't know if it replaces Roku.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.240]   Eventually it could.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.760]   Data replaces Apple TV because that's
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.840]   going to be the only way you can watch iTunes forever.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.520]   Forever.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.840]   There were quite a few of these HDMI stick devices coming out,
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.120]   running Android or running some simple OS, just
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.680]   to provide the same kind of functionality.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.920]   So if anything, this is pretty much Google kind of wiping out
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.400]   that entire market and taking it over themselves,
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.120]   the low cost HDMI stick.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.360]   It is a bit of a bummer that it is in self-power.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.680]   That's the only drawback I've seen compared to some of the other ones.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.560]   But I don't think there was a lot of money
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.640]   going or getting made in that market yet.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.240]   But ultimately none of them have the exposure
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.640]   that this one certainly will.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.200]   So it's an interesting play.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.400]   I don't think Google's going to make a lot of money on this.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.760]   But again, if Google's looking to sell more content,
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.640]   so this is a really great way to do it.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:13.160]   Well, and this is where I find most interesting in the long run
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.520]   in terms of the markets, that's one of the advantages both Google
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.280]   and Amazon have.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.480]   They don't need to make money on their hardware.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.520]   Apple, Asus, other companies need their hardware companies.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.400]   They've got to make money on their products.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:32.160]   But Google and Amazon can sell for cost because they make all their money downstream later.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.040]   And if Google could sell you a device at cost that gives them lots of information
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.080]   about what you watch on TV so they can then put ads in your email or whatever,
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.000]   it's worth it for them.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.600]   Do you think they're taking a loss on this or is it a break even?
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   Or do you think they're making it?
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.640]   Well, you know what I'm immediately I leapt to is what is a Raspberry Pi cost?
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.680]   Just about the same.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.320]   Like a fully configured Raspberry Pi, I would, you know, we'll have to see the teardowns.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.960]   It's a Marvell chip inside.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.040]   It's an ARM 7 Marvell micron flash NAND.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.000]   There's two gigs of flash NAND.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.880]   512 megs of micron RAM.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.480]   Probably the most expensive part would be the radio 802.11bg and Bluetooth
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.680]   as your wave radio.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.520]   Because it makes its own little Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.680]   You connect to it.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.240]   Isn't that cool?
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.240]   That's very cool.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.160]   But that's somewhat like a Raspberry Pi.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   So I'm guessing it's somewhere in that, you know, they might make a few bucks on it.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:36.320]   So I doubt that they're making any money on it, but they don't think they need to.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.960]   Similarly, I don't think Amazon makes money particularly on the Kindle, but they don't
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   need to.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   They even said that.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.480]   They said that the business is not making money on the Kindle.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.040]   The businesses make money every time you use the Kindle.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   Right.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.600]   So that's part one of the Google announcement.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.800]   They also announced Android 4.3 and a new tablet.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.160]   And we're going to talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.280]   Dan Benjamin's here, 5x5.tv, the great network.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.280]   Tim Stevens, former editor in chief at Engadget.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.560]   He's now a blogging at Digital.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.800]   I shouldn't have said that.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   The hat wasn't good.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.960]   He's always a blogger.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:18.960]   He's in his jammies in the basement and he's blogging.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   I am.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   It's good.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   He's what my jammies look like.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   It's surprisingly comfortable.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   That's good.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.960]   Pidstraightjammies.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   Digitaldisplacement.com.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.040]   More to come in just a bit, but first a word from our friends at Citrix.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.400]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400]   Summer is here.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.360]   This is the time when it's so hard to get together, people you work with or potential
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.520]   clients.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:44.480]   And yet, business does not stop just because we're in the middle of the dog days of summer.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   Go to meeting.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.560]   Let's you meet with those people.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.520]   Get the job done.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.120]   Take through the log jams.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.760]   Pitch.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.520]   And it's great because even though you may be on vacation or you're out by the pool or
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.560]   you're at the ballgame, you can use your iPad to present.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.120]   You can listen to the headphones.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.400]   Use the microphone.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.760]   You can see people face to face because they've got now built in HD video conferencing.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.760]   You're sharing screens.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.760]   It really is great.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.800]   Meetings are shorter but more productive, more efficient.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.600]   You can get back to the fun.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.240]   The best part about go to meeting is one flat right for as many meetings as you want as
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.480]   often as you want as long as you want.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.080]   I know teams that actually keep go to meeting running because they're in different locations.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.160]   It's kind of their back channel to one another.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.160]   We're working on using it.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   We're going to do a programming show.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.600]   I think it's a perfect way to do a programming show where you can see the screen.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.680]   You can see the hosts but you can see what they're typing directly.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.680]   It's fabulous.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.280]   I want you to try it free.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.600]   Visit go to meeting.com.

[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.920]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.680]   Promo code is twit.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.520]   We don't do conference calls anymore.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.840]   We do go to meeting.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.320]   Even if we're not going to be on the phone, sharing screen, we're going to be on the
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320]   phone.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.840]   It's just the easiest way to do it.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.840]   Set it up.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.640]   Anything to say about Android 4.3?
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   They're vatted.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.200]   I think aiming at an education market, they've added multi-users which is great.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.080]   I think iPad is not.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.640]   That right there for people I think, especially like me if you have kids and your kids are
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.640]   constantly, you have to dedicate an entire device just to the child.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.480]   Each child has to have that device.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.600]   Otherwise, you completely lose control of that.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.560]   There's kids safety locks.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.920]   They showed in the presentation some game where you could buy more fish.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.760]   Instead of just, and I guess if the game is aware of the safety lock, it would have to
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.760]   be.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   If you're showing the fish that you could buy and saying, "But you can't buy it, kid,"
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.320]   they don't even show it, which is great.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.240]   They don't show other...
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.760]   It's kid-friendly, a school-friendly.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:57.640]   You can have one tablet or two tablets in a class and the individual logins.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.680]   They've also apparently added a trim to the OS, which is big because in the last Nexus
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.920]   7, I noticed this.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.280]   A lot of people reported it got slower and slower.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:16.880]   Turns out it was because the NAND memory starts to, as you use it, become less than optimal.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.240]   Slows down quite a bit.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.000]   Putting trim in cleans it up.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.280]   Apparently when it's asleep and on the charger, it secretly goes in and trims it.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.280]   I noticed almost immediately the old Nexus 7 was back to full speed.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.480]   There's some other features in 4.3.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.480]   It's not a huge...
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.240]   It's still a jelly bean.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.080]   It's not a huge upgrade.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.560]   But it does seem faster in some ways.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.880]   To me, though, the really...
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.120]   To me, at first I ignored it because we'd heard it all.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.320]   When I actually got an Nexus 7, I'm excited about this.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.120]   Okay, here's the deal.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.600]   Apple said...
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.680]   When Apple released the iPad Mini, they didn't say anything, but everybody...
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.320]   I said, "Well, I'm disappointed.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.800]   It's 1024x768 and I don't want it.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.680]   I end up buying it and using it all the time."
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680]   But I was mad.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   So why can't you do a retina?
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.520]   And everybody told me, "Oh, Leo, don't be stupid.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:15.320]   You can't have a retina on a device like this and make it $339 and the battery life
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.320]   would be terrible.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   Don't be dumb."
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.320]   Always a battery life.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.320]   Yeah, battery life, which stuff.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.320]   Don't be dumb.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.920]   Apple couldn't do it.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   And then we're hearing rumors that Apple's not even going to update the iPad Mini till
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.920]   next year because you can't do it.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.080]   So long comes Google with the highest resolution 7-inch display ever, 323.perinch.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.800]   That's retina, baby.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   It's beautiful.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.600]   Battery life has not taken a hit.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.720]   In fact, it might even be arguably a little bit longer.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.320]   It's nine or ten hours than it used to be.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.960]   It's not slow.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.840]   They're using a, I think, a S4 Pro chip in here.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.240]   It's great.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.280]   It's beautiful.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.840]   It's got a 5 megapixel camera just like the iPad Mini.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.560]   I can't -- the only reason at this point I could even tell people by a $110 more expensive
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.920]   Mini is if you're already -- I guess if you're in the Apple ecosystem or this app.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:16.040]   Yeah, but you know, for people who are in that, they just have to wait for Apple.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:23.400]   And I know so many people who they really are invested in a really, really big way in
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.480]   the Apple ecosystem.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   All of their movies are there.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.680]   All of their movies are in the cloud.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.520]   They've already got an investment in apps and this is the space that they live in.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.600]   So it's almost -- it's not yet to the point where you could show them an Android device,
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.880]   no matter how fast it is, no matter how great -- and the screen does look great on this.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880]   It's gorgeous.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.360]   No matter how great the screen looks and show it to them and say, "Oh, this is a selling
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.520]   point for you because look at the screen battery life.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.680]   It's still a nun.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.560]   They're still not going to talk to you about it because they've got that investment."
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.360]   I know lots of people like that.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:01.040]   I know lots of people who are invested in the Android ecosystem as well.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.800]   Would you -- I mean, if somebody isn't invested at all, somebody says, "I want a tablet.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.360]   What should I get?"
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.240]   Seems like it'd be hard not to say -- The screen does look good.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.240]   This looks really good.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   Dan, just touch it.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.200]   I don't know why anybody would start with anything other than this.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   It's good.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.560]   I'm not there for this tablet.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.240]   And I got her the old Nexus 7, unfortunately just a couple of months ago, but that's the
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.680]   way things go.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.120]   But it's a great tablet.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.960]   The right size for a casual tablet user is really easy to carry around.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.120]   It's easy to read on.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.120]   It's comfortable in mind.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.160]   And the battery life is great for sure.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.400]   The only slight reservation I have with this is that they did raise the price a bit up to
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.400]   229.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.120]   But 229 for this.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.120]   I know it's still cheap.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.920]   Crossing over that $200 barrier, I think does take it out of the kind of impulse, obvious
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.120]   buy territory.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   Just a little bit.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.320]   I wish that they hadn't bothered with the camera on the back and dropped the price a
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.440]   bit because of that because I don't think that I'm going to be using it that much.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.720]   I don't know about you guys.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.240]   I use it for this.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.760]   And let me tell you something.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.240]   That is worth the extra $10 right there.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.240]   I can see that.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   That's worth $30.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.440]   That's the auto awesome, by the way, for Google President.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.440]   Sigan?
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.560]   I also wish the Google kept the old Nexus 7 around.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.720]   It's off the site already.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.720]   And I'm guessing that one stock sells out.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.720]   It's gone.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.000]   I wish they'd kept that around at 150 because even at 150.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Make it cheap.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   That's a great tablet.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   Make it cheap.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.760]   iOS 7 is as much as people in the Apple community are talking about it being a really great opportunity
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:36.600]   for iOS developers to come out with a new app and maybe knock out some of the deeply entrenched
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.200]   apps that are there.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.440]   And by saying, well, I have a brand new iOS 7 app that's really amazing, that's better
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.720]   than this other one that hasn't been updated for iOS 7 yet.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.640]   In the same way that that's an opportunity, I think this is also an opportunity for people
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.320]   to maybe consider Android people who are saying, I don't know if I really like iOS 7
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.200]   or if I'm going to switch to something different, maybe I should look at an Android device.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.200]   I don't know.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   I think a lot of people--
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   I think this is going to be huge for them.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.800]   And I always go back to my mom, whose number one thing she's like, she doesn't spend too
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   much money.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.040]   What tablet should I get?
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   And I'll say, well, you know--
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   It's too expensive.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.040]   You know what?
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.040]   It's too expensive.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   It's a Macintosh.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   It's too expensive.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040]   That's right.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   And so--
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.400]   Anna, do I look like I'm made with money, Dan?
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.120]   And she'll-- and if you don't like it, you can go live with your father.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   So she has--
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.120]   That's true.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.120]   --the listeners.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.120]   No.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.440]   That was when I was a kid.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.240]   And-- but that's the thing.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.320]   For her, she'll go to an office depot and she'll look at what they have.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.160]   And she would consider that.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.880]   And I'd say, well, have you looked at the Apple Store, too?
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.600]   And she's like, yeah, but it's $50 more.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.600]   It's $100 more.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:51.960]   And that, for many, many people, is they're comparing two devices that seem very similar.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.760]   Why would they do that if they're not already invested?
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.520]   I would argue at this point.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.560]   I'm against-- by the way, I'm very sympathetic because I get that call a lot on the radio
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.560]   show.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.720]   I want a computer and I don't want to spend more than $300.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.160]   It's like, don't stop.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.440]   Just don't throw your throw and your money away.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.520]   Don't.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.680]   And people just don't understand that-- well, it's a computer.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.680]   I see it.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   It's on the screen.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.920]   It's the same as what is the difference in that?
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.400]   And $800 computer, I don't understand.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.400]   It's going to break.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.560]   It's a piece of crap.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.720]   But you can't explain that to them.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   It's $500.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   Makes a big difference.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.240]   This is-- I would argue a little bit different situation.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.960]   This is actually better than an iPad Mini in every respect.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.480]   And I think, frankly, Apple's going to have a very hard time if they don't update the
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   Mini this year.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.440]   And it looks like they're not going to.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.400]   And it doesn't look like they're going to, although we don't know.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   Nobody really knows.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.120]   The people who I've got so much invested in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.120]   I don't-- you know, I hear that.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.640]   But you can replace all those apps.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.960]   Unless there's apps--
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.280]   Well, content too.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.520]   I mean, all of my movies I get-- I don't say all of my movies.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.320]   That would be different.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   That would be different.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.120]   You know, you're buying movies.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.120]   Music's not a problem.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.320]   You just move it over.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.280]   And they're Spotify for that also.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.080]   And I use Google Music.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.040]   And this is like Spotify.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.680]   I got the $7.99 a month.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.680]   And I'm getting the same--
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.800]   I think it's basically the same selection.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.320]   But yeah, we buy all of it.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.000]   Especially with my kids, that we buy everything through iTunes.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.960]   Every movie.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.400]   Like every--
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.000]   You own them.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.600]   You don't rent them.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.080]   Right.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.560]   I mean, we use Netflix for the crap kid movies.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.640]   And then when a newer one comes out that they want,
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.920]   we get it in iTunes.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.160]   I've kind of moved over to Amazon at this point
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.240]   for that very reason.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.080]   I don't want to be tied too tightly to the--
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.120]   and I have an Apple TV.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.680]   I'm all Mac.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.800]   I have plenty of iPads.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.360]   But I just don't want to be tied into that.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.200]   What do you think, Tim?
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.680]   For A, on the conversation about people don't spend enough.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.520]   They think they really see these low price products.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.640]   And they say, well, that's good enough.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.040]   Yeah, that's definitely a concern.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.800]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.720]   In this case, this--
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.400]   I mean, this is a fantastic device for a fantastic value.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.280]   The '97 last year was a great device for $200.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.880]   And in a lot of ways back then, it
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.080]   was better than the iPad Mini.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.480]   Certainly comparable.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.360]   You can make the case that it was a better choice
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.040]   for a lot of people.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.840]   But now, with the high resolution screen
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.440]   and the better performance, and the other features that
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.520]   are coming in Android 4.3, especially
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.080]   if you've got kids at home, like you mentioned before,
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.480]   is definitely a great buy.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.440]   And I don't see why anybody would really--
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.120]   if you're a casual user again and you don't really
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.320]   need a 10-inch tablet, I don't see why anybody would really
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.600]   think about going with much of anything else at this point,
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.520]   except again, if you've got the content tie.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.880]   And I'm kind of in the same boat.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.560]   But I definitely have shifted more away
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.400]   from purchasing content toward renting content,
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   just because I'm really afraid that anything that I buy
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.640]   at this point isn't going to be playable in even three
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.960]   or four years, regardless of which horse I pick.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.080]   I think going with Amazon is probably the safer bed
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:38.680]   in the long run.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.440]   I agree with you there, Leo.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.120]   But iTunes and Google Play, I don't really
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.160]   know that--
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.880]   I don't know where those guys are going to be in three years.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.600]   I know where my Blu-ray collection is going to be in three
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.160]   years, but I don't know necessarily where my iTunes demos
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:50.440]   will be.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.720]   That's a good question, because I was going to buy the complete
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.440]   Sopranos.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.560]   And I thought, well, I looked at the Blu-ray.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.840]   It's about $200 for the complete DVD, not for Blu-ray,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.600]   but the complete DVD.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.920]   Maybe it's $200 for the Blu-ray, too.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.040]   And I looked on Amazon streaming $200 for all six seasons.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.960]   Now, on the one hand, the convenience of having this--
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.360]   I'm not having a physical media is great.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.920]   I don't want to buy any more Blu-ray discs.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.960]   But you're right.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.640]   I mean, what are the rights that I have to this?
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.800]   They're going to go away at some point.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.000]   If I die, I can't hand my Amazon account over to my heirs.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.880]   And there is, of course, ultraviolet, which hopefully will
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.000]   make things a little bit easier in that regard.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.280]   But again, it's really tied to traditional media
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   and the traditional means of buying things.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.600]   I just got the Bond 50th anniversary collection.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.320]   Me, too.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.400]   I got that on DVD.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.080]   Which is fantastic.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.160]   But again, it's something that I could see myself wanting
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.360]   to watch in a couple of years.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.040]   And whether or not I'm going to want to have a Blu-ray player
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.840]   hooked up in a couple of years, who knows?
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.800]   But certainly, I do, right now, still feel a little bit safer
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.760]   in physical media, which is a little bit weird for me to say.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.600]   I even feel a bit uncomfortable saying that, to be honest.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.440]   I know.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.760]   I don't want to buy into physical media anymore.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   But if you don't have a book, if you don't have a disc,
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.280]   if you don't have a cassette or eight track, what do you have?
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.000]   Yeah, I remember a couple of years ago,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.920]   I was talking to Jason Snell and Andy Naco about comics
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.640]   and digital comics.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.280]   Perfect example.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.680]   Both of these guys, they're old school comic book collectors.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.880]   Like, I used to be.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.720]   And they were telling me, oh, man, we're both all digital.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.600]   Everything that we do in the comic space is all digital.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.800]   And I was like, you guys are crazy.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.840]   Don't bag and board anymore.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.760]   And they're like, no, what are you doing?
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.840]   It's ancient history.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.160]   You have to go back and board, right there.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.320]   That tells you everything you need to know.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   Everything you need to know.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.760]   And but you know what?
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.320]   Like, I made that transition myself away from doing that.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.680]   But I love the fact that I can be in a hotel room
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.080]   and I can say, OK, what movie am I going to watch
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.400]   when I go back to on the flight back?
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.000]   And I can just rent it or download it.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.440]   You can do that with any device.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:51.240]   But the idea of like, oh, I have a physical DVD.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.920]   I need to hand break it now.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.160]   And I need to get it over here.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.320]   And I need to remember to sync.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.800]   And now that's an hour of my time,
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.440]   additional on the trip that I need to set aside
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.360]   just to be able to watch a movie or I can download it.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.680]   Like, I'm going to download it.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.120]   And that's where Netflix and Amazon instant
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.520]   are just out of the question is that I'm on a plane scenario.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.480]   So you've got to ran or buy in that.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.280]   But we've got options now.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.240]   I just still-- I mean, I really wish--
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.400]   and everybody wishes this-- that there was--
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.520]   there wasn't this marriage between the device and the content.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:28.240]   And that's the scary part, regardless of which device
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.640]   they're using, especially in the case of Amazon.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.440]   Maybe we have to rethink our relationship to content.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.240]   I mean, we certainly are tied in from years of experience
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.200]   to the notion that if you buy a book, you've got it.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.120]   It's on your bookshelf.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.280]   You're going to hand it down.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.120]   But maybe that isn't really the way content needs
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.200]   to live in the future.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.720]   Maybe it's more ephemeral than that.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.240]   Maybe that's an old fashioned way of thinking of content.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.720]   Like if the content somehow becomes cheap enough
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.880]   that instead of paying 10 or 20 or 30 bucks for a book or a DVD,
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.560]   if it's a box--
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.240]   rent it when you need it, rent it when you need it,
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.320]   and then it goes away.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.360]   And if you don't have to hand it down to your kid,
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.040]   your kid spends a buck when they want to watch.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.400]   Do we really gain anything by having boxes full of crap
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.360]   that our kids are going to have to throw out anyway?
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.160]   Yeah, like I have.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:12.520]   You know--
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.880]   Now I'm an older guy than you.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.080]   I'm faced with this, you see?
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.560]   It's not good to have a lot of stuff in your life.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.560]   Aren't we-- isn't bits doing us a favor?
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.120]   I wish we could buy content directly from publishers.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.680]   And then it would basically be up to them
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.440]   to find ways for us to get that content on our new devices
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.040]   down the road.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.680]   But we always had to buy it from publishers
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.440]   through some other means, whether it be iTunes or watch it
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.400]   through Netflix or something like that.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.600]   If I could just go directly to the music label
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.840]   or directly to the movie house or directly to whoever
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.080]   actually owns the content itself and buy a license directly
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.280]   from them, and then effectively trust
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.800]   that they would then manage that license
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.000]   and allow me to get that content down the road.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.520]   That to me would be a much better solution.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:56.000]   Or ideally, I would just go and pay so many $20 a month
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.960]   to have unlimited access to every movie and everything
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.800]   that they've ever made.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.000]   And then just keep paying them $20 until the end of time.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.120]   That would be pretty nice to me.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.440]   I'm honestly ready to move away from ownership altogether,
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.920]   because ultimately, the concept that you own something
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.200]   on a CD is obviously wrong.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.960]   You didn't actually own anything except for the plastic disc.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.400]   Now we've gotten rid of the plastic disc,
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.120]   and it's getting harder to get that content as you go
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.680]   from device to device.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.360]   If we could just get away from ownership altogether
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.520]   and have much better plans for leasing or renting this stuff,
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.280]   that for me would be a bunch better solution.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.400]   - I'm probably the wrong person to ask,
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.280]   'cause I rarely reread a book, re-watch a movie,
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.240]   re-watch a TV show.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.040]   When I wanna watch Godfather, I don't mind running it again.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.880]   There's very few movies that are good enough,
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.680]   but I know there are a lot of OCD people like Andy and Oco
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.840]   and Dan Benjamin who--
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.040]   - I re-watch movies.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.880]   (laughing)
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.800]   - I just knew that you were a movie re-watch.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.680]   - I do, I do re-watch them.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.920]   There's certain ones I re-watch.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.760]   - Over and over.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.400]   - So you wanna own the sound music?
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.240]   - You wanna own those and--
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.240]   - It's just--
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.080]   - The sound of music.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:57.920]   - That's good.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.760]   - Yes, the sound of music.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.680]   And my kids, they have movies where you've had young kids
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.400]   before, where they watch the same movie--
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.480]   - Multiple times a week.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.320]   - Kids for sure.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.160]   - Kids for sure.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.640]   So what I did is this was back in the VHS era,
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.840]   'cause I'm, again, that old, I took Bambi.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.880]   I edited out the scene where there's no spoilers here,
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.120]   but there's some bad stuff happens to Bambi's--
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.560]   - You edited that out.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.280]   - I literally edited that out,
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.680]   and then put it back on a VHS cassette,
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.960]   'cause I didn't want my kids to be traumatized.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.760]   It made the movie a little strange,
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.880]   like, where'd Bambi's mother go?
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.000]   She's like, what happened?
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.680]   But they were young, they didn't know any better.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.880]   I never understood why Walt put that in that movie.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.240]   That was a horrible moment,
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.800]   and I still cry sometimes at night when I think about it.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.760]   - Did they ever figure that out?
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.600]   Did they figure out how it's actually supposed to end?
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.440]   - No.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.760]   - They built it in the same--
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.080]   - It doesn't end, the movie goes on
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.720]   after Bambi's mom goes away.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.520]   The movie continues, but I just cut that part out.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.000]   And you know what, they never knew better.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.080]   - They still don't know today what happened.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.240]   - Still don't know today, and if they're watching,
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.320]   I'm sorry, kids.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.000]   But I could do that 'cause we owned physical media.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.280]   - Yeah.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   - I probably could not do that if it were on iTunes.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.040]   I might, I could rip it.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.400]   - I don't know. - I could skip the scene.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.840]   - Just fast forward. - Mm-hmm.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.680]   - Yeah.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:19.720]   How do you stand on the Bambi?
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   Nevermind, I wish.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.560]   - That's it.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.400]   - That's it.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.640]   - See, on Andy and Akozomenac, he could talk about that.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.840]   - Yes, that could be a whole show.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.960]   - That's a whole show right there.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.800]   - That's a whole show.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.640]   - Bambi's mom.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.480]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.160]   - We did a show just on the opening credits
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.520]   of the Temple of Doom ones.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.360]   (laughing)
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.200]   - I love it.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   (laughing)
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.320]   - It was a good show, isn't it?
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.000]   Andy actually said, he said, "Look, I'm gonna give you
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.200]   "first rights of refusal.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.320]   "I wanna do a show about nothing."
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.800]   I said, "Go ahead, call Dan, that's fine."
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.640]   - Uh-huh.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.160]   - Is that how you pitch this here?
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.000]   - That's excellent.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.800]   - I said, "Dan, it'd be great for that show."
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   You go right ahead, Dan, you have another show
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.000]   that you don't wanna do, let me know.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.800]   - The Enoch goes all-manack.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.720]   - I'm here for you.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.560]   100%.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.720]   (laughing)
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.560]   - It's a good show.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   - It is a good show.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.400]   - It is a good show.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.480]   - But again, I think not for me because we've tried,
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.760]   you know, we've tried a lifestyle geek culture shows.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.520]   They don't do that well on our network.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.440]   It's great that he does that on your network
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.920]   'cause I love listening to him.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.200]   Highly recommend it, by the way,
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.600]   5by5.tv, it's called--
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.440]   - Thank you.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.120]   - It's all-manack among 35 other shows.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:27.280]   I love the Syracuse a show.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.120]   - Yeah.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.960]   - He's such an ass.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.200]   I mean, not as in a bad way.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.240]   He's just bitter.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.320]   He's a bitter man.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.360]   - That was a good show.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.760]   - It's a great, he doesn't do that anymore?
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.480]   - No, he retired and he retired, he did his run.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.320]   - You know, he did his thing.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.160]   He did it.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.760]   - He still is on some other shows around the internet,
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.000]   but he complained about everything he had to complain.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.280]   - He got it out of his system.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.600]   - Got it out of his system, is it?
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.320]   (laughing)
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.160]   - I love that show.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.160]   - He cleared out the pipe, so he was--
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.400]   - He was just bitter, bitter man.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   - Oh yeah.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.240]   (laughing)
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   - He could easily talk about one--
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.080]   - And another thing.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.240]   - Little thing for a long time.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.080]   - And another thing.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.120]   - Yeah.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.440]   - What's your favorite right now that you're doing?
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.440]   - Well, I mean, I--
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.680]   - You're all of them are your baby.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.120]   - All of them are my favorite shows,
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:06.960]   everyone's gonna be--
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.560]   - I'm jealous that you have Merlin Mann.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.400]   - Back to work.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   - Back to work is your very show.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.720]   - The ladies love Merlin Mann.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.040]   - I love Merlin Mann.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.400]   - I would be a lady if he wanted me to,
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.320]   whatever he wants.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.160]   - Yeah.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.000]   - Wow.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.080]   - But no, he doesn't like me anymore.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.400]   - I know, I don't think that's true.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.320]   - Something happened.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.160]   - He's never said anything--
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.480]   - We had a breach.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.520]   (laughing)
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.520]   Like a breach birth.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.440]   - We had a breach.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.080]   I shouldn't have kissed him that.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.240]   It wasn't the kiss, it might have been the tongue.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.200]   But anyway, it's whatever it's over.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.520]   - That's a wonderful show to do.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.160]   (laughing)
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.240]   - That's a good job.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.400]   (laughing)
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.520]   Our show today brought to you,
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.000]   and they're wondering why by Squarespace,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.120]   (laughing)
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.920]   they're saying let's buy more time on five by five.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   - You'd have Squarespace.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920]   - Yes, right company.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.760]   - So we'd come from Squarespace.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.600]   - They are amazing.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.440]   - Do you love them?
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.280]   - I do love them.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.000]   And the way you need to, am I doing this?
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.840]   - I'll do this.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.680]   - We'll do it together if you want.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.520]   - We'll tag team this.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.360]   - Tag team.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.160]   - It is the all in one place to go to make a website,
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.680]   and you can do anything in the world with their website.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.160]   So it doesn't even matter what you wanna do.

[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.040]   You can do that.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:10.880]   - Perfect.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.360]   - Tim could open his blog up on Squarespace.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.640]   - Portfolio, if you wanna do portfolio of old Toyotas,
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.160]   just like great definitely.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.000]   - The momentum, full bleed,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.280]   template be perfect for that, Tim,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.000]   just big pictures of gearboxes.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.920]   No, I'm sure it's a beautiful view.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.880]   - You can do image galleries,
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.840]   and what's really cool when you go to squarespace.com,
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.920]   you can see all of, you can see these great examples.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.760]   They have these great videos that they've done,
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.800]   showing you how people, whether they're illustrators,
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.960]   or the photographers, whether they're bloggers,
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.440]   or you know, they even have examples
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.360]   that show you how like a restaurant could use it.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.640]   They have examples of how you can do it with a business.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.080]   And the thing that you need to know
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.520]   about Squarespace is that it's,
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.960]   you don't need to know CSS,
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.400]   you don't need to know HTML,
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.280]   all of their templates are responsive,
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.040]   all you need to-- - But you're a web developer.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.200]   - In a past-- - Have you played
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.600]   with the developers platform?
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.440]   - I have. - 'Cause that's pretty sweet.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.520]   - And you can, and that's an important thing to know.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.360]   But you, if you do-- - You don't have to know it,
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.360]   but you do. - Exactly.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.180]   - This guy's the limit.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.480]   - Yeah, if you know what you're doing,
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.360]   and you wanna get under the hood, you totally can.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.000]   And if you're just like a regular person
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.080]   who's doing something else,
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.640]   but knows you wanna do a website, you can drag and drop,
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.760]   you can customize every single setting,
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.160]   just with little sliders, it's amazing.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.840]   - Have you, now, so let me ask you this,
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.000]   'cause you're a Squarespace expert.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.840]   - Responsive.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.960]   - We have never been able to bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.120]   And we've done it, we've sent the Twitter army off.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:23.960]   - We bring off.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.280]   - We bring sites down routinely.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.840]   Squarespace, I think it's because the CMS,
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.240]   the software, is very tightly integrated
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.640]   to the server software.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.160]   It's all running on a Java platform, I believe.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.280]   And they just, they can turn on more bandwidth
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.600]   faster than you can blink on the site.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.520]   - Yeah, you never bring down a site.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.360]   There's no way you're gonna bring it.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.200]   - Try.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.760]   - You know what, inside.twit.tv, our blog.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.200]   Try to go ahead, just everybody,
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.120]   if everybody goes there right now,
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.200]   and let's see if we can just bring it down.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.720]   Inside, I'm gonna go there, you go there,
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.440]   everybody watching at home go there.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.280]   - It's still up.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.840]   - Inside.twit.tv.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.000]   Let's see if we can bring it down.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.280]   We can't, I know we can't, we've done this before.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.800]   So here's the deal, if you wanna try it,
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.120]   you can, the other thing I really like about Squarespace,
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.800]   I love it when our sponsors say, just try it.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.640]   No credit card needed, that shows confidence, right?
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.480]   - Yeah.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.600]   - We don't, all you gotta do is name your site,
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.520]   give us an email, in case you forget your password,
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.200]   make up a password, you got two weeks,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.920]   run to the place, you can do anything you want,
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.720]   even import your existing content.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.680]   They have blog importers from all the major APIs.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.160]   - Oh yeah, that's very cool.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.520]   - Even comments and images, all the SEO
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.840]   and links will preserve the whole thing.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.200]   Play with it for two weeks.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.520]   In fact, they even told me, they said,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.760]   you know what, if you've got like a wedding coming up
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.440]   in two weeks and you wanna blog just for people
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.000]   going to the wedding, but you don't wanna pay for it,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.760]   just do it for two weeks and then that's it.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.320]   And you don't have to ever pay us.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.880]   But if you decide you wanna keep it around longer
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.920]   than two weeks, we've got some very good deals for you.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.160]   Visit squarespace.com and take a look
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.680]   at the different plans so you know what you're going for.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.400]   If you wanna do e-commerce, it's 24 bucks a month.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.880]   They don't take a cut by the way.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.800]   It's not like, you know, you have unlimited digital
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.200]   or physical assets, you can, yeah, sell a book
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.880]   and an ebook, a CD or an MP3.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.720]   They will do things like inventory tracking for you.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.920]   They calculate the tax, the shipping.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.360]   You can have arbitrary number of coupons.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.240]   You know, if you're on Twitch, you say,
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.640]   I wanna give a Twitch listeners a coupon, easy to do.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.560]   You just couple of clicks.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.560]   24 bucks a month and that includes unlimited bandwidth,
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.000]   storage, pages, galleries and blogs.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.080]   16 bucks a month if you don't want the e-commerce,
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.680]   that's for the yearly plan.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.800]   By the way, when you get a yearly plan,
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.120]   they also hook up the custom domain name for free.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:30.960]   I'm just a big fan.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.800]   Give it a try.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.920]   We will give you a little break.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.720]   You can use our offer code, Twitch7.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.880]   We wanna check out some of the sites
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.760]   you've built with Squarespace.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.840]   So send us a tweet with your Squarespace website,
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.880]   #tagit, Twitch Squarespace.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.520]   Twitch Squarespace.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.360]   - Okay.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.280]   - And a little later on the show,
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.080]   we'll just look at some of those.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   That's a good idea.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:59.240]   So tweet, you don't have to tweet @leoloport
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.080]   or anything like that.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.080]   Just use the hashtag #twitssquarespace
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:02.920]   and I'll do a search.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.800]   - Can you talk about the integrations that they have?
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.640]   - Like what?
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.000]   - If you're a developer and you're--
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.840]   - For Twitter or--
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.680]   - Yeah, for Twitter.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.400]   But they've got the big ones for all the social networks,
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.080]   but if you're a developer and you have a GitHub account
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.160]   that you can integrate that,
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.160]   if you're a Dropbox user--
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.160]   - A Dropbox user.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.000]   - Yeah.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.200]   - Wow. - And if you're a Dropbox user
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.600]   and you have like galleries set up
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.720]   when you upload an image to Dropbox image gallery,
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.160]   it can show up as an image gallery on Squarespace,
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.000]   all that stuff.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.840]   It's good stuff.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.680]   It's good stuff.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.520]   Twitch Squarespace, #twitssquarespace.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:36.200]   And the tweets just pour in.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.440]   - Moving on.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.640]   You can't watch porn in Britain soon, just a heads up.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   - Oh, it's--
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.120]   - It'll be blocked by default.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.200]   - That is so weird. - So you can opt in
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.520]   and my joke is that opting in immediately emails your wife
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.360]   and let you--
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.200]   - Yeah.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.040]   - Let's turn now.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:55.880]   - Excuse me, Mr. Prime Minister,
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.800]   I would like to watch porn.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.680]   Could you just flip that switch for me?
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.040]   - Mr. Cameron, sir.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.360]   What do you have to go walk in the town square
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.920]   and say I am a porn watcher to get the porn turned on?
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.240]   Just unbelievable.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.080]   People just--
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.920]   - How do they block it for the whole country all at one time?
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.400]   - Well, they're going through the ISPs.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.760]   So the way it works, and by the way, one of the ISPs
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:25.640]   uses a filter system made by Huawei.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.000]   She's owned by the Chinese military.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.680]   So I think that's a nice nexus.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.520]   - Yeah.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.360]   - Go together.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.440]   - Yeah.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.280]   - The Chinese military is determining what's porn in the UK.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:39.360]   By the way, the ISPs are not thrilled about this,
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.200]   of course, the British ISPs, but they've always had this.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.640]   Apparently, this has always been the case
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.400]   that there is a switch.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.160]   You could turn on that this was by law,
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.400]   or at least by agreement with the ISPs.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.560]   There is a filter and people could turn it on.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.720]   What's changing is it's gonna be on by default now.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:56.000]   So you have to explicitly say no, no.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.760]   No porn, we're British or something like that.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:05.840]   And of course, it's gonna block stuff that is not porn.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:10.000]   Furthermore, David Cameron, the Prime Minister himself said,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.320]   "Oh, but that doesn't include page three,
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.560]   "the topless girls in the newspaper."
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.560]   In the newspaper, "Oh, no, no, we're not gonna block that.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.840]   "So I don't know."
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.440]   This is the problem, it's a slippery slope.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.280]   What is porn?
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.120]   I don't know.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.200]   Leo's porn, okay, block him.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.160]   He's advocating porn, which I am,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.760]   'cause it's a fun thing to watch.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.160]   No, I'm not, I don't care.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.960]   I'm going down the rabbit hole,
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.840]   and I can't stop myself falling.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.960]   We're number nine, the US is now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.840]   something to be proud of, number nine
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.240]   in internet connection, ranking.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:49.080]   So maybe if you're curious for this,
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.120]   would you like to move to a country with a better ranking
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.320]   than the internet?
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.200]   As soon as this site comes up, I'll give you the list.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   There it is.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:02.120]   Mine is just, apparently my internet is down.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.680]   They blocked it.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.640]   Why, yours came right up.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.080]   I'm on the production Wi-Fi now.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.200]   Me too.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.680]   You know what, this is the new MacBook here.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.560]   I think I'm still having the Wi-Fi problems.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.400]   This one is new too, and it's--
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.560]   Oh, that's the 2013?
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.880]   Yeah, this is the brand new 11, 11 inch one.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.560]   And you have it, did you have any Wi-Fi problems with that?
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.040]   Yeah, and then it went away the other day.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:20.880]   When they updated it.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.000]   OK, here it is, finally.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.720]   This is from Akamai, which probably--
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.560]   They would not--
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.560]   They would not be fairly reasonable.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.880]   They do-- they're the biggest CDN in the world,
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.240]   and they serve a lot of content.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.320]   They do a state of the internet report.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.120]   They handle about a third of the global web traffic.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.120]   This is for the first quarter, Q1, 2013.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:46.080]   We dropped from our previous place,
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.640]   I guess we were eighth, at 8.6 megabits per second.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.080]   Sweden now is beating us.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:55.040]   I think we need to work on this, 8.9 megabits.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:55.560]   Lot of--
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.760]   So inside info here on why we're going to go on up soon.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.880]   We are-- OK, let me give you the list.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.800]   Places that have better internet than we do.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:08.680]   South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Switzerland,
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:16.000]   the Netherlands, Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Sweden.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.680]   Thank god--
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.760]   At least we're at a Danish.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.760]   --are slower than us.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.560]   Seriously.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.040]   Because I'm--
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.600]   I think we'll be faster soon, because I just finally
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.920]   got cable after living in this house for a year.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.360]   I'm no longer on a wireless connection.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.160]   I now have 50 megabytes.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:27.680]   I know.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:31.320]   So I'm going to be pushing our average up, I think.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.480]   And you're all welcome.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.000]   Now that you're not working for any gadget,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.920]   your phone never drops off.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.560]   This is true.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.080]   Yes.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.760]   You actually have fiber to my home now, thankfully.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   So it was quite a big step up.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.200]   Good.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.600]   Actually, Verizon is now offering half a gigabit Fios.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.240]   It's like 300 bucks a month.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.360]   It's kind of expensive.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.400]   I say I would have to get that.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.200]   We've got Google Fiber coming off.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:51.840]   I know.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.240]   Excited, but yeah.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.240]   I'm excited about that.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.360]   It's good stuff.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.400]   So I saw that.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.520]   And I actually contemplated a move to your house.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.360]   Come on out.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:01.880]   Got the box.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.520]   Got a room in that.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.800]   Boston will be the third city right after Kansas City
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.160]   was the first.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.920]   Kansas City was the first Salt Lake City getting it.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.760]   Somewhere in Utah Provo.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.720]   I thought we were the second.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.600]   Are you-- Austin, then Provo?
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.120]   She's good.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:13.440]   I like it.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.800]   Yeah, so you jumped right on her eye.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.960]   And I'll let me look that up for you, sir.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.040]   That's just an excuse to be on her phone.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   She's actually tweeting.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.440]   Why is it that we are-- because we
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.080]   are the original internet country.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.160]   And so this happened with cell phones, right?
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:30.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:32.520]   We were at a disadvantage because cell phone service
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.120]   started here.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.560]   And so we had older networks.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.360]   And countries like South Korea let
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.040]   leapfrogged over us just by saying, well, no,
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.600]   we're going to put in the new stuff.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:39.920]   The fast--
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.120]   Now we got regulation and selling things down.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.640]   I was in Romania last year.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.440]   And they were just building out their cell phone networks.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.680]   So they had really fast HSPA and really fast
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   connectivity pretty much throughout the entire country,
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.640]   which is amazing, much faster than we have through much
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.000]   of our--
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.200]   through much of the mill states anyway.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.120]   So that was a little bit disappointing to see on.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.080]   So you know, I think that's exactly what's going on here
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.560]   to newer networks or faster than our aging ones.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.880]   Number one state for average internet speed in the country.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.640]   What would you guess?
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.720]   The biggest, the best, the fastest state Texas, perhaps?
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:09.560]   I don't think--
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.160]   Out of Texas, yeah.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.000]   Maybe New York.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.640]   No, Vermont.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.880]   Yes, I'm a Vermontian, so I'm very proud of that.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.000]   Vermont didn't have AT&T until last year.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.240]   Really?
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.520]   But you've got the fastest internet.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.280]   I don't understand it.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:32.120]   Then New Hampshire, then Delaware.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.040]   It's all East Coast.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.360]   District of Columbia, where are you from, man?
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.480]   East Coast, Michigan, not on the list.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.240]   Utah, Massachusetts, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey,
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.520]   and Connecticut, to round out the top 10.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.520]   All of them.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.400]   It also has the best maple syrup in the country too.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:48.760]   It did.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.200]   No.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.280]   Well in the country, OK.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:53.560]   It's the--
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.360]   It's the sweetest.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.280]   It's the sweetest.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.520]   Vermont?
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.560]   Yeah, there's actually a loss dating the minimum sugar
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.720]   content in Vermont.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.040]   It's actually higher than that from Quebec and from elsewhere.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.120]   Oh, OK.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.040]   I'm going to stop buying that damn Canadian stuff
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.160]   and start buying Vermont maple syrup.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.080]   I always did get Vermont maple syrup, actually,
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.000]   because we lived in Rhode Island.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.560]   That's the thing you learned today about the thing.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.520]   We had a maple tree out front.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.320]   We tapped it once.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.440]   It didn't make good maple syrup though.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.240]   There's, I guess, there's a sugar maple.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.480]   It's a particular kind of maple.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.720]   Yeah, you know about this timmer.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.080]   I'm just looking at you for no reason.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.440]   I know all about it.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.600]   You get syrup from all sorts of maples.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.760]   And even you can make it from pine trees too.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.640]   But maples have the highest sugar content within their sap.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.640]   So you need the least sap that I should do.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.000]   I think it's 30 gallons from a sugar maple.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.160]   And from other maples, it's closer to 50 or 60 gallons
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.400]   per gallon of maple syrup.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.400]   It's just a little bit of a syrup that you get out.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.120]   So you have to, it's like a 30 to one ratio of water.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.240]   You boil it, that's your boil it.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.080]   Is that what you do?
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:48.920]   You boil it down?
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.240]   Yeah, you boil it for days and days and days and days.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.240]   Have you done this?
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.080]   And steam rising.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.240]   I have done this, yes.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.080]   I'm a Vermonter.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   Everyone's done this.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.080]   It's pretty much part of your education.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.680]   So do you like go out in the backyard and go, I tap that tree.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.040]   I have an engagement.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.040]   You've got to look for the red--
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.040]   I like this.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.040]   --but the red leaves in the back.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.040]   Yeah, I like this.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.040]   This is good.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.040]   This conversation is going all sorts of me.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.320]   How many gallons do you get out of a tree?
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   I obviously depends on the size of the tree.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.400]   Not a whole lot, honestly.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.120]   I mean, these big, big farms that make a lot of syrup
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.440]   have hundreds and hundreds of acres of trees.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.720]   You know, one tree you can make to get a couple of gallons
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.240]   of maple syrup out of at the end of the season.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:32.320]   If you're constantly tapping it and clearing those buckets,
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.200]   it's a lot of work.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.760]   It's a lot of-- I haven't done it since I was a kid,
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.560]   just because it takes a lot of work.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.480]   Takes a mighty big tree to make gallons of maple syrup.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.280]   That it does.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.920]   Mm-mm.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.520]   Google serves 25-- as long as we're talking numbers--
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.600]   Google serves 25% of North American internet traffic.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   When you combine that to what the 30% of Netflix--
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.760]   between Google and Netflix, it's like half of the internet.
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.160]   In the US is Google or Netflix.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.920]   Yeah, that's crazy numbers.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.560]   And it's--
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.280]   That must be YouTube when they say Google, right?
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.040]   I think that-- well, I think that includes, yeah,
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.360]   that would include YouTube and all of their properties.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.440]   But what they're saying here in this great article
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.440]   is that it explains why Google is building so many data
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.840]   centers and why you keep seeing these things going up.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:22.640]   Three years ago, it says they were 6% of the internet traffic.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.960]   And that's insane how--
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:25.520]   What?
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.280]   Three years.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.760]   They quadrupled in three years?
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.040]   That crazy.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.920]   That-- I'm saying it must be YouTube, because YouTube
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.720]   has seen that kind of growth, right?
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.200]   I mean, I don't think search engine traffic is a huge--
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:36.840]   well, maybe it is.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.400]   I don't know.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:43.880]   Google's been building data centers on four continents.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:47.680]   And pretty soon, every 10 will have a Google data center.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.440]   That's exactly what they want.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.200]   Actually, Google has more data centers in the NSA, really.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:53.920]   If you think about it.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.240]   As long as each data center comes with a fiber connection
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.160]   to my house, I'm OK with that.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.160]   Wow.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.200]   Yeah, and I think you're right about the YouTube.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.680]   But I think they also do--
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.600]   when you think about their web apps,
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.000]   when you think about Gmail and things like that,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.720]   and people who are-- I wonder if they count that.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:13.160]   Like, if you're a Gmail user, if they're including that--
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.360]   Right.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.520]   Because if they are, you think about that,
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.160]   think about all the email, the attachments.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.240]   That's-- those are big numbers, too.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.360]   And it's Google Drive, too, which--
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.200]   That's a good point, actually.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.120]   It's all at this point.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.240]   But it's only going to get bigger.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.640]   Right.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.720]   Right.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.040]   I don't-- Google doesn't-- for some reason, it doesn't scare me.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.000]   But maybe you guys have smart or smarter.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.560]   Does Google-- does that worry you the size that Google is
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.240]   becoming?
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.640]   People often used to say, oh, it's Skynet.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.140]   Right.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:38.720]   It's getting close.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.960]   And they start building robots.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.000]   And they are.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.560]   Especially those with laser eyes and guns,
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.280]   and that can fly and step on skulls and things.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.880]   Then I'll get a little bit worried.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.000]   But no, I mean, ultimately, someone's
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.600]   going to have all your information.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.000]   I'm almost happier that it's with one person,
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.720]   rather than scatter shot across the zillion different startups
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.920]   with varying levels of security.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.520]   I tend to trust Google more than startup X.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.640]   And so if Google continues to innovate and do interesting
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.240]   things, I'm reasonably comfortable having them
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:07.880]   have my data.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.080]   It is a little bit worrying that they can connect a lot more
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.040]   dots than anybody else on the internet at this point.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.080]   But as long as they stay secure and so far, you know,
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:18.440]   knock on wood here so far so far so far so far so far
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.920]   so far so good on that point.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.720]   I still think that Google's goal is just
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:25.640]   to get as much information about us as possible.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.800]   And that--
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:27.440]   Then what?
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.040]   I don't know.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.200]   That's the big question is then what.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.440]   But I feel like all of the things that Google is doing right
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.120]   now is to get information.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:38.600]   And I'm not in the conspiracy theory group saying
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.760]   Google's trying to build, you know,
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.080]   like a personality record on every single person
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.320]   as much as they're trying to understand what people do
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.280]   in general.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.920]   Not so much what did Leo look at today,
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.000]   but what do people likely or what do people in general
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:55.800]   want to do?
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.960]   What are they all trying to do?
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.200]   That wouldn't scare you, would it?
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:58.800]   It doesn't scare me.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.480]   This is general.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.480]   It's not-- I mean, it's not--
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.280]   Well, that's if we go the route of saying
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.600]   Google is not necessarily evil and that they're just--
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.400]   because if they understand these kinds of trends,
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:13.240]   it's like the Twitter thing where they can show you
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.640]   Twitter advertisements now or will be showing you
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.000]   Twitter advertisements based on the ad
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.560]   that you just saw on TV, where it's that kind of connected.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.280]   I think Google wants to see these trends.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.480]   They want to see what people are doing
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.720]   and what consumers are buying.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.840]   And I think there's the individual targeting for sure
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.800]   in there, but I think the real value for Google
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.200]   is to just understand us as a people
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.120]   and what we're doing and where we're going
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.920]   and what we want to focus on.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.520]   And if they can understand that, then they can get ahead of it.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.080]   And then what are they going to do?
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:41.600]   I don't know.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.960]   But everything that they do is to learn our habits
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.480]   and to mine that data.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.160]   That's what I think.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   So why don't necessarily think they're doing it for evil?
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:51.500]   So--
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.640]   Yeah, it doesn't bother me.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.840]   I don't know why, but it doesn't bother me.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.280]   But then I start saying, oh, but look, now I have the Google
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.960]   phone, and I have the Google tablet,
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.160]   and I have the Google on my TV.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.000]   And I like it.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.360]   Now I'm wondering if I've been co-opted, you know?
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.840]   I love Google now.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.640]   It doesn't scare me.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.600]   It's great.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.360]   I get to the airport.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.960]   It shows me my ticket.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.920]   Yeah, but I think there's a whole group of people.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.680]   I understand.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.160]   It's kind of large who are-- they're very worried.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.400]   So they shouldn't use Google.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.280]   They should let me use Google and not use it themselves.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.960]   They have that choice for the most part.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.360]   But I think they're trying to stop me from using Google.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.960]   They're like saying, oh, Google shouldn't exist.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.920]   No, if you don't want to use it, go home.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.920]   Don't go outside because there's satellites.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.840]   Right, but see, this is what people are afraid of is that
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.600]   everything eventually is going to go through Google.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   Google Fiber comes to Austin, right?
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.160]   And now I get Google Fiber.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.720]   Now they've got everything.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.680]   That's why they're doing it.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.760]   This is what the people say.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:51.840]   I'm not the people.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.920]   This is not-- I'm not saying this.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.880]   No, no, I understand.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.880]   I know why I understand that.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.400]   Thank you for--
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.640]   Thank you for channeling the people.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.360]   I do that.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.200]   You're a man of the people.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.680]   Man of the people.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.920]   The upstream and downstream now, everything that I do
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.600]   is going through Google, right?
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.000]   And I'm using Gmail.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.520]   And I'm using Google Apps for work, right?
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.920]   And I have the Google Play on the Android.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.520]   And I'm running movies from--
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.960]   and even the stuff that I'm doing that
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.200]   falls outside of Google, like Amazon or Netflix or Apple,
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.040]   now they see what I'm doing there, too.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.160]   That makes people nervous.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:22.600]   I don't want to go all gocker on you.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.520]   But there have been a number of articles about Eric Schmidt
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.320]   building a condo in New York City that
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.360]   is heavily soundproofed, and he won't have a doorman.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.080]   He can pay for privacy is worth $8 billion.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:38.000]   And it's kind of funny that the guy who says, hey, don't worry.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.120]   Let us spy on you.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.360]   If you haven't done anything wrong,
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.840]   you're not going to have enough in the fear.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.120]   He literally said that, which I'm sure he wishes he hadn't,
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.360]   is so concerned about his own privacy,
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.600]   he's soundproofing his apartment.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.920]   Maybe it's his neighbors.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.840]   I think there's one guy who has like the big base.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.520]   You don't want that goes to him.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.840]   Goes to the worst.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.880]   But no doorman.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.680]   And of course, the gocker part of this
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.280]   so he can sneak girlfriends in or whatever.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.600]   But I don't, regardless of that, he wants privacy.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.040]   And he can afford privacy.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.640]   He doesn't fly commercial.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.920]   No.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.040]   He doesn't have to worry about this.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.360]   Everything we do is tracked anyway.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.200]   Like there isn't anything that you can do today
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.480]   that isn't a record in a database.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.680]   Your ISP knows more about you than anybody, right?
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.960]   And I don't trust my ISP.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.320]   My ISP is conference.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:21.880]   Never.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.840]   Who's your ISP?
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.800]   A time Warner Cable.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.400]   You don't trust cable guys.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.320]   That's the last person.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.560]   10-year Verizon.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.560]   I'm now on time Warner.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.680]   Now that I switched over.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:32.800]   I mean, it's not bad.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.240]   Seriously.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.960]   And people who were to Google, I'd
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.600]   worry about Comcast and Time Warner.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.720]   Who is that?
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720]   Some new redstone.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.000]   And some-- you know, he doesn't have any morals.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.520]   They don't have scruples.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.680]   Amazon, they'll turn your right over to the feds.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.120]   Oh, look.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.360]   Homer's got something to say.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.120]   I got to turn him down.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.160]   He said, better than me.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.160]   He is so apropos.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.200]   Amazon hits 97,000 employees, has tripled in size in three years.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.600]   If you look at the graph, Microsoft flated 100,000 Google
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.960]   growing, but not much to 40,000.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.960]   That orange--
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.360]   I'm just like somebody drew this in crayon.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.360]   It does.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.360]   Geekwire.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.360]   Geekwire.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.080]   I think it is crayon.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.080]   Is Microsoft Paint?
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.920]   It's just the stupidest graph.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   Why am I showing this graph?
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.120]   Geekwire.com, you need to get like Excel.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.800]   But I presume the numbers are accurate, and that's big growth
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   for Amazon.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.400]   Now, probably those 100,000 employees, 97,000
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.680]   employees, are a lot of them are warehouse people, right?
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.080]   I would think most of them are probably warehouse people.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:54.080]   You have to think also about what it takes to be able to go
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:59.800]   online right now, like you did with your Chromecast thing.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.000]   Order that and have it to your house the next day.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.960]   Forget what has to happen after it leaves Amazon's facility.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.240]   But all of the-- and you probably remember those videos.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.840]   It's kind of amazing, really.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.360]   How it's all organized.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.960]   It's staffing those and having-- those are 24-hour days, seven-day
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.600]   a week operations that are just-- it's just crazy how they do that.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.000]   So I think a lot of it is the physical people in the warehouses,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.800]   because they're not building that much new software.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.840]   They have their divisions to do the Kindle,
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.520]   and they have a software there, and streaming and things.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.720]   I'm sure that's quite a few people.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.360]   But I don't think this kind of growth is--
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:43.560]   but they are poised to surpass Microsoft now in direct employment.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.600]   They will be bigger than Microsoft in another quarter.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.720]   Kind of a thing.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.280]   Crazy.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.200]   The actual spend on payroll compares,
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.680]   because I think that'd be a better indicator of skilled employees
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.040]   versus kind of the kind of labor, but ultimately,
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.280]   if actually workers are not going to say--
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.080]   Look at the balance sheet.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.080]   That would be a better way to compare.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.680]   But that number may be harder to get.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.720]   They lost, what, $7 million this quarter?
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.840]   And they're going to lose more next quarter, they said.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.360]   Here's a picture of the FedEx employees.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.400]   I'm going to skip ahead to this.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.720]   Did you see this viral video?
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.720]   I haven't seen this.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.240]   This is from Yahoo News, although I
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.520]   think they're stealing it from somebody else.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.560]   Chad, can you find the original video of the FedEx worker?
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.000]   It's actually-- here it is.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.280]   Is this it?
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.920]   No, that's the one of the guy throwing it over the fence.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.280]   This is--
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.360]   Which is also great.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.200]   Which is also great.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.640]   The guy had a security camera, and it was a monitor.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.240]   And the FedEx guy couldn't get it,
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.240]   because he just threw it over.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.080]   Oh my god.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.800]   He hurled it over the fence.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.760]   Which makes me want to get a camera on my front door,
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.520]   so I can see all the antics that all the UPS and FedEx
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.200]   guys are doing.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.040]   I've seen videos of the UPS guy stealing FedEx packages,
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.160]   and videos of FedEx guy stealing UPS packages.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.560]   It'd be fun to record my own.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:06.360]   I thought this was a fake video when I first saw it.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.960]   But in fact, FedEx's respondents said
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.440]   that the employee has been fired.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.240]   Oh, that's only because they saw him.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:12.800]   They caught her.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.640]   Right.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.720]   So every one of these has ads galore in the front of it.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.520]   I knew somebody that worked at a shipping company.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.480]   Let's say that.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:25.200]   And they said, no, we're not at all careful with your boxes.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:33.440]   Give me a link, Chatham, one that doesn't have--
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.040]   You got it?
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.440]   Yeah, see, they all have--
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.080]   There we go.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:36.640]   There it is.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.040]   This is--
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.640]   Oh!
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.160]   I don't like that.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.320]   Throw it in the back there.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.400]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.120]   You know we're in a hurry.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:43.640]   We got to get--
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.440]   We got to move these micro way of ovens.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.280]   They are doing what you think they're doing.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.040]   I don't know what--
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.720]   Oh, this is a scene from my East Virginia--
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.640]   Yeah, so that's the problem is we get this crap in top of it.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.520]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.480]   Here is--
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.840]   So this was apparently a guy who had a camera in a car
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.960]   behind the truck, was watching this,
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.320]   and said, I got a videotape this.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.920]   But it looks like a joke.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.720]   Here it is.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.720]   So this is the actual-- can you get my-- yeah.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.240]   This is the actual piece.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:25.480]   The part of it that surprises me is, how do they even sort this?
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.760]   Like when they're doing the deliveries--
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.360]   There's something-- I thought this was fake,
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.400]   because she's smiling.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.400]   She's laughing.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.080]   He got the truck number intentionally
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:34.960]   so that he could see this.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.160]   But look at what you're saying.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.880]   They're kind of like boxes.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.880]   Maybe they're--
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   Must have been the end of the day.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.640]   And she was just--
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.360]   But this is what you think they're doing with your stuff.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.880]   By the way, yes, this is surveillance video from the NSA.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.800]   I just want to hear that.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.200]   This is why you can't get away with anything.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.520]   She's probably pissed.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.400]   My private-- keep showing it, because she keeps doing it.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.320]   He does, too.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.560]   It's almost like there's a game.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.720]   Like, who could-- look at it.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.680]   They're laughing.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.720]   Who can throw it farther?
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.120]   Watch.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:06.960]   Watch this.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.440]   Watch this.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.800]   I'm going to frisbee it.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.360]   This one-- let's-- this is in here.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.600]   This is a laptop.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.320]   Let's just see how far I can throw that.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.800]   I don't know if she stopped.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.280]   Unbelievable.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.040]   It's a pickup.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:22.600]   Oh, that's why.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.880]   They don't care about how it's sorted, because they're
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.240]   picking stuff up.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.200]   They're picking enough to take it.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:26.680]   Right.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.480]   That's when the--
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.480]   They'll just throw it in the bin, and somebody else will sort it.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.320]   Hey, we've got a couple of Squarespace sites.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.240]   Let me just show these real quick, and then we'll get to--
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.960]   Tom Merritt, what's ahead in the week ahead.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.240]   This is from JC Photos.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.560]   We asked people to tweet out their Squarespace site
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.160]   based in North England.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.560]   Here's Whale Watch House.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.920]   Oh, a vacation rental in medicine.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.760]   Ooh, I want to go there.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.120]   Ooh.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.480]   I'll be calling you.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.000]   Alex McCoy.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.080]   He is a music, education, and trombone performance major
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.360]   at University of Cincinnati College.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.160]   Love that.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.000]   Tiedeye shirt.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:00.840]   Tiedeye shirt.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.200]   Tiedeye shirts.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.520]   Tech and whites, mobile industry trends.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.760]   Or is that--
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.960]   Yeah, it's good other squares.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.800]   So thank you, everybody.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.840]   And I got quite a few more.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.120]   We got like several hundred Squarespace sites.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.920]   Thank you all for tweeting those out.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.320]   We'll get some more of those in just a little bit.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.040]   #TwitSquarespace.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.120]   Tom Merritt is here.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:20.880]   Actually, he was here.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.520]   It was nice to have him up in studio.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.840]   Really miss him.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.760]   You know, Tom?
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.400]   Yeah, I've only met him in person once,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.760]   but he's had me on the other show.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.680]   But you got him.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.180]   A few times.
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:29.920]   I love that show.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.280]   What is that called?
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.400]   Your tech news today.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.360]   Tech news today, that's it.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:33.800]   I heard of that.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.920]   Monday through Friday, 10 AM.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.160]   Pacific, 1 PM Eastern time.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.520]   They'll be covering the week ahead.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.600]   Tom, what's ahead?
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.120]   Hey, thanks.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.480]   Here's a look at some of the things
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.320]   we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead, Leo,
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.440]   for tech news today and other shows.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.040]   On Tuesday, July 30th, Xiaomei, they're
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.920]   sort of the apple of China, are holding a press conference
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.440]   to announce a product-related partnership with 10 cents
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.520]   messaging service QQ.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.600]   Wednesday, July 31st, Yelp has their earnings.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.800]   And supposedly, the Nvidia Shield is going to ship.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.760]   Thursday, August 1st, Google's going to upgrade its SSL
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.920]   certificates to 2048-bit keys.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.960]   At least they'll start the process of doing that.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.080]   Also, on the August 1st, LinkedIn has their earnings.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.080]   Deathcon kicks off and Black Hat wraps up.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.080]   And Motorola has their MotoX press event.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.120]   Friday, August 2nd, Dell makes their third attempt
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   at a shareholder meeting to approve the buyback of Dell
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:26.880]   to take it private.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.920]   We'll see if that stays on schedule.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.200]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.120]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.760]   Previously on "Twit," before you buy--
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.120]   You just twist the throttle and you take off,
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.640]   and it goes quick.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.920]   I would say up to like 50 miles per hour, 0 to 50,
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.960]   is faster than my street bike that I have, my 600cc.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.200]   It's a positive mind as well.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.880]   "Twit Live" specials.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.520]   "Crowncast," the easiest way to bring your favorite online
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.360]   entertainment to your TV.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.840]   Oh, it's a thumb drive.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.000]   Security now.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.720]   Never let a serious crisis go to waste.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.680]   The point is you can use fear.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.000]   People, forces, can use fear to achieve.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.200]   Triangulation.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.000]   I was working in the dining hall serving of being food.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.280]   But I would always say, hey, here's
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.680]   some fine-managed potatoes for you.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.680]   Would you like a pat about it?
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.680]   But I realized in hindsight, they didn't like it.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.440]   Because what they would say is, oh, that's great.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.080]   You ought to be in radio.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.600]   And I always heard it, hey, that's great.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.480]   You ought to be in radio when what they were saying is, oh,
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.160]   that's great.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.240]   You ought to be in radio.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.760]   Get out of here and do it on somewhere else.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.560]   Because this is a safe place we want to eat.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.280]   Twit.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.600]   Now in color.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.560]   Live in color.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.680]   Well, maybe we're going to like it.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:39.040]   So the big Motorola X, Moto X reveal,
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.000]   we will be covering that live.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.680]   Do we know what time that's going to be, Chad?
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.840]   It's in New York City, so it's probably early.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.680]   Yeah, that's why I'm not--
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.400]   Like, wait too early for me.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.880]   Yeah, it'll probably be 3 AM our time.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.760]   We'll drive time in New York.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.640]   So that's coming up Thursday, the Moto X.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   And this is going to be a hot fall season,
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.960]   because we've got an iPhone 5.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.880]   We've got the Note 3 is coming out in September.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.720]   We'll be announced in September.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.640]   I don't know if there could be a live stream of the Moto X.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.080]   We haven't found that out yet.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.720]   But we will talk about that.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:14.760]   Lots of rumors.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.520]   I can't talk about it because I've seen it.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.240]   Play with it.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.960]   And was ND8.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.040]   I hate it.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.560]   But I will be able to talk August 1.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.240]   So you guys, just have a conversation on yourself.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.040]   I'm very excited.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:29.840]   I'm a good friend.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.080]   I think it's going to be grand.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.960]   It looks good in Eric Schmidt's hand.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:41.440]   This is the first phone from Motorola that Google did not--
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.480]   since Google bought them, they released last week
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.640]   New Droids.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.480]   But that was in the pipeline.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.440]   OK.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.240]   No Google influence on those.
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.280]   This is all Google.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.560]   This new one is.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.200]   Yeah, those they didn't have anything to do with.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.080]   In fact, remember, was the CFO, I think, of Google
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.000]   said, we're not real thrilled.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.680]   They got nothing to be excited about.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:09.040]   But I think they are, in fact, fairly excited about this Moto X.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.120]   I want you guys to repeat rumors.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.880]   And I will pull my ear if--
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.480]   Let's see.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.480]   What can you say?
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.120]   3D screen perhaps?
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:21.960]   No.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.920]   I can tell you one thing.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.840]   I can tell you one thing.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.880]   Not everything that is interesting about this phone
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.000]   is leaked out yet.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:27.560]   Really?
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.680]   Hardware wise, you mean?
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.520]   Well, I think it's going to be very interesting.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.680]   And I have a feeling it's going to be fairly competitive.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.440]   There's good and bad.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.960]   But I think it's going to be fairly competitive.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   And I think it's-- what I was telling people on the radio
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.040]   show-- and I don't think this is a violation of my moral
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.200]   obligation, not to say anything-- is I would wait
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.520]   before you buy a phone till you hear what this is.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.920]   That's good.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.600]   I didn't say that.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600]   OK.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.560]   This would be prudent.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.520]   It'd be prudent to wait.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.240]   Well, we'll cover it.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.080]   One way or the other, we'll cover it live.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.600]   And it may just be me finally exploding,
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.600]   because I can finally tell you something.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.760]   It will be a phone this much we know.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.880]   And apparently, somebody's saying it's got magic glass.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.240]   So that's--
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.080]   Magic glass.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.400]   You can't go wrong with magic glass.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.480]   Hey, here's some very, very good news.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.680]   Actually, I'll save this for after the commercial,
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.360]   but some very, very good news.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.480]   The longest running patent troll case of all time
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.000]   is finally dead.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.560]   Ding dong, the witch is dead.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.360]   We'll talk about it.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.040]   You and I should talk.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:37.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.480]   Yeah, we should.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.520]   But I know what you're talking about.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.360]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:40.760]   Exactly.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.840]   We should talk.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.480]   We should talk.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.080]   We should talk.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.840]   But our lawyers have informed us that until the divorce is final.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:52.400]   I showed they brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.600]   I mentioned earlier their fabulous Go to Meeting program.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.200]   Here's another one that really does change the way you do business.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.880]   I use this every week to send audio to the radio stations.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:06.560]   I used to use one of those commercial consumer
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.080]   grade file sharing things.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.600]   I used to send email attachments.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.040]   Neither were good solutions.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.600]   They broke all the time.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.240]   There were all sorts of issues.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.120]   I can get files now out to people in my business.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.320]   I know they got it.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.360]   I know I have absolute control.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360]   I can password protect.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.160]   I can say how long they can download it for a day, a week,
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.680]   a month, a year forever.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.360]   I can say how many copies they can download.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.800]   It couldn't be easier with sharefile.com.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.400]   It is built for business.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.120]   Do not send patient records through email.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.480]   That's illegal.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.160]   If you're a medical professional, this is HIPAA compliant.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.360]   It's compliant with regulations in a great number of industries.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.240]   That's one of the reasons that when you sign up, we ask you.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.040]   By the way, to do that, click that link at the top that says radio listeners.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.480]   Click here.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.480]   Use our offer code Twit.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.680]   When you sign up, they're going to ask you what industry you're in.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:01.920]   That's because it could be customized for a variety of industries from accounting to
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:02.920]   legal.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.080]   That always cracks me up.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:09.600]   When an attorney, you get email from an attorney and it says,
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.000]   if you're not the intended recipient, destroy this email immediately.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.520]   That doesn't work.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:21.840]   That makes me want to read it and print it.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.400]   Come on.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.800]   Even a lawyer, this is so easy, even a lawyer could use this.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.720]   Sharefile.com, send files quickly and securely.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.760]   You could try it free for 30 days when you visit Sharefile.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.880]   Click that radio link at the top of the page.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.240]   I know it's not a radio show, but that's what we got.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.600]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.000]   Your entire company can send large files, big files, two, four gigabytes, as much as
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.640]   four gigabytes, which you cannot send via email.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.040]   I got to bounce back the other day for 10 megabytes.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.760]   I was just trying to send one picture, but now that's why I always use Sharefile.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:58.080]   Even like I met somebody at a restaurant, a cute kid took pictures of the kid.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.320]   I said, I'll send you the pictures and Sharefile made it so easy.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.320]   It's a branded site.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.880]   They don't have to create an account or log in or anything.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.840]   They can just download this stuff, easy for everybody involved.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:09.840]   Try it free.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.800]   Sharefile.com, use our offer code TWIT if you would.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.920]   Iolas, it's a name that will live in infamy.
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.240]   Although when I read the story, I kind of felt like maybe they weren't really patent
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240]   trolls.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:30.560]   Well, these guys are the ones who, of course, all this is in Texas.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.560]   Tyler, Texas.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560]   Tyler, Texas.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.560]   Is that near Austin?
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560]   No, it's East Texas, right?
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.920]   Yeah, it's East Texas.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:44.000]   For whatever reason, the judges in this part of East Texas enjoy this kind of thing.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   No, no, no.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.920]   In fact, the lawsuit that you and I, we don't want to go into detail because our lawyers
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.440]   have told us not to talk about anything.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.480]   But it would be in Marshall, Texas.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.480]   Oh, right.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.480]   That's the one.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:01.000]   And the judge in Marshall thinks he's doing God's work.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.640]   This is why it's hard because, well, in this case, this patent was created by a guy named
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.320]   Michael Doyle, the Iolas patent.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:16.200]   He was working at the University of California, so they have part of this patent.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:24.360]   And he says that he was the first pre-Tim Berners-Lee or the worldwide web to include
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:30.360]   music clips, search features, maps, and embedded applications on a web page.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.760]   He took the web, he says, from a primitive and static world to today's seamlessly interactive
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:35.760]   environment.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   He did it.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.760]   He did that.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.320]   And he sued everybody.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:45.800]   Adobe, Apple, Amazon, Frito, Lay, GoDaddy, Google, JCPenney, JP Morgan, Playboy, Office
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:52.760]   Depot, everybody, Oracle, Texas Instruments, everybody, almost everybody caved and paid
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.080]   him.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.280]   The patent he gris granted was in 1994.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.680]   You know, Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.080]   So it's five years later.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:05.800]   What happens is these patents are written very broadly.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.120]   And so he sued Microsoft.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.280]   They gave him $100 million.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.960]   Go away.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.840]   He sued JCPenney, Amazon, and Google.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.640]   And that was his mistake because they didn't give in.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.080]   They went to court.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:24.760]   The judge in Tyler, Texas, I think the judge threw it out.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.480]   Iolas paid.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.320]   I mean, I'm sorry, Iolas appealed.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.080]   They were ordered to pay their costs.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.440]   They appealed.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.360]   The appeal court has now thrown this out.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:42.480]   But the reason it's tough is because, you know, this guy can make the claim.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.920]   Well, I did invent this and I deserve to be compensated for this.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.880]   And so it's very difficult.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.680]   It's tough to prove it, I guess.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.320]   It's tough to prove that he did or that he didn't.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:59.880]   And so many of the things that he's claiming that he created or that he invented are things
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.800]   that we just take for granted as--
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.800]   It's the web.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.800]   The way the web works.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.560]   The jury, by the way it was a jury trial, as it often is.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:13.120]   The jury was apparently swayed by the fact that Tim Berners-Lee, the guy who invented
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.800]   the web, testified.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.960]   He went to Tyler, Texas, and testified.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.120]   And I haven't been to Tyler, Texas.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.720]   Tyler, I think I've been there.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:26.320]   I hope I don't ever have to go to Marshall, Texas.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.800]   But apparently the judge there, and there's one judge, and this is what happens, is very
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.000]   pro plaintiff.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.520]   He really believes that these guys are the little guy trying to protect their rights
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:43.680]   against big corporations like Oracle and Google who are just robbing them.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.160]   And of course, he probably saw the movie about the windshield wiper guy.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.160]   Right?
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160]   Right.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.160]   And that's a true story.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.960]   There were Mr. Mitten-Will-Gill wipers, Ford or whatever used him, GM, I can't remember
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.520]   who, without licensing him.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.240]   He practically killed the guy.
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.560]   I mean, getting his money out of them.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.240]   Was it Jeff Bridges?
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.800]   He invented them?
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:06.800]   Anyway.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.400]   For his Tucker car.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.400]   The Tucker.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.400]   Mm-hmm.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.600]   So that's a case where the little guy was ripped off.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.320]   Right.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:23.200]   And that's what the patents are, I think, what people hope they will be used for is that
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:29.800]   if somebody comes up with an idea and does something important, that they will be protected.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.280]   But I don't know.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280]   But they threw this out.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.280]   They said, "No, the guy is not."
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.280]   Goodness.
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:35.280]   Not right.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.280]   So that's gone.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.280]   And it was really a hold up against a lot of companies.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.520]   Now, I don't think Microsoft gets its 100 million back.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520]   No, I don't.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:45.320]   Anybody, as far as I know, and if you pay it already, then that's fine.
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:49.040]   But it was only if you held out and didn't.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.440]   And it was just Google, Google, JCPenney.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.800]   No, Microsoft paid, right?
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:57.320]   Google, Amazon, and JCPenney were the three that finally said, "No, I'm taking this to
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.320]   trial."
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.920]   And that's how these guys work, because what they try to do is make the amount of money
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:07.680]   they're asking low enough that it's cheaper to just give them the money than it is to
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.800]   fight it, even though you know they're in the wrong.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.640]   And so for Microsoft, what's 100 million to Microsoft, right?
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:14.640]   Lunch money.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:20.560]   Microsoft did fight him for a while.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.600]   Jeff Bridges did not patent Ridge Mix.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.600]   That was his mistake.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.600]   That was not his thing.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.600]   Not his thing.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.600]   Okay.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:34.440]   We actually have, we've run out of stories.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.640]   I have fewer stories than I have commercials.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.840]   This has never happened before on Twitter.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.720]   Got the Apple stuff.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.000]   Oh, what's the Apple stuff?
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   Thank you.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   Dan Benjamin.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.440]   I guess you're one billion podcasts.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.440]   Are you happy?
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.440]   Yes.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.440]   I think this is excellent.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.520]   Half of them are yours, dude.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.920]   Did you get on that list of, I'm not in the list.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:54.920]   I don't know if I'm...
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.920]   Oh, no.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:56.920]   Maybe I'm in the list.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.920]   Let's go see.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.920]   Twit was in the list.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:02.760]   So Apple celebrating the billions podcast subscription, not the billions podcast, but the
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.680]   billions podcast subscription.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.680]   That's pretty cool.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.240]   Apple always kind of had a love/hate relationship with podcasts.
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.560]   I'm Steve Jobs, it's just guys in their basement blogging.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:16.640]   Well, that sort of was way better.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.520]   You remember when they added it to me.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.960]   You remember when they added podcasts to iTunes, and what a difference that made?
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.440]   It's huge.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.440]   So they celebrated by...
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.440]   Where's the list you're talking about?
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:28.440]   Maybe it's gone now.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.440]   Let me look.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.440]   It's on the iTunes store.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:33.520]   It may be over because this happened last week.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.520]   But they had a big thing.
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:38.520]   They said a billion subscriptions and they listed some of the...
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.400]   Twit was one of the classic podcasts.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.400]   This means I'm old.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.400]   The originals.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.400]   Original podcasts.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.400]   Well, again, my internet.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:52.040]   But you know, if you look at when podcasting first started out in iTunes and the iTunes
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:55.680]   store, there were not that many and you had to go through that.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:00.320]   What was at the time a very long submission process to get your show in there?
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.320]   You remember that?
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.240]   When was your first 2008?
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.240]   I think the first...
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.240]   It was pretty mature by the day.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.400]   2006 is when I did the earliest.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:10.840]   The earliest high-logic podcast thing where I would interview people and we had eight,
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840]   nine people listening.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840]   You still do high-logic.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.760]   I don't update it much anymore.
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:23.800]   But that time period and if you remember, ODO was shut down that day.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.400]   You know, because iTunes came out with it.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.560]   Yeah, that was Dev Williams company that eventually pivoted and invented Twitter.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.560]   It invented Twitter.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.560]   Turned out pretty well for them.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.360]   Yeah, not a bad day, actually, in retrospect.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.880]   But you know, I remember that.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:39.880]   And that opened everything up for people who wanted to say, "How do I get the show that
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.040]   I'm recording which used to be just linked to on my website, which if it wasn't that
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.400]   popular, how would anyone ever find it?"
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.400]   Which is my problem.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.520]   Getting it out there and making it something that was more accessible to people than they
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.600]   could download.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:56.200]   And now, you know, and I don't think there is a bigger marketplace, a bigger marketplace
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.240]   if I can use that word for podcasts than iTunes.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:02.200]   No, no, it's still 90% of our downloads.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.680]   I wish it weren't.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.800]   Because I hate to be dependent on Apple in that way.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.800]   But it's just it is.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   It is.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:13.880]   And it's really one of the best ways for people to find shows too.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   And I agree with you.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.320]   I wish there were better ways or other ways that had the same kind of foot.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.320]   That's why we do live.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.720]   And you do live too.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:23.200]   I don't know if live for you means what it means to us.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.680]   I mean, for us, I want people to just tune in like it's on TV like 24/7.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.200]   You have a scheduled time when you turn on the mic.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:35.360]   If we're not doing a live show at that moment, then you'll hear the reruns, which is kind
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.440]   of where you guys were, you know, three or four years ago.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.440]   We still do that.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.200]   I mean, if you tune in at midnight, then Lee reruns.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.720]   But it's all video all the time.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:50.720]   And the reason I'm thinking of late is that it's kind of like physical media.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:55.520]   The downloading and storing a bunch of shows is okay for certain, you know, like you're
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.520]   going to get on a plane.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.520]   Okay.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.720]   But most of the time, that's too much trouble.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:03.680]   And if you could just go to a place, go to twit.tv on the web and there's like people
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.600]   sitting around talking about stuff you're interested in, that's probably better.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.720]   It's like today's show is always on.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.360]   But there's a huge segment of my listeners I know because we...
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.800]   Well, you have smarter listeners.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.800]   You're more...
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.040]   It's a more intellectual show.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.040]   Well, thanks.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:25.040]   But I think that we, the kind of listeners that we have, I think they're...
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.040]   Whenever we ask them questions...
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.480]   That's just pissed off.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.520]   Everyone's left your chat room.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.560]   That's what we call them, Jack.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.560]   But I mean, your shows are more cerebral, perhaps.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:43.200]   Well, the thing about that is, and what we find whenever we interview the audience by
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.840]   doing listeners, you know, listener polls and things is that they're not...
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.000]   I wish they were more...
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.200]   We had more live listeners.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.200]   I really wish we...
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.200]   Me too.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.200]   I think that's the future.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.720]   But so many of them are listening, you know, as a podcast when they are at the gym or when
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:03.600]   they're driving in their commute or, you know, and the show that they want to hear is recorded
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.320]   at a time that they can't listen, but they don't want to miss it.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.400]   So they come back to it.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.400]   So that's the...
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.280]   I think really the largest aspect of our audience.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.560]   I've started trying to...
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.920]   You have so many live listeners.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.440]   It's thousands tuned into every show, which is crazy.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.440]   Yeah, there's probably...
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.440]   How many bear, how many people are listening right now, do you know?
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.440]   Bear.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.440]   Anyway, he's not...
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.920]   I think he's asleep.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:25.920]   But...
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:29.160]   Yeah, it's five to ten thousand.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:32.720]   And then when there's a live event like the last week's Google event, it's in the hundreds
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.720]   of thousands.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.220]   That's crazy.
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:38.280]   But we can't monetize it because it's hard to demonstrate that number.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:41.120]   A download, you can say, "Hey, this is how many we're downloading."
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.000]   You can show the server log.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   But...
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   I mean, the...
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.400]   But I feel like the glide is to make what you want.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.400]   It is for you too.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.480]   I mean, I would love nothing more than to know that we had shows going on, even if it's eight
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.080]   hours a day, you know, that people could tune into and listen.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.040]   No, that's about what we do, eight or nine hours a day.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.040]   That would be great.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.360]   And what I say is the download is the on demand.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.640]   If you missed it, it's on demand or it's more convenient for you to listen to it at another
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   time.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.640]   Right.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   Because then we have global listeners.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.000]   It's a middle of the night somewhere, then obviously download would be better for you.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.760]   Eventually, I'd love to be 24/7, live 24/7.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.760]   You're getting close.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.680]   Tim, are you still doing any audio or video on the internet?
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.960]   You do stuff with Engadget, I know.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.000]   It was on the Engadget podcast and the Engadget show, of course, back then.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.520]   And it's certainly our numbers kind of match yours in terms of percentages.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:34.840]   You know, a huge percentage came from iTunes or from other artists, subscriptions versus
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:35.840]   live.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.080]   You know, live podcasts would have maybe a couple hundred people, but downloads would
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.600]   be, you know, tens of thousands.
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:41.880]   So it was a huge difference.
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.680]   But, but no, right now, this is, this is it for the moment, actually.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.680]   Good.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.360]   Well, he's got his blog.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.040]   Anytime you want to, he's a blogger.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.040]   He's a blogger.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.400]   Anytime you want to come on, we should have Tim on all the time now.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.400]   Because he's got some free time when he's not racing.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:56.400]   I love Tim.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.400]   Well, we love having you on.
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.400]   So, iTunes.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:02.600]   Now, this is interesting because Apple's always said iTunes is not a profit center or for
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:06.400]   a long time, they said, we break even, we do it because we sell us computers.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.880]   I don't think you can say that anymore.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.200]   iTunes brought in $3.9 billion in the quarter.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:13.200]   Isn't that crazy?
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.520]   That's a lot of money.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.280]   Now, that's revenue.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:17.640]   Do they say what the profit is?
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.640]   They'll never say that.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.640]   They don't break it down.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.080]   They'll never say that.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:24.160]   That's certainly not a number that even Apple can ignore at this point.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:28.360]   I've made that case before too that ultimately Apple can get closer to the point where they
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:31.760]   can start making less margins on their devices because they've got all this profit coming
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.760]   in.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.760]   It just keeps increasing.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.520]   This is a huge number, again, just for Apple.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.240]   I wonder if they could start to think about maybe moving toward the Amazon model.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.240]   I don't think they would.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:45.640]   I mean, strong margins on their devices is a big part of what's made Apple as successful
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.640]   as they are.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.040]   But ultimately, maybe this points to some future devices that maybe have slimmer margins.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:56.400]   Do you mean the Amazon model in the sense that you give away the hardware because you're
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.400]   going to make money when people use it?
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.280]   Or at least have slimmer margins in doing so.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.560]   Or do what they're doing right now, which is make money the whole time.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560]   Everything.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.560]   And on the back.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.840]   Front back, up, down, left, right.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.280]   It's all profit.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.280]   If they're, if they last quarter, it was 4.1 billion.
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:20.560]   This quarter, 3.9 billion total of $8 billion in six months.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.560]   That's revenue.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.560]   It's insane.
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.280]   But you got, they've got to be, even if it's 10% margin, they're making, they're no longer
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.280]   break even.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.520]   No, no longer breaking.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.520]   That's amazing.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:31.520]   It is.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.520]   Wow.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.520]   Forget app sales and things like that.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.600]   And it's got to drive the record industry crazy because basically there's nothing they
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.600]   can do about it.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.160]   They'd love to shut Apple down.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:47.200]   They sold 32.1, I'm sorry, 31.2 million iPhones, more than anybody expected last quarter, 14.6
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.200]   million iPads.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:52.880]   So it's up 20% for iPhones, but down 14% for iPads.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:53.880]   That's right.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.880]   That's because they need a new one.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.880]   They need a new one.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.520]   And the other thing that's really interesting to point out that you're probably about to
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:03.320]   point out is how many of the iPhones are selling are the old iPhones.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.320]   Yeah, is that interesting?
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.320]   Not the new one.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   Only half are iPhone 5s.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.040]   And they're selling so many of what we would call the older iPhones, which is why so many
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:16.960]   people, and that's 30, iPhone 4s is 30% of the iPhone sales.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.440]   People are walking and buying a 4s.
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.440]   Or a 4.
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.440]   Or a 4.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.200]   20% must be 4s.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:29.120]   But that's, well, yeah, 18% in June 2013.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.360]   It's your mom's fault.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.120]   That is her fault.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:38.440]   But this shows that I think that people are ready for some kind of cheaper iPhone.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:40.680]   And this is why we keep, oh, it's going to have a plastic case.
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:41.680]   So it's going to have other.
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:47.920]   And this is because it seems weird because the perception is that the iPhone 4s or the
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.400]   4 is the old phone.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.240]   That's the old phone.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.920]   And people don't want to buy something that's old.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.920]   Like they don't want an old, even though they know it's, yeah.
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:03.040]   But if we, if Apple were to give them something that could play a little bit better down
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:04.040]   market.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.040]   Or modern, but free.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.360]   That was, that was free or that was cheap.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.360]   Maybe we'll have one for you.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:10.360]   Funny colors.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:16.800]   But it's your mom again because she thinks that a $50 iPhone is significantly cheaper
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.560]   than a $200 iPhone.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:24.400]   It's not because the cost of the iPhone either way is the monthly cost over two years, which
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.200]   is thousands.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.480]   So she's saving a few percentage points over the total cost.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.840]   But to her, and this is the price, it's not just her.
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:32.840]   It's everybody.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:38.760]   You know, the issue is what do I pay out the door is more important to them than the
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:42.120]   total cost of the phone, which is thousands.
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.240]   I don't know how you convince people of that.
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.840]   And Ken from Chicago is saying, when is Apple gone for the low priced demographic?
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.040]   When they have it gone.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:55.360]   But I think that they, in this space, this, this may be the time when they do it.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.400]   I'll give you the example.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.520]   I think that's your main is what they did with the iPod.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.720]   They own, they put out the iPod, one iPod, own the space.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.280]   And as soon as they own this space, then they said, okay, let's fill in the nooks and
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.280]   crannies.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.280]   Let's do the shuffle.
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.280]   Let's do the nano.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.280]   Right.
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:09.280]   Very, very big sellers.
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.240]   Let's do the iPod touch.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:17.040]   They completely, they sewed up every category of that market and basically owned all music
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.040]   players.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.120]   And I think that that's potentially what they'd like to do.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:23.120]   I don't think it's possible at this point with any other parallel there too is that those
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:26.200]   devices weren't really pitched as being made to a cost.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.520]   They certainly didn't look or feel like they were made to a cost either.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.160]   They just happened to be cheaper because they had simpler functionality.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:34.840]   And I think that's definitely what we'll see from, you know, if there is a new iPhone
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.240]   coming this far on this lower cost.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:41.640]   I think it'll be played up as a kind of fun looking, maybe smaller, cooler looking device
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:46.440]   for people who want something a little bit more exciting looking maybe that also happens
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.040]   to be at a lower cost.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.000]   And I would bet that cost message is actually going to kind of get lost in the shuffle compared
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.680]   to everything else, at least from the Apple standpoint.
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:57.880]   Everybody else though will pick up on the cost as the main selling point of whatever this
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:58.880]   new device is.
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:33:59.880]   Right.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:03.640]   Tim makes a really good point I think and to extend that a little bit is that if we think
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:07.680]   of it as a cheap iPhone that's kind of like boring and that's Apple.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.720]   Yeah, I don't want it to be like a phone.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:14.160]   If we think of it as the same way you pointed out the Nano, the shuffle, these are very different
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.160]   devices.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:18.960]   If there's a way for Apple to come out with a device that is a phone that's very different
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:24.000]   from the five that differentiates itself somehow in the same way that I think the iPad
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.240]   many differentiates itself from the full size iPad, it's a different device.
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:31.440]   Yes, you can do many of the same things with it, but they're different.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:36.640]   If they were to come out with a phone that was lower cost point, but had other features
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.600]   and maybe it's more fun, maybe it's colors.
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:43.880]   I mean, little things like that, like people really care about getting the colors like
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:48.120]   that's a big deal to people getting a phone that's a color.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.240]   That could be the thing that, oh, it's cheaper, but it's a color and it's whatever I didn't
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.800]   get that one for my kid instead of the full price one.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.800]   It's plastic.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:55.800]   Use an iPhone.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:57.800]   Tim, you use an iPhone.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.240]   I certainly have spent a lot of time with an iPhone, but no, my daily driver is a Galaxy
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.240]   Note 2, actually.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.600]   I like the Note 2.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.240]   I'm looking forward to seeing the Note 3.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.880]   Yeah, I'm very excited.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.440]   I'm going to confess something.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.840]   I'm a little soured on Samsung.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:20.760]   I think the Galaxy S4 didn't improve much and added a lot of cruft.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.080]   Watching your eyes and stuff like that.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.960]   Unfortunately, a lot of stuff didn't really work very well.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.520]   I think it was a lot of great concepts and a lot of interesting ideas of moving the way
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:34.840]   that you interact with your phone forward in a very different conceptual way.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:36.880]   The problem is a lot of it doesn't really work very well.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:41.200]   The motion gestures are okay, but scrolling with your eyes is clunky.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.560]   If you're on a train that's bumping around, it doesn't really work at all.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.760]   It's a great idea, I think, but it just doesn't work quite so well.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.920]   As I use this Nexus 7, I don't have a Nexus 4.
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.920]   A lot of Android people love the Nexus 4, which is a pure Google phone.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:36:01.000]   I used the early pure Google phones and I came to love things like TouchWiz, Samsung's
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.160]   edition because it made it more usable.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:08.040]   But now as I use the Nexus 7, which is back to a pure Google experience, I think Android
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:12.440]   is improved and mature to the degree now that you don't want that carrier stuff on top
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.000]   of it.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.480]   I think more and more people want the pure uniform of the Google experience.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:23.600]   I think somebody would be very smart to make a phone.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:27.480]   I think they could compete successfully against Samsung and even HTC.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:32.680]   I love the HTC One, but it's so weird and non-standard and the buttons are odd that
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:37.080]   if somebody made a pure Google experience phone that was modern and had all the features,
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.080]   I think they might do very well.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:41.640]   No, I agree with you, but the carriers and specifically more of the manufacturers is
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:42.640]   different.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.640]   That's how they want to do it.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.120]   They want to, oh, we have a different thing here that's better and the buttons over here.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:52.600]   It's appealing to some users, I guess, because it looks different, but that's the only way
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.360]   because they're all having to use the same operation.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:56.640]   I think Samsung went too far with it.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.360]   And they've gone down the road and now they've really jumped up.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.360]   And I agree with you, Tim.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.480]   I love the Note 2 and I'm very curious about the Note 3, but if it's loaded up with all
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:09.760]   that Samsung stuff, I think it will be, I think it's pretty inevitable.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:13.680]   And ultimately, we could see even more stuff as they try to make the S Pen, the stylus,
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.080]   more of a useful feature.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.360]   I use the stylus quite a bit.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.200]   I don't really need anything fancy or any more smarts added to it.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:23.720]   I really just need to sign stuff and maybe do the occasional doodle on there too, which
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:24.720]   doesn't hurt.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.280]   But yeah, I think we'll probably see some more smart, some more gestures, some more
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.840]   eye recognition and things like that.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:35.800]   And hopefully it'll be a little bit better implemented than it was on the GS4.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.400]   In a way, I'm rooting against Samsung because they're so dominant.
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.320]   They are now, it's really the market is split, iPhone and Samsung, with a lot of also Rans.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.080]   And I don't want to see anyone become that dominant.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.160]   So I'm kind of hoping that somebody can compete against them strongly.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.600]   And I feel like that because they're so dominant, they're coasting.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.600]   And that's what worries me.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:00.120]   And you're right though, the S Pen is a unique feature that both on the tablets and on the
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:05.880]   phones is a differentiator that's, see, I never used it, but I'm not an artist.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:06.880]   So you really use it.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.440]   Yeah, I've actually started using it for, if I'm doing an interview, taking notes, for
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.440]   example.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.760]   I used to carry a moleskate around with me wherever I go.
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.120]   I used to carry a voice recorder around with me too.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.320]   But now I just use my note to record the voice on there.
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:21.400]   And I take notes right on there too.
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:25.400]   So that's two less things that I have to pack, which if you travel as much as I do,
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.000]   is a pretty valuable improvement.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.040]   So that right there was a really strong buying point for the note to battery life on that.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.040]   It's fantastic.
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.040]   Right.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.040]   That also was a huge.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.040]   Huge.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.040]   That's what I put Skype on the Nexus 7.
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.040]   Really?
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.040]   And I'm so close.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.040]   You know, I have a phone number on it.
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.280]   I'm so close to just saying this is my phone.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.280]   Right.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.680]   Holding it up to your ear like a phone.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.160]   Well, that's not okay.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.760]   You know, a lot.
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.560]   Remember when people in the iPad came out and people were taking pictures of these?
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.560]   Isn't that stupid?
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.560]   Now it's all you see.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.840]   Admittedly, it's still stupid, but it's like, well, we're used to it.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.120]   And when the note two came out, people said, what is that?
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.120]   A Hershey bar?
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.120]   What do you hold up to?
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.120]   You hear?
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.720]   Admit this looks stupid, but I think you could get used to it.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.960]   No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't like making calls in my notes.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.600]   When the audience is shaking, it's not a large head.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:14.600]   And even then I don't like it.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.240]   You don't think that's hot when I do that?
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:17.240]   No, no, they're going to.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.240]   I think you can pull it off.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.080]   I don't know if the regular man on the street can tell.
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:25.960]   Well, the truth is people are using earbuds.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.160]   People don't hold their phone up.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.560]   You don't hear, you don't see that as much anymore.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.560]   Do you?
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:31.560]   People holding their phone up.
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.760]   Not as much, but you know, push comes to shove.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:34.760]   You got to do it.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.760]   You got to do it.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:37.160]   I'm so tempted.
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.280]   I wanted Apple to do that with the iPad Mini.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.880]   Just make it the next iPhone.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:45.560]   Well, that's a perfect segue into your next article here.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:50.400]   That Apple is the one that Apple is testing different sizes.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.320]   Oh, yeah, I don't buy this.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.920]   Well, of course they're testing different sizes of screens.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.080]   Because they're always testing different sizes of screens.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:00.000]   I don't know what they're going to do from what they're testing.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.400]   They should test every single possible size of screen at all times.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.400]   Why not?
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:09.040]   This is the Wall Street Journal, which normally is pretty well placed.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.040]   But I don't know if that is very simple.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.680]   People at Apple Supplier said it asked for prototype smartphone screens larger than its
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:18.680]   current iPhone in recent recent months, and then is asked for screen designs for new tablets
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.600]   measuring slightly less than 13 inches.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.160]   Slightly more than 13 inches.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:23.160]   So what?
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.160]   Half of 13 inches.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.160]   They're probably twice as much.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.160]   Yeah, it means nothing.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:27.160]   It means nothing.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.160]   Of course they're doing this.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.160]   It's crazy not to.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.160]   It's a supplier instead.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.160]   Who's surprised?
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:35.520]   Give me a 10.1 inch screen, give me a 10.2 inch screen, and then each one incremented by a
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.360]   tenth each time, and another waiting to see which size is actually...
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.360]   Samsung did that.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360]   It's still out into the Journalist.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.360]   Samsung did that.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.640]   There's a Galaxy Mini, there's the Note, and everywhere and everything in between.
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:48.360]   Samsung has five or six different sizes of Galaxy phones.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.640]   This would be great for Apple to find out which suppliers are leaking information to
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:52.640]   the media.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.240]   Yeah, that's a great point.
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:59.360]   The 3.74 inch phone.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:00.640]   So I don't think that means anything.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:04.040]   I think Apple's always doing this kind of thing.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.840]   I ignore these stories and I ignore patent stories because Apple patents everything.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.040]   If you've been at patent it, you never know.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:12.520]   It doesn't mean you're going to make anything with it.
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.920]   And move to Texas.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:20.200]   And move to Tyler, Texas.
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.200]   I'm just looking at a picture of Anthony Wiener and just makes me laugh every time.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:29.080]   That's a good one.
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.080]   Stock phone.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.080]   Stock phone.
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:34.000]   You know, you just never can have too much of this.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]   That's the one to use.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.880]   We're going to take a break and come back and we're going to talk about hackers and then
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.880]   we'll wrap it up.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:41.880]   How about that?
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.200]   Dan Benjamin's here, 5x5.tv.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.680]   Tim Stevens from formerly editor-in-chief of Engadget.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:55.520]   He's now blogging at digitaldisplacement.com where you could find out about his races.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:58.880]   First thing I almost don't want to say now blogging.
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:01.720]   First post in eight years, six years.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.320]   I started things up again.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.040]   He has been digitally displaced.
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.560]   When you're in it, you're a chief in Engadget.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:08.560]   Do you write much?
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.040]   Did you write or was it mostly like taking a red pencil to stuff?
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.480]   There was a lot of red penciling going on.
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:17.840]   It was a lot of management and firefighting and problem solving.
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:21.200]   So you probably added a lot of shape for writing.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:26.200]   I definitely did write reviews for the premium devices and I tried to do some event coverage
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.200]   when I could.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.200]   I did as much writing as I could ultimately began.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:31.600]   There were a lot of other things to do that they take me away.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:35.640]   When you left, was it like branded that they take your Google Glass and rip it off your
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:37.440]   head?
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.520]   It was actually broken at the time.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.680]   I just got it replaced.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.720]   So I still have the glass here.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:44.880]   Nobody ripped it off my hand yet.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.760]   Oh, man.
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:47.760]   Sorry.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:54.400]   Audible.com, ladies and gentlemen, wants to introduce you to 340 great college courses.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:59.360]   9,000 lectures from the world's most engaging professors.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.600]   We've talked about Audible a lot.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:04.120]   I'm a huge, as you know, Audible fan.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.880]   Audible, I get entertained by Audible in the car at the gym when I'm washing the clothes
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.320]   and making the bed.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.640]   I listen to Audible all the time.
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.720]   And I've been a fan for years of the great courses.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:19.000]   I subscribed to the catalog and bought many of these great courses.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:25.120]   So I was so pleased when I saw that Audible had made a deal with the great courses to
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.000]   include these as part of Audible.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.880]   So if you go to audible.com/greatcourses, you can see what some of these lectures are.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:37.400]   The one that I just completed last year and really like, these are college professors,
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.800]   actual college courses.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.800]   Whoops.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:40.800]   Did I type the right thing?
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.960]   The wrong thing.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:42.960]   Great courses.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:43.960]   Audible.com/greatcourses.
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:46.880]   Well, maybe the site's not up yet on.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.080]   Oh, because I'm a member.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.080]   I can't do it.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.080]   Okay.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.080]   So members, you can't do it.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.920]   You can just search for great courses.
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:56.960]   And what I did was how to listen to and understand music.
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.600]   Yeah, there's the non-members site.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:02.520]   And it was incredible.
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:05.880]   It's Professor Robert Greenberg, 36 hours.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:09.560]   I think it's something like 20 lectures.
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:14.600]   And he starts with the beginning of classical music with Jaskan Dupre, who I'd never heard
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.240]   of and became a huge fan of.
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:22.040]   These music teaches you about all of this stuff.
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:23.040]   What's a fugue?
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.040]   What's a canon?
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:25.440]   What was bock up to Beethoven?
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.440]   Mozart?
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:29.160]   It's actually 48 lectures.
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:37.680]   And boy, I have a huge new appreciation of music all the way up to Stravinsky.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.160]   But that's just one.
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.160]   They have literally 340 courses on there now.
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:49.800]   In addition to the 100,000 books, literature, history, wellness, music, science, philosophy,
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:55.680]   theology, fill your brain with great stuff by the world's most effective communicators,
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:57.640]   the best professors, the best experts.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:58.640]   And guess what?

[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.200]   The great idea is a philosophy.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:02.440]   Well, I like this.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:07.560]   Your deceptive mind, a scientific guide to critical thinking skills, Professor Steven Novella.
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.720]   Wow, that would be cool.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:12.200]   Maybe you're into physics.
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:17.760]   You want to learn about Einstein and the quantum revolution for non-scientists?
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:22.560]   Professor Richard Wolfson, you can get this for free.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:23.560]   So here's the deal.

[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:49.280]   a cultural culinary history.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.560]   I love this.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:46:00.760]   Espionage and covert operations, a global history by Professor Lulevicius.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.480]   Even his name sounds mysterious and evil.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:07.680]   Mimi Guarnari, who is really great at the science of natural healing.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:10.480]   The science of critical decision-making, the secret life of words.
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:12.960]   See, I want to listen to every one of these, but then I wouldn't have time to do this.

[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:24.520]   And we thank him so much for this.
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:27.280]   You can't help the laugh.
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.280]   It's funny.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.280]   It's just a good picture.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:33.200]   It was apparently a Wall Street Journal on the appeal of embarrassment.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:37.520]   I don't be the guy that takes that photo.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.000]   It's funny.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000]   He's hot.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]   Carlos Danger, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000]   Hot.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.200]   Actually, this is kind of a sad story.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.560]   So Barnaby Jack, who was a hacker, he was on his way to the Black Hat Convention.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:53.240]   He was going to present, and maybe this was just karma.
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.400]   He was going to present techniques for attacking pacemakers, implanted heart devices.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.000]   Could kill a user from 30 feet away.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000]   He died.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000]   He was 35.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000]   I know.
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.240]   He's 35 years old.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.240]   Authorities are investigating.
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:09.280]   They don't know the cause of death.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:11.120]   He does not have a pacemaker.
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:12.120]   He did not.
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:13.120]   Do you know that?
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:14.120]   No, I'm asking.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:15.120]   I don't know.
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.120]   I don't know.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.120]   I believe he did, actually.
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:18.120]   What, really?
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:19.120]   Did he?
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:20.120]   I thought he did.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:29.880]   Apparently, there are 350,000 pacemakers in use in the US, 173,000 implantable cardio-verter
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:32.760]   defibrillators.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:35.560]   And these are wireless devices that are apparently hackable.
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:40.920]   I am hoping that he took the hack to his grave, but I don't know.
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:46.480]   My understanding is that the way that now that they adjust these things is through some
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.160]   kind of wireless connection so that if you need to have it modified, if it's beating
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:53.160]   at the right speed or whatever, you attach it.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:58.160]   And instead of having to physically attach something, you Wi-Fi into it or something,
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:00.040]   which is also weird.
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.880]   But who knows what happened there?
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:02.880]   That's sad.
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:06.640]   No kidding.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:09.400]   And Chipotle faked its Twitter hack.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.400]   Right.
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:11.400]   Really?
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.400]   Did you read that?
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.400]   Were you paying attention?
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.920]   So it wasn't that crazy.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.280]   People were talking about it as the most insane thing that ever happened.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.280]   No.
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:24.000]   It was the first tweet was Mittens' 13 password leave.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.320]   Right.
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:28.640]   And then end Twitter.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:34.080]   Those feel like somebody was typing into Hootsuite or something and not realizing that it was
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.960]   sending those to Twitter, right?
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.920]   That's what that feels like.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:38.920]   So it's good.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:39.920]   It made sense.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.680]   Then the ones that say, "Hi, sweetie.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.880]   Can you please pick up some lime, salt, and onions?"
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:45.920]   Twitter, that's obviously like...
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:46.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:47.920]   Or what is cilantro?
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:48.920]   How do you pronounce it?
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:49.920]   That's obviously fake.
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.560]   It just seems silly.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:52.560]   I think this is what happened.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:53.720]   Did it work for them?
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:55.920]   Well, I guess we weren't covering it.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:56.920]   Got attention.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.960]   I think the first two really were.
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:00.960]   Somebody blew it.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.720]   And it was typing in what they thought was one window or like some intern couldn't figure
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:11.720]   out how to exit the content management system that posted to Twitter and typed Mittens'
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.800]   13 password leave.
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.000]   And then end Twitter and then gasped and said, "Oh my God.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.440]   These were tweeted."
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.040]   And then somebody came over and said, "No, no, I'll take care of it."
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:24.040]   Right.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:27.880]   We'll just pretend that that was all intentional and we'll start typing about avocados.
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.920]   In our vada.
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:31.920]   So I think it's both.
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:32.920]   I think somebody...
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:36.720]   I think some intern started as a real crisis, turned into a marketing.
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:38.720]   They say, "Oh no.
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:42.120]   It was a publicity stunt tied to our 20th anniversary."
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:43.400]   We'll never know.
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:44.400]   We won't.
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.480]   Plus they have the GMO food anyway.
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:47.480]   Is it?
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.480]   Oh, I'm not eating there anymore.
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.480]   Well, some of it's not.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.480]   Some of it is.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.480]   Really?
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.480]   Oh, wow.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.480]   The carnitas, I think you're all right.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.480]   The carnitas are real pigs.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.480]   The carnitas are okay.
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:01.720]   That's not like some laboratory.
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:05.160]   Did you see there's a guy who's...
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:06.400]   You're into paleo, right?
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.400]   Oh yeah.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.400]   People don't know this.
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.400]   Dan Benjamin was about 440 pounds.
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.240]   He was like, "He was my size."
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.880]   And then only started eating steak day in day.
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:17.360]   That's right.
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.360]   Steak and eggs.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.800]   I've always thought that, and maybe you could do this, there should be...
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:23.960]   You know how Purina has horse chow, dog chow.
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.880]   It's perfectly formulated.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:26.880]   Everything a dog needs.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:27.880]   A human chow.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.840]   So like, soiling green or something.
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:33.120]   Well, there's a guy who is actually making soil it.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.000]   He's invented the perfect human food.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000]   Right.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.600]   And he calls it soil it, which I think is a bad idea because it's not made of humans.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.600]   And they raised...
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:42.600]   They...
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.600]   $800,000.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:44.600]   He's raised for this.
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:46.520]   She called it bachelor chow.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:47.520]   Is it...
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:48.520]   But it's soy something.
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:51.640]   No, there's no soy in it.
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:54.360]   It's just badly named because soil like green is made of people.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.680]   This is for people not made of people.
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:00.720]   But I like, I mean, if there were something I could eat like you could just get...
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.800]   I could have a scuba day of human chow.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:08.200]   And then I wouldn't have to think and I would be thin like Dan.
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:09.200]   I would eat that.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:10.200]   Sure.
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:11.200]   You would eat anything.
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.200]   Sure.
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.200]   What do you eat?
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.200]   Bacon and eggs for breakfast.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.200]   Bacon and eggs for breakfast.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:16.200]   Bacon and eggs for breakfast.
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:18.440]   Sometimes a burger with no bun or something like that for lunch and then dinner.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:19.440]   Did you lose...
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.440]   Were you fat at one point?
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.440]   I mean, I was never...
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:22.440]   You weigh how much?
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:23.440]   105?
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:26.800]   I probably weigh 140.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:27.800]   No.
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:28.800]   No.
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.800]   135.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.800]   Really?
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:31.800]   Tiny guy.
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:33.800]   But I'm totally ripped.
[01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:34.800]   Like it's crazy.
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:35.800]   Let me see the six-pack.
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:36.800]   Nah, I'm just kidding.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.800]   It's the end of the mind.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:39.800]   The radio.
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:40.800]   Yeah, radio.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:41.800]   Yeah, it's radio.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:43.800]   No, it's...
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.320]   You know, it definitely for me it was more of a health kind of a thing.
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:51.800]   I had like, I was a vegetarian and I jogged like five times a week.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:56.280]   And I had hypoglycemia and high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.280]   Even though.
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:59.920]   And I went to the doctor and he said, "Oh, you should eat lesser ed meat."
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:01.480]   I said, "I don't need any red meat."
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:02.480]   More red.
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:03.480]   He said, "Eat less."
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:04.480]   Because he didn't know.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.480]   He didn't know.
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:06.480]   And I said, "I eat none."
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:07.480]   And he said, "Well, you should exercise."
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:08.720]   I said, "I jogged five times a week."
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:09.720]   Dude, you're going to die.
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.720]   And so I switched and started going, "I went paleo."
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.320]   And for me, it was very helpful in all the things that were problems.
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.320]   And all those numbers went.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320]   Got better.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:21.040]   And I'm like, "So it's not genetic."
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.000]   Your parents are still alive and all that.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.640]   It's just my parents are still alive.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:26.640]   Because I eat paleo.
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:27.640]   Because of you.
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:28.640]   Anyway, I want this.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:33.640]   Although this guy apparently knows nothing and it's made out of like maltodextrin.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:36.680]   It doesn't sound healthy to me.
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:37.920]   It's not.
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:40.040]   I don't want to drink that.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.640]   The register lived on it.
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:45.520]   Somebody at the register tried it for a week.
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:48.240]   He said, "We didn't lose weight, but we didn't go crazy."
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.400]   And we haven't felt hungry.
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:53.440]   Although we did lust after real food, which is about what I would expect.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:55.000]   I see this is like an alert.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:00.240]   It's in a packet and you have it in your backpack or something or your purse.
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:03.840]   And like you realize you're going to be without food, crack this thing over.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:06.480]   You drink this, you can last another three hours.
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:07.480]   You're all right.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.480]   Well.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.480]   Did you do paleo though for a while?
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.960]   I still kind of do it.
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:14.600]   But the problem is every once in a while, I'll then have like a pizza.
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:16.600]   The whole thing.
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:17.600]   The whole thing.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:18.600]   Okay.
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:21.200]   No, I've done it for a while and I really believe it.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.480]   Steve Gibbs is a huge believer.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:26.800]   But I unlike many who've had great results, it is individual.
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.680]   I did not have those great results.
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:30.200]   I was in ketosis.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:33.280]   My breath smelled bad, but I wasn't losing any weight, so I just gave up.
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:34.280]   It's different for everybody.
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:35.280]   It is.
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:36.280]   Your body is right.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:37.280]   Their own balance is different.
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.880]   I'm not telling anyone to do it.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:39.880]   No, no.
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:40.880]   Steve Gibbs do it.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.960]   Anyway, this guy raised $797,000.
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:46.600]   He was only asking for $100,000.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:47.760]   He's got $6,000 for it.
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:49.120]   But see, this is what I'm saying.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:50.960]   People want human chow.
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:53.000]   It doesn't even look good.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.240]   Does he talk about what it is?
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:56.920]   It doesn't look good.
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:59.320]   It really doesn't look good.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:00.880]   And he's just making it up, right?
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:01.880]   He doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:03.120]   No, he's not a scientist.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.120]   That's the key.
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:05.120]   You need a scientist.
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:07.800]   It's just this guy.
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:08.480]   He is a wise-
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.480]   He's an electrical engineer.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.480]   He's electrical engineer, so that's good.
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:12.200]   That's what I want my food from.
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:16.560]   You know, it looks like his teeth are about to fall out.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:17.560]   I'll be honest with you.
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.800]   I think there's a lack of calcium or something.
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:20.560]   He looks fine.
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:23.120]   Anyway.
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:25.120]   Soilent.
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.120]   He's thin.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.520]   It's soilent.
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:29.320]   The Apple Developer Center is back, Leo.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:29.840]   Excited.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:30.680]   No, is it back up?
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:31.680]   It's back.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:32.680]   Yeah, it came back.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:33.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:34.680]   When did it come back?
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:35.680]   This is a huge problem.
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:36.680]   Friday, it came back.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:38.360]   So developer.apple.com.
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.680]   And then if you clicked on the iOS dev center--
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:42.680]   Yeah, member center.
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:43.680]   Yeah, or any of those.
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:47.520]   You'd get a thing that said, sorry, we're down because we were hacked.
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:53.440]   Eight days, apparently they rewrote the software, re-jiggered the database.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:55.960]   There was a massive flaw, apparently.
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:58.880]   I have seen-- and I don't know if it's true.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:05.040]   I remember the guy who first exposed this Turkish guy, Baloch, I think it is.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:10.680]   I have seen logs that show that whoever hacked this got certificates.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:11.680]   Interesting.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:13.880]   That's the concern.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:19.520]   I think Apple must have this concern because you are about to ship iOS 7, like in the next
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.760]   few weeks.
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:22.360]   The dev center is down for eight days.
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:25.000]   You only do that if it's absolute crisis mode, right?
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.640]   Can you imagine what that data center in those?
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:29.480]   It has to have been really bad.
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:34.400]   So the greatest fear is, you know, Apple, the way Apple works, if you want to have an
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:40.400]   app on the App Store on OS 10 or in the App Store on iPhone, you have to have a developer
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.840]   certificate that certifies that you are the developer who wrote this.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:49.680]   Apple, kind of, by doing that, Apple is protecting end users.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:55.200]   In fact, you can set your machine that it cannot open or install an app that isn't certified
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:56.840]   by Apple.
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:00.920]   Most people have the default setting, which is Apple will warn you and say, "Hey, you
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.040]   know, this isn't certified.
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:03.400]   You just downloaded this from the web.
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:04.840]   We don't know who this is."
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:07.120]   You can override that by right clicking.
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:14.440]   But if these certificates leaked out, that means malware could then pose as a legitimate
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:15.440]   program.
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.840]   That would be very bad.
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:20.800]   Would be extremely bad.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:22.320]   Apple's not talking.
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.640]   They were a little bit forthright at least saying, "Yeah, we got hacked.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:31.160]   I'm actually somewhat concerned that this is a larger issue, but we may never know."
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:32.160]   We won't know.
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:33.160]   That's for sure.
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:34.160]   We won't know.
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:40.400]   I know a lot of Apple developers, both iOS and Mac developers, and these people have
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:42.680]   been in some cases just completely derailed.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:44.160]   They can't update their app.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:45.800]   If there's a problem, they can't do anything.
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:46.800]   They can't get into them.
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:51.680]   It takes a lot when you're literally just a few weeks away from release.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:54.560]   Then you also have certificates expiring and things like that.
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:58.000]   Developers certificates could expire, as you explained.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.680]   Identifiers profiles, all of this stuff.
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:03.360]   Of course, even things like being able to submit bugs.
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.520]   That was all gone.
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:09.640]   Being able to go in and download a beta that might have come out, you couldn't download
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:11.680]   betas of Mavericks or of iOS 7.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:15.600]   There's been speculation this might hold up iOS 7 and maybe even hold up the iPhone.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:16.600]   You think so?
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:17.600]   Wow.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:20.360]   I mean, I'm going to say no.
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:21.360]   I don't think so.
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:24.680]   Tim follows this probably even better than I do.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:27.520]   No, I don't think it'll hold up the iPhone.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:31.080]   I think this was as much an issue on a desktop as it was on mobile.
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:35.840]   I don't think unless they had to rip a lot of developers away from other projects, which
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:39.080]   I'm sure they did to some degree, I don't think it would have derailed things so badly
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:40.480]   that they'd have to push things back.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.160]   Even if they did, it would only be by one week, which at this point I'm sure they can
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:46.320]   float if they need to.
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:50.080]   Maybe things will come in a week later than Apple had wanted them to be, but no, I don't
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:55.680]   think they'll miss the fall shipping season by any means for either iOS 7 or for the new
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.200]   iPhone or iPhones.
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:02.160]   And the chatroom has passed along the breaking news story.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:07.000]   Many actors, a lot of effort, a lot of work into living a character.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.720]   Remember Robert De Niro gained weight for raging, like 60 pounds.
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:15.080]   Sylvester Sloan learned English for Rocky.
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:18.840]   So it's really, it's something that people really didn't not well, but he learned it.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.680]   It's something that people really take seriously.
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:25.920]   Apparently Ashton Kutcher spent three months learning to walk like Steve Jobs.
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:34.360]   That is the dedication that he put into that movie, which I think will be the worst movie
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:35.360]   of the year.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.360]   No, I have.
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.360]   I've only seen the trailers.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:40.000]   The trailer just now told me he was going to see it.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000]   There's their Friday night.
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000]   He has seen it.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000]   I got to ask him.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.760]   He has seen it.
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:49.720]   Just from what I've seen it.
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:54.800]   Well first of all, remember it debuted at Sundance like a year ago, and then they pulled
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:57.200]   it back, which is always a bad sign.
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:00.280]   It's coming out August 16th.
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:09.040]   But watch, I'm just saying when Ashton Kutcher walks, notice how he lifts his feet.
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:12.800]   And apparently, no, this is good.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:17.960]   I see that Steve Jobs walked funny because he used to walk barefoot a lot and he didn't
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.120]   want to stub his toes.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:23.120]   So he got very good at lifting his feet off the ground.
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:26.320]   And Ashton Kutcher really brings that to life.
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:27.320]   Really?
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:29.160]   Method acting is what they call that.
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:30.160]   Yes.
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:34.440]   Kutcher says, "I loved a man I never knew."
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:35.440]   Wow.
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:39.000]   Well, on that note, I think it's time to move on.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:44.840]   I want to thank you for coming up and refer everybody to 5x5.tv.
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:45.840]   Thank you.
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:49.520]   Stan Benjamin's site, where he does more shows than we do.
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:54.560]   At the beginning of this show is 42, it is now 48 shows.
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:55.800]   It's amazing.
[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:57.040]   I don't know how he does it.
[01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.040]   How many?
[01:59:58.040 --> 01:59:59.040]   32?
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:00.040]   32.
[02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:01.040]   It's gone down.
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:02.040]   You're canceling shows?
[02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:09.360]   Yeah, we've got rid of like 10 shows just flipping the last two hours.
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.360]   Is it Hadi?
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.360]   Yes.
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:13.360]   Is it active shows Hadi?
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.360]   Active.
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:19.960]   So you're not including the hipstomatic or whatever it is that you used to do?
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:23.960]   No, no, that's only maybe the number we gave you initially was all shows.
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.960]   All shows.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.600]   Ever, total shows and now these are current live shows.
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:28.760]   But thank you for the reference, Leo.
[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:31.080]   I wouldn't be able to do the stuff I do without you.
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:32.320]   Because you're stealing all my hosts.
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:33.320]   But that's okay.
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:34.320]   I mean, one by one.
[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:35.320]   You line them up on that.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.320]   It goes over there.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:37.320]   And he and I go over there.
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:42.480]   Gina Trapani is doing a show with Kevin and Bertie, which is called...
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.480]   That is in beta.
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:44.480]   Well, in beta.
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:45.480]   It's in beta.
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:46.480]   Referring to it.
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:47.480]   That's the show's name.
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:48.480]   That is common.
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:49.480]   That is quote.
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:50.480]   Yes.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:51.480]   Underline in beta.
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:52.480]   Yes.
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:53.960]   Back to work with Merlin Mann.
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:55.120]   I knew him once.
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:59.680]   Well, he, the guy who used to be Merlin Mann, he was formerly Merlin Mann.
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:01.480]   Formerly known as Merlin Mann.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:02.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:03.480]   What we call him Prince now.
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:04.480]   He wants to be called Prince.
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:06.480]   He has a symbol.
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:07.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:08.480]   Zeldman doesn't show there.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.480]   Lots of people.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:13.280]   Really, especially if you're into Max web design developing.
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:14.280]   It's a great place for that.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.280]   5x5.tv.
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.280]   Thank you for that.
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:19.520]   Tim Stevens will be racing at a track near you soon.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:22.680]   Watch for him in his Mark II Toyota.
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:23.680]   And look again.
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:24.680]   MR2.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:25.680]   Not Mark II.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:27.080]   MR2.
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:30.200]   And anything else you want to tell us about?
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:31.680]   The blog is digitaldisplacement.com.
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:32.680]   All right.
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:33.680]   What do you do?
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.920]   Are you going to just post a lot of stuff there?
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.280]   Is it just kind of a place to stay in touch?
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.400]   Just to stay in touch is I have time.
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.280]   I do have a review that's going to be going up there.
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.080]   Maybe tomorrow, maybe Tuesday of something before wheels.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:48.720]   But I'm going to do some posting there, some editorializing and some stuff just to keep
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.440]   myself busy and keep the fingers limber as I wait to see what's next.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:57.120]   And right after the show, Dan and I are going to leg wrestle to see who gets rights to Tim
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:58.120]   Stevens podcast.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:01:59.120]   All right.
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:00.960]   I hope you let me tune in for that.
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:01.960]   I'm working.
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:04.960]   I have massive thighs.
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:05.960]   Wow.
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:14.160]   And we do twin every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:16.800]   That is 2200 UTC on Twit.tv.
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:18.280]   Do tune in live if you can.
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:21.680]   As I said, live is important to us mostly because we just like the interaction with
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:22.680]   the audience.
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:27.640]   And it's so much fun to watch the chat room and visit with you as we're doing the show.
