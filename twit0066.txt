[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   This is Trix, this weekend tech, Episode 66 for August 13, 2006. A little dabble do you.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   I am thrilled. I am jazzed beyond belief to get a new voice unto it. We've been doing a lot of the new folks, which is fun.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Of course we've got the traditional. So let me start off with the regulars and we'll get to the new voice.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   John C. Devorect.org/blog. He's here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Hello, the original cranky geek. I don't know why, but I just get the feeling, because I hear John muting on me his mic,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   that he's actually having elaborate conversations in the background, and every once in a while he says something,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   and he goes back to his real life. Hello. I don't know why I get that feeling, John.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Also here, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Herron.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Hey, hey. The king of the widescreen. You ain't kidding.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Knee deep. Knee deep. You're doing another buyer's guide for PC Master.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   This one for liquid crystal displays, the flat panels.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We'll find out what you think of those. Plasma. Now I've got to go show the LCD some love.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I told Patrick that he's welcome. He said, "You want me today?" I said, "Yes, but I don't see him, so when Patrick shows up,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   we'll invite Mr. Norton in, but let me introduce our newbie, first time Twet.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Man, you may remember from call for help. He was a regular talking about the Macintosh.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We met him at Mac World Magazine. It's Brett Larson. Hey, Brett.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Hey, Leo. Good to be here. Oh, it's good to talk to you. You're in New York City now.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'm in New York City. You still at the job you took? You left us to take?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Still at the job I left you all for.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Which wasn't that long ago. As you look back, probably thought, "Gee, what a good idea."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Yeah, it was. I was correct in my assumption that the band would keep playing.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Not that. The whole thing would collapse after you left.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yeah, and everything would collapse after a lot. So where are you?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I'm now working for CBS News in New York. And you're their tech guy.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I do technology coverage. Yes. And actually, I do it for a local station here and a local station in Sacramento.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Oh, I know that. You formerly UPN now CW.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Is that Brandon? That is Brandon Mercer. You're looking for Brandon Mercer?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Mertec TV-er. And doing both the Saturday and weekday early shows.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   How do you do that by a satellite? Yes. That's cool.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I come in on the bird, as it were. The bird. It's kind of fun.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Brandon has a little conclave of former tech TV-ers up there.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Maddie works for him, doesn't she? He does. Kim's up there.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Kim. Our former producer, line producer for the screen savers. That's neat.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Only faces I recognized.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Well, let's get to the news. Now, I know you're going to have some stuff to say about the Mac in just a little bit.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   But before we do anything, I think we should commemorate, as we have done in the last few to its, an anniversary.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So remember, we talked about the 15th anniversary of the inner narrow, the worldwide web, 10th anniversary of Flash.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   August 1981. 25 years ago, something important happened in technology.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   We have anything to do with IBM. It might have the first time in the ABC, the 5150.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It cost $1,565, but that's because it didn't come with any drives.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It came with 16K of memory and a cassette port.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Woo-hoo! Wow, it's right.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Yeah, remember the cassette port.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Do you know what I was wondering? Does anyone remember that used the Kansas City Standard or not?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   What are you talking about, Kansas City Standard?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Is that a cassette data standard?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Kansas City.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   John, do you still have your 50s?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It was called the Kansas City Standard. That was the upgrade to the old, whatever.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   There were some original ones that came on.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Then the Kansas City Standard were up the ante, and it was like the high speed.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   My Atari would make, and I think the apples would make noises they read in the tapes.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Did the IBM do that also?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Well, you could use any drive that had kind of, you were looking for a monophonic drive, like a radio shack,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   and you would push the buttons manually and you would load the data from this thing.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It wasn't like a tape drive that was controlled by the computer necessarily.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Right.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It was like, you know, you had it going into this port and you pushed the button and it would load the data, maybe.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It was not very reliable, I have to say.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah, I disagree with that. I never had a problem with reliability of those things.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Well, fortunately...
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   If you had the right cassette player, they were quite reliable.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Fortunately, they came out with a floppy and a hard drive very soon after.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I'm sure that cost them thousands of dollars at the time.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Actually, the floppies were available immediately.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Were they?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   These things were built like tanks.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I mean, literally, they were steel, sheet steel.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Well, they didn't...
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I had an 8088.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Which one was this?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yeah, this was an 8088.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Okay.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   It was 4.77 megahertz.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Well, that's cool as my Atari though.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   That's a 4.25 years ago.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   This was 4.77, not gigahertz, not megahertz.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Yeah, well, that's pretty fast for those days.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   The fastest chips before that were like a megahertz or something like that.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Less than that.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yeah, the 6509 that ran in the Apple, I think, was 1.something megahertz.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   That's what the Atari had. It was like 1.4.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Really, amazing, really.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I just thought we'd mention that.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Ray Aussie said last week, it's the end of the PC era.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Here we are 25 years later.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I don't know if I agree with him on that.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   What's he talking about?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   What's that supposed to mean?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   He told Microsoft shareholders of the meeting that the PC era was coming to an end.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   "We are now in a new era," said Mr. Aussie, "an era in which the internet is at the center of so much that we do now with our PCs.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   It's important to start them from a different vantage point."
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I don't know what that means.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   He still used the word PC in that sentence.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I don't think he knows what that means.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I don't know how to subscribe to that notion in any way, shape, or form.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I don't think Microsoft should be above all people.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   PCs are going to stick around.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Yeah, Microsoft makes us living on PCs.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   How could they say the PC is dead?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   You know, I see.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I kind of think that the sales started to slide on PCs.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   People let not buy PCs anymore.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   No, they're going back to think they're going back.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   They're still a growth industry.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   How can they be dead?
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   What do you think, Brett?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Well, now that my Skype is back, the application has unexpectedly quit.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   You're with us.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You are with us.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I don't know how you're transmitting.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I'm here.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Continue whatever you're doing.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I was going to say, I do kind of think the PC is on its way out.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's going to be replaced by devices that do specific tasks, like we've seen with the Tivo.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Because the whole media center thing, I don't think people want a computer.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   That's a bad idea.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Which of course is ironic because all of us who have DVRs from the cable company and the Tivo's,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   those are computers, but their computer part of it is hidden from us.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   You don't look at it as though it's the same thing as you have sitting on your desk.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You're saying the appliance computer will take over.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I think the appliance computer will take over.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Hopefully somebody will do it right so they can all talk to each other.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   You're talking more specialized software.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Well, in hardware too.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I mean, a Tivo is a specialized hardware and software combination.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It's a Linux box, but it still is a computer, but you don't know that.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It is a computer.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I challenge this.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's really good.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's a consensus.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   This is crazy talk.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Crazy talk.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   There is a lot of room for improvement in the software experience for everyone.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   That is operating systems generally are too complicated or they're just simply here.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Who here uses Windows Media Center regularly?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Every day.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   You do.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Really?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Because he's an early adopter and he's geeky.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   My neighbor is also just the nadest version of Windows you can buy.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Oh, so do you use it as a Tivo?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I'm not here at home.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I have a Tivo for that, but I do use it at work for that very thing.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And it also just happens to link very nicely with the Xbox 360.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Well, I've heard that's nice.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I've heard the Xbox 360's with the iPod too.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It does.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   It's just too damn noisy.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   So should we move on to kind of a more current topic or should we just?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I'll leave this to you, John, because you're the conscience of the group.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   PC World did do the top 25 greatest PCs of all time.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And it's kind of a fun list if you're into this history thing.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Should we run through a few of these?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Well, I would like to because I'm sure if it's from PC World is incredibly inaccurate.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Well, see how you feel about this.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Number 25.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   They're the enemy.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Number 25, the KPro2.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   See, I don't know why not the Osborne, which really the KPro is just a copy.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Well, do they have the Osborne on the list?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Oh, well, maybe they do.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Maybe they do.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It's not in...
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I don't know if it's a chronological order.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Let me see.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   No, it should be in order of importance, which you may be...
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   KPro2.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   That's coming in at number 25.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I can't find this thing anywhere under this website.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   It's the tubes.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   They're clogged.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Alienware Area 51 is number 21.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Gateway destination.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Let's not forget.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   That was the first big TV member in the...
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Oh, that shouldn't even be on the list.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   That shouldn't even be on the list.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Listen, I'm glad to see Apple's e-mate is on there.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   E-mate is number 20.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Ground breaking.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   21 or 22.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And long gone, I hope.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   The OmniBook 300, that was a pretty cool laptop.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   That was the one with the mouse kind of popped out and was still attached.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It was like an a lever on an arm.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Toshiba T1000.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   A great laptop.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Remember that?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   TRS Model 80.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   You're right.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It's not in...
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Okay.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   The CRS 80 was awesome.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Atari 800.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Hold on there.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Stop the press.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So we're just counting anything that was ever a computer, because the Tandy TRS 80 Model
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   1 was not a PC.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   No, they should say computer, because they had Taris on there as well.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Same thing.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It's not a PC.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   It wasn't a KPC.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   What do you mean?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   It's not a PC.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   It's not an IBM PC compatible.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Yeah, we're talking about this as an anniversary of the IBM PC.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   So what do we have, you know, all these machines that have nothing to do with IBM?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   What's this one here?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   No.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Personal computer.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And number one of the IBM greatest PC as an Apple, is that what this list is?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Oh, let's see.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   That'll be interesting.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   The Mitzel tier comes in at number 12.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   The Sony Vio 505, which was a really lightweight slick machine, number 11.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   The PowerBook 100, number 10, Columbia data product.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Wait a minute, Columbia data products, MPC 1600.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   You remember that one, John?
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Yeah, I do.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   But that didn't be on anybody's list.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Did Morrow design that one?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   No.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   They should have the more.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   So Morrow, you should be talking about it.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   So Morrow should be on here.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   TRS Model 800 is a number eight.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Now, the TRS 80, apparently, it's, you know, model 100 is important.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Hey, John, you'll like this.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Number seven, the Amiga 1000.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   That's a good machine.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Number six, the original IBM PC we're just talking about.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Number five, the ThinkPad 500.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Number four, the Apple Mac plus.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Oh, please.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Oh, that was a great one.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I have one of those.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Number three, the Xerox 8010.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Oh, brother.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Number two, the compact desk pro 386.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And ladies and gentlemen, drumroll, please.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   The number one greatest PC of all time, according to PC World magazine, John, you're going to hate it.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   It's laughable.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   The Apple II.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I agree.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I mean, this is laughable.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   What kind of a list is it?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   The greatest PCs of all time.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Oh, you're not even PCs!
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   It's one of PC Mag...
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   It's a PC World.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   You know, they should be PC-centric.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Where's the Sol 20?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Where's the North Star?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   If you're going to throw in all these old clunkers like the Apple II.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Come on, this sucks.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   You know, PC World's been doing that lately a lot.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   In fact, I think they said their favorite PC was a Mac.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Some time ago, didn't they?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Well, maybe they should all just go to Macs and change the name of the magazine.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Okay, here's what we have to do.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   The crew that does twit, the group of us, we're going to put together a little website, and
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   we're going to do the real top one.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Let's do that.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   What would your nominees be, John?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Well, the first one would be at the top would be you have to give credit where credit is
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   due, which is the IBM PC would be number one.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   The greatest PCs.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Give me a break, historically.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And what about the PC-80?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   That was a very important PC.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   The AT is on there list.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Not even on there list.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   No, it's on there list.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Somewhere down there.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I skipped it.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I didn't go through all the 25.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Okay, and then-
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   1984.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.520]   I think the first IBM ThinkPad, the big ones that they came out with initially, and then
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.520]   the later ThinkPad.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.920]   And where's the ThinkPad on here?
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.920]   There's a ThinkPad.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   Number five.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.920]   There's a ThinkPad.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.920]   700.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.920]   I got that.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   I overlooked it.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.920]   Okay, so they got-
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   I would put the morrow on there.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.920]   I wonder.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   I would put the Osborne on there.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   I would put-
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.080]   What about the regular Macintosh?
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080]   The original?
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.080]   Why is it the original?
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.560]   Why is it the first Mac, huh?
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.280]   Yeah, the 1984 machine.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   Why is not that?
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.800]   The Mac too should be on there if they're going to put this on there.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   The Lisa.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   The Lisa has to be on there.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   Everybody forgets the Lisa.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   The Xerox star.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.400]   The Xerox star should be on the Lisa, I would agree.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.720]   But again, the world, they're just cracked.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.080]   This was selected by Dartboard.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.560]   I'm almost out of the gate.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.920]   I've been to these kinds of meetings, and that's what you do.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.920]   You sit around.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   It's a Dartboard.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.720]   A bunch of guys in Dartboard is not too far from the truth.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.280]   You sit around, and a bunch of guys, whoever happens to be in the office, you throw it together
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.760]   a list, and then you try to make it a little annoying.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.440]   They've gone overboard with that.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.040]   Now, what we've seen here, by the way, I just want to point out is a little demonstration
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:55.160]   of something that was reported in the news that new research suggests that older people
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.800]   with above average intelligence tend to be disagreeable.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.040]   They're angry.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   They're angry.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.280]   The study authors noted that superior intelligence does not always go hand in hand with surliness.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.960]   Smart young people are more likely to be open.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.360]   It's only the old smart people who are cranky.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360]   Old farts.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.200]   Older and cranky may mean smarter, is the findings of the American Psychological Association
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.720]   of Paper at their 2006 convention.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.640]   Makes me sound like a nine-star.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.360]   I just wanted to credit where credits do.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.040]   Now you know why, John, is so angry because he's smart.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.200]   No, because I'm annoyed by this miserable list that is not even close to being accurate.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.160]   I'll tell you something else, annoying.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.160]   You want to stay annoyed?
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.440]   Where's the Apple III while we're at it?
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.440]   Well, no, that was not a great computer.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.840]   I'm just saying they're going to have stuff like the...
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.200]   What was that crazy one?
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.960]   The Columbia Data Products Machine.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   I mean, come on.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.360]   You want to get irate.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.920]   Look what they're doing.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.080]   Look what they're doing with the stuff they're confiscating.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.600]   Let's talk a little bit about the biggest story of the week.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.080]   Of course, the terrorists arrested in Britain.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.520]   Big terror plot to blow up planes over the US.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.720]   Planes bound from London to the United States.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.000]   They got the guys so far.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.400]   No terrorists were code red.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.920]   If you're flying from London, better not bring anything but your boarding pass and eat
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.560]   the airline meal and watch the airline movie because you can't even bring a paperback book
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.560]   on the plane.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.480]   Which I will say, people are saying, you get on the plane.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.280]   You got to watch out for those binary paperback books.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.280]   You put two of them together.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.720]   I'm trying to figure out what is it about the paperback they don't like.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.280]   Is it that you could conceal something in it?
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.720]   I mean, can't you just riffle through the pages?
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.120]   They're already going through your hair gel.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.520]   They can x-ray if there's anything in there.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.920]   Who are they kidding?
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.680]   When has this ever worked?
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.080]   What kind of, you know, Metafilter has a pretty good rundown on this with a bunch of people
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.240]   debating on what could possibly be a liquid explosive.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.000]   Well, let's make it nitroglycerin.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.640]   Yeah, well, if you're making nitroglycerin, you could walk in with a bottle of nitric acid
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.640]   to make this product.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.360]   I mean, I think you would notice it.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   You're right.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   But what if you had, this is the question, you need to have a way of separating the liquids
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.080]   into some non-volatile components.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:16.120]   One in a shampoo bottle, one in a hair gel bottle and mixing them on the plane and then
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.120]   igniting them.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.520]   Apparently, they said they planned to ignite them with the electronics from a flash, from
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   a camera flash.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.520]   But now that's nonsense.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.680]   You know, actually, if you made nitroglycerin, this is a pretty well-known fact.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.760]   If you're at people who are a camisal know this, the process of making nitroglycerin,
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.760]   if not done right, well, it'll just explode.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.560]   You don't need a detonator.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.560]   Right.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.560]   So you can make a few of these.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.200]   Remember the old cowboy movies, right?
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.760]   The nitroglycerin would be sweating off the dynamite and they could take it with their
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.520]   finger and throw it and it would explode.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.480]   Oh, that and there's been some historical accidents too through the post office.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.720]   But you'd be able to mail this stuff around.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.720]   That's a bad idea.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.720]   Here's something to get you upset.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:01.920]   Apparently, according to CBS News, Rhett Larson, a man-sized artificial, I'm reading the story,
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.680]   a man-sized artificial palm tree.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.680]   I love any story that begins with this is the best lead sentence in years.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:15.040]   A man-sized artificial palm tree and a sausage grinder have shared space in a state government
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.840]   warehouse with piles of Swiss army knives and chainsaws.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.840]   It's a few of the things travelers have had to give up at airport security checkpoints.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840]   But here's the thing that's interesting.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.680]   The state of Pennsylvania sells these things on eBay.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.080]   They're not the only ones in my understanding.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   It's such a success.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.520]   And I had something confiscated from me early on that, you know, years ago, there was a
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.800]   leatherman I just happened to have on me and I asked him, "Is there any way I could get
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.840]   this checked or if they'd taken do something with it or they could put it in a thing, I'll
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.560]   pick it up on the way back and they would stay--
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.560]   Where's the one on eBay, baby?
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.520]   They can put it in a toilet on eBay.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.840]   Or they hand you an $11 envelope to mail it to yourselves.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.520]   Sometimes you can mail it, yeah.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.600]   That's you knew because originally they didn't do any of that and they sold all that stuff.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.920]   Basically just stealing from the public.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.320]   You can put anything in your checked in baggage.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.520]   Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport gives it to the homeless.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.400]   Just what you want, a homeless guy with a chainsaw.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.120]   I thought Phoenix was giving homeless people one-way bus tickets to San Francisco.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.120]   No, first they give them the chainsaw, then they give them the one-way ticket to San Francisco.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.360]   They say, "Have fun."
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.160]   So I haven't looked on eBay, but I guess there's probably a glut of Swiss army knives now.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.160]   You probably get a pretty good deal.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.160]   I think it's a new deal.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   It's a new section on eBay.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   Illegal.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.160]   That stuff should just be destroyed.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.760]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.840]   Now why should that be destroyed?
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   It's perfectly good stuff.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.880]   Because in a sense, they give you an overpriced option or you can't get on the plane.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.560]   You either spend $11 to mail anything back to yourself if it'll fit in the envelope.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.520]   And then if that doesn't work, okay, we're going to keep it.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.040]   And then we're going to turn around and sell it.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.080]   So shouldn't they give you some sort of voucher?
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.080]   They should give me $11.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.040]   And then they can do whatever they want with it or I don't know.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.560]   Federal law gives states the rights to get banned or discarded items from the TSA contractor
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.520]   responsible for removing them.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.280]   It says it belongs to the state.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.920]   I'm going to break anything they take from me before I get it.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   That's a good idea.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.920]   That's a good idea.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.720]   500 small Swiss army knives went for a record, $595.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.120]   Even if the TSA 10 million items have been confiscated or voluntarily turned over, this
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.880]   year alone in the US, 10 million items.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.720]   This whole thing was liquids too.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   Here's my question.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.840]   Now let's talk about this, the liquid thing.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:31.400]   Because John, you say as the chemist of the bunch that there's nothing that could be
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.720]   in there that could be dangerous?
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.360]   No, I never say that at all.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.000]   You could bring in a bottle of, there's various peroxides that'll literally mix them with
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   anything and it's going to blow up.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Okay.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.360]   So it's reasonable to collect these bottles of liquids.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   Well it depends.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.520]   You're collecting crests toothpaste.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.520]   You're correct.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.640]   What are you going to open every tube and squeeze out a little bit to make this?
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.800]   No, I mean what are you supposed to do?
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.920]   You're traveling to London and you're not supposed to adopt the habit of the fish and
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.920]   have a brush or teeth.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.160]   I mean what's the deal with that?
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   Check it.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   Just check it.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.160]   I'm glad Nick's not here.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.400]   And what's to prevent somebody who's really dedicated to just carrying that stuff on their
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   physical person.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.000]   It's not going to send off any detection units currently out there.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.880]   Unless you're going through one of those sniffer machines that might pick it up if it's not
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   sealed properly.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.160]   Now Brett, you're the hair gel guy in the group.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.600]   No actually no, I take it back.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.040]   Robert, you use a pecahare gel yourself.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.600]   Yeah, I've been shaving my head pretty much.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.720]   So it's a little bit.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.800]   Okay, so forget curly, but Brett, have you been flying lately?
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:39.920]   Ironically, I flew back from San Francisco on Wednesday or the day before the big.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.080]   So you got your hair gel on board?
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:47.040]   So I not only got my hair gel on board, I got my laptop, my digital from my iPod.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   Well, so there's another.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.800]   You could still carry this stuff though in the US.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   It's only London to Britain, the US that you can't.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.080]   Well, I mean, they wanted to think about the idea of like keeping people from bringing
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.240]   laptops on the plane.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.040]   A member of Congress said it's just a matter of time before carrying all carry-ons are
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.040]   banned.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   Which is ridiculous.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   What are they supposed to do?
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.920]   You're supposed to tie the person to the seat and then shoot them up with drugs?
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.200]   I mean, how are you going to go on a flight from here to New York and not be bored out
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   of your mind?
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   Imagine what you have to sing about.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.400]   What do you have work to do?
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400]   Right.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.040]   Oh, no, business men just go crazy with this if they did that.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.280]   How much you want to bet none of the supplies to first class?
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.160]   And of course, none of the supplies to anybody who charters a flight or owns their own plane.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.440]   And don't forget the shoe bomber was in first class.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.360]   So that is not going to make a lot of sense.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.000]   I see what happens up in first class.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Even pretty much do.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I tell you to turn off your electronics.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.520]   See, that's ironic because that's what terrorists always buy first class tickets.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.520]   I mean, you know, why not fly.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.360]   That's your last flight.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.840]   Have a drink, okay?
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.600]   I've been in first enough to know that you're treated just the same.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.600]   You just get more.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   No, you're not.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.600]   Not even.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.320]   No, I always know that you turn off your stuff.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   They won't let me use their bathroom.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.320]   I know that.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   They say, no, you can't.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.680]   Well, that's there's other reasons for that, Leo.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.600]   That's because of people like me.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   Leo can't use.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.600]   It's not me specifically, John.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.600]   All right.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.600]   That'll work.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.560]   I will throw this in as a note about no carry-ons.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.720]   I know people in the airline industry who thinks that's the greatest thing in the world.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.480]   Oh, they hate it because it slows down the road.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480]   No carry-ons, check in.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.240]   You get on the plane in 10 minutes.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   Everybody's ready to go.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.240]   But don't you.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   I mean, I have to say, I agree.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.680]   Don't you hate people who bring four bags on and they're trying to jam them in.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   They always...
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.680]   People...
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.160]   They're coats in the overhead and take up all the space so I can't get my bag up there.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   That's what really irritates me.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.160]   I hate the guys.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160]   I hate the guys.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.120]   Got all the leg room and he's put all his bags up above so I can't put anything.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.480]   He's got plenty of leg room for his system.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.680]   Oh, pities, moaning, groan.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.920]   There's plenty of room all over the plane.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.200]   All right.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.160]   You flop it by somebody as a grump.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.000]   You know, I actually...
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.760]   The flights I fly for some reason are always sold out.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.000]   They're always full flights and there's never enough room.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.520]   And of course, they're all losing money somehow, right?
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.080]   Well, I fly here at Canada.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.080]   I guarantee they'll lose money.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.080]   All right.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.080]   That's a topic for another day.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.080]   Another day, another time.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.400]   Mac Pro, apples, WWDC was this week in San Francisco.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   I guess that's probably why you were out, Brett Larson.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   I know you...
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   I was at the Expo.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.040]   You care about these things.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:21.480]   Steve, no new iPod phone, no new iPod, no iTunes movie rentals.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   None of the rumors panned out.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.280]   The only thing that they did announce that was of any significance was what everybody
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.880]   expected, which is an Intel tower.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.160]   But some surprises here.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.920]   The pricing for one thing.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.560]   Yeah, very low.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.360]   It's actually lower than a comparably equipped Dell ProLiant server.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.000]   In fact, I think they have the lowest price for these Woodcrestsians on the market.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   By $999.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.520]   Unheard of for Apple to actually offer the lowest price computer.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.160]   Yeah, it won't be for long.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.360]   I think it's funny that the big news coming out of the conference is that there was no
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.120]   news and that everybody talks about it as news.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.120]   But there is no news.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   There's always a believable.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.280]   Well, I think the Mac Pro is news.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   I think the Mac Pro is news.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.480]   I mean, this is a nice computer for $2,500.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.200]   You're getting a very nice machine.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.720]   Yeah, it's a computer.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.920]   I think what Mac users, myself included, are starting to get frustrated with this Intel
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.000]   transition is the hardware looks the same.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.440]   The MacBook Pro looks like...
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.440]   This was a surprise.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   No, you're right.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   This was a surprise.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.320]   Everybody thought, well, they'll have to redesign the case for the Mac Pro because everybody
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.800]   will be confused and they didn't.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   And they did.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.000]   Everything wrong with the case design, I think it's one of the most beautiful cases made.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   The G5 was a nice looking machine, but Apple has a habit of updating their hardware every
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.200]   couple of years and they haven't with the Intel transition.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   Which, of course, it's okay.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   It's just a bit...
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.800]   It sort of proves the point that it's just a processor change and nothing else.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.320]   Or maybe that's this semi-autics.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.400]   I am happy to see the transition over.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   You know, it's over.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.760]   The transition is over.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.520]   Now all that power PC hardware is deep, deep discounts.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.680]   Now, would you buy if you could get a cheap power book or a cheap G5?
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.840]   Would you buy it?
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   I...
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.120]   No, not only I would because you're going to get two or three years out of it.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.240]   We know that Leopard will be backwards compatible with the power PC chip, but we don't know
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.840]   what 10.6 is going to be.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.480]   For all we know, they quickly killed off Classic.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.080]   Very quickly killed off OS9.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.080]   They may never...
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.080]   Never...
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.080]   Yeah, and you're right.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.400]   And how long before universal applications become Intel applications?
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.080]   Right, exactly.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.560]   And I would bet...
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.760]   I wouldn't put money on it, but I would bet by 10.6 or 10.7, we're going to start to
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.400]   hear about, you know, support for power PC chips is going away.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.320]   Because Apple has a habit of doing this.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.720]   It's going to be backwards compatible forever until next year.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   Right.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.480]   You know, and then everything stops working and they get class action loss.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.040]   You said you were angry about Apple.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.560]   Why were you angry?
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.840]   I was angry because once again, Jobs snubbed me when I tried to ask him a question.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.840]   What is it?
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.400]   Reparts of the CBS News.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.360]   I'd like to talk to you, Steve.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.400]   Yeah, I didn't ask him about the failure of the next step operating system.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.880]   That's all he's worried about, you know.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.160]   I didn't ask him about this stock thing that he's...
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.160]   So how did he snub you?
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.160]   Did he just look away?
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.760]   He ignored me and his PR flack woman like stands between him and my camera and pushes
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   me away.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.760]   Yeah, I even know Steve.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.920]   I actually hung out with him socially and ignored me, so I don't feel too bad.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.000]   I don't feel bad.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.440]   But you know, I wasn't...
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.720]   I just, you know, Apple is a victim of their own success.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.280]   People go to these things and expect everything in the world.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.360]   And it's ironic that the rumor sites, everybody in the media reads them.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.840]   And the rumor sites actually raise the bar of expectation and the reality is...
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.560]   Well, now you know why Apple tried to put these guys out of business.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.320]   These rumor sites aren't helping Apple at all.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   They're making every in-announcement look disappointing.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.280]   But I will say, you know, the stuff they showed off in Leopard was like, "Alright guys, let's
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.280]   wrap it up.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.280]   I don't care about...
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.680]   How the ruts said...
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.480]   Paul Therut said, "Now Apple should be apologizing for stealing from Windows.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.440]   The shoes on the other foot."
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.440]   You think?
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.440]   I don't know if I agree.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.440]   His price...
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.440]   I agree 100%.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.440]   Alright, why do you say that, Josh?
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   Yeah, why do you say that?
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.440]   I don't know.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   I just don't agree.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.240]   You know, Time Machine is just the Windows server.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.240]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:19.800]   There's some obscure backup technology built in the Windows 2003 server.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   He said...
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.520]   And you know, I mean, it's true Time Machine is kind of like system restore on steroids
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   or go back.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.520]   Right.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.520]   I don't know.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.520]   I think it's...
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.840]   I think actually it's pretty impressive to make an easy to use backup system that's going
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.120]   to work for users is a good idea.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.440]   Oh, you know, Leo, you know how you know it's going to work.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.440]   I've always advocated.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.440]   We don't know it's going to work.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.600]   But, you know, I think Apple's pretty good on their track record of back-
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.080]   Now, here's Mike.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.720]   My concern with Time Machine, though, was how far back is this thing going to go and
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   how much space is that going to take?
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.280]   Well, that's the same problem with go back.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.200]   I mean, go back was really a pig.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.400]   Apple actually a little bit of trouble.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.440]   One last Apple story.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.440]   The Nasdaq was going to delist them.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.600]   Yikes.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.120]   On Friday, they got a letter saying that the Apple no longer meets the exchange's listing
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   requirement.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   The reason is...
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   Not following a 10Q.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.800]   That's the reason, among other things.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.120]   This is all going back to the options scandal, John?
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.000]   Yeah, they got to restate all these.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.920]   Apparently, they got to do a ton of restatements.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.000]   And this is like, you know, not a good thing for anybody.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.120]   And it's particularly not a good thing for investors because nobody knows now what
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.120]   Apple really made.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.120]   I mean, they have to...
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:35.400]   But it doesn't affect the revenues and it's merely that they misstated or, you know, illegally...
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.800]   It affects the profits.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.320]   Because they didn't follow the...
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.000]   Affects it negatively or positively, wouldn't it?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.440]   Well, negatively, of course.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.280]   Why would there be such a, you know, a fuss over it?
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   Why is Steve so worried?
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   I guess so.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.000]   It's going to be a huge negative issue and it's going to...
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.960]   Probably, I know, maybe a buying opportunity because I still don't see...
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.120]   It's not about fundamentals at all.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   No, it's not.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.720]   And then probably Apple if they keep up with the...
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:07.080]   It does hurt the morale, but they keep up with the way they're going with their iPod,
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.240]   the initiative and everything else.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.200]   I mean, this company's still maybe the strongest PC company out there, even though there's not
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.240]   really making their money from PCs.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   So that...
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.560]   I will say this though.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.360]   And I'm going to put this question out to you guys.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:27.400]   With the announcement of that machine, of the Mac Pro being an inexpensive PC basically,
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.880]   you think that Apple is going to move in on some of the PC manufacturers because you
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.720]   can buy one of these things and run Windows on it.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.120]   I mean, that's what it looks like, doesn't it?
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.480]   They're beating Dell at its own game.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   And I...
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:45.440]   You know, when you're selling a better looking machine for $1,000 less, I mean, people have
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.320]   got to start to think, "Wow, maybe I'll buy a Mac, I'll put Windows on it, but gosh,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   everyone will use the Mac."
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   It's there.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.080]   Gee, I wonder who was advocating that this might actually happen some...
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.080]   Like maybe a year ago.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.680]   You've got a lot of you to remember reading something from you.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.960]   You've got a lot of heat saying that Apple would start selling Windows, but really this
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:08.120]   is more reasonable that they're not selling Windows, but selling Windows machines or their
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.640]   machines are, let's say they're operating system agnostic.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.040]   Just a matter of time.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   Interesting.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.880]   You know, you can buy Windows now at the 24-hour Apple store on Fifth Avenue, which happens
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.360]   to be in the courtyard of the CBS News Early Show.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.720]   I still don't understand why Apple would prefer to be a hardware company than an operating
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.720]   system company.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.080]   They've always been a hardware company.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.000]   They have a chance they have to become a software company, they refuse to do it.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Why, John?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I mean, look at the iPod.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.600]   The iPod's a hardware thing with a software.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.600]   They use software to sell hardware, and that's what the iPod's all about.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.360]   But margins and hardware are much lower.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.840]   I don't understand it.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.800]   They always had good margins because Apple made a high quality premium product, and so
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.840]   they could get an inch, and it was kind of different than everything else, so they could
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.760]   always inch out that extra bit of money.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.240]   I still think they can do it.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:57.600]   And if they're selling essentially what Dell's doing, or cheaper, because they, for whatever
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.120]   reason, maybe the design's newer.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   I mean, there's probably a lot of reasons that I'm sure that their margins are still
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.120]   pretty aggressive.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.400]   I mean, I've always said that Apple, if you have a choice between something that looks
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.600]   really cool and something that looks kind of dowdy, that people will pick the thing that
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.800]   looks pretty cool, even if they have to pay an extra 10 bucks for it, because it looks
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   pretty cool.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   Maybe more than that.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.040]   I think a lot of PC hardware is just crappy hardware.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.360]   I mean, there's a lot of junk, too.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.360]   Yes.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.280]   The iPod's no better than any other MP3 player.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.960]   It looks cooler and it's a little easier to use.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.680]   And I think Apple has paved the road for themselves.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.480]   I'll tell you what we're doing on Call for Help.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.480]   We need new machines.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.640]   We're not going to buy the, we're not going to replace the Dell's with Dell's.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.400]   We're going to buy Mac Pros, and that way we can run both Windows.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.360]   Remember, I mean, you must remember all the problems we would have switching back and
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.800]   forth between Macs and PCs on the set of Call for Help.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.960]   Well, now we're just going to have one computer.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.320]   And instead of switching computers to run a Mac or a PC, we'll just press Alt-Enter and
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.240]   switch over to parallels and show that show the Windows side of it.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   Exactly.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.920]   I mean, this is why, part of the reason why I got the MacBook Pro is because when I've
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.400]   got to go do a software demonstration or something, I can, I got both.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.360]   They're both operating systems are ready to go.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.240]   And fully functional, parallel is fully functional Windows, unless you're trying to format a
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   hard drive.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.960]   Then it crashes.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.400]   Looks like Vista may be out actually on time.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.920]   Well, on time, according to the most recent schedule, January 2007, yesterday, Microsoft
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.320]   Blogger actually a couple of days ago, implied that they were very close to release candidate
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.320]   one.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   I'm loving it.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.080]   I think it's really, we got to see it.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.920]   Now you're using beta two, Robert.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   Whatever the 40 or the 50, 55, yeah.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   55.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:51.200]   You mean the 50, they name it by 5505 because it takes 55.05 gigabytes to run it.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.920]   I've had no issues.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.640]   I love the operating system.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.840]   I think it looks silly.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.000]   I think it looks like shellac on a piece of poo-poo.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Can I sit on it?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   You can say it.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Absolutely.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   I don't know what it means, but you can say it.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.800]   It just, it looks like a glossy coating on something that's really not all like great.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   Beta one expires in May.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.680]   So you've got a little longer to use it.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   But the release can't at all.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.680]   The beta two or beta.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.680]   How do you get the one that?
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.480]   The one that beta two is the one.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.680]   Oh, another thing, which is great news is that they may unlock the, you know, you couldn't,
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.440]   you couldn't register beta two anymore.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.240]   You know, they closed down the previews.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.240]   Apparently they're going to add new users to the CTP program finally.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.560]   So if you've been, if you've had that beta two disk but haven't been able to authenticate,
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.440]   you can do that now.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.480]   So Robert, why do you like this thing?
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.640]   Let's see.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.200]   Start to finish just simply installing it compared to any other previous operating system
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.200]   from Microsoft.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.240]   It's a, it's a smoother, it's the way it should have been originally in terms of having the,
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.680]   getting, getting the little stuff out of the way first and pretty much being an unintended
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.240]   install hardware wise.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.240]   It's just nice to have all of that support on a single disk now where you really don't
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.480]   have much in the way of tracking down a driver updates and things like that.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.280]   It's all pretty damn automatic.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.360]   The protective nature of the operating system as far as I've seen anyway, it goes out of
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.160]   its way to keep you from mucking things up or from rogue applications from mucking things
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   up.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   Well, it's going to be just going to be interesting to my candy as well.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.800]   It's going to be interesting to all the great 3D features and other stuff.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.360]   You can rave over that, but I don't think we yet know how secure Vista is going to be.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.360]   Yeah, no one's attacking.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.360]   No, no, no.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.600]   Maybe they'll be knowing shortly.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   I guarantee that.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.480]   But it's also just like when I install games now, the default window when you bring up Microsoft's
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.720]   games now on Vista, it gives you a list of all the games that were preloaded.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.760]   But it also periodically scans my system and adds those icons to the list.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.120]   That being a part of scanning my system.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.880]   Well, I mean, it's like, oh, we realize you just installed another application that's
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.080]   probably a game here.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.120]   Let's make sure it's included in our content rating system for parents to say.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.520]   Well, let me ask this question.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.600]   Robert, let me ask you this question.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.160]   If somebody's an XP user and they're like, you know, let's just say they got an XP machine
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.360]   just recently and they want to.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:13.440]   I mean, is it going to be important for them to make a switch and you have to do an over
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:19.440]   install, you know, put install Vista on top of XP or can they just be different?
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.440]   Are they going to want?
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.440]   Are they going to want to do that?
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.240]   Is it going to make a big difference to their live?
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.480]   I mean, how important is Vista in that regard?
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.160]   I don't think anybody should, especially if you just purchased a computer and it comes
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.440]   with a fully functioning copy of XP.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.760]   XP is going to be supported for a couple more years.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.760]   Definitely what?
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.760]   Keep it?
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.000]   Have anyone a reason to say yes, you might.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.640]   But at the same point, if you were running an older system and you're about to buy a
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.600]   new computer, you know, it's going to be a compelling feature to have just because it's
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.040]   such a nice upgrade compared to what was out there before.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.120]   And I want it.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.040]   I want it, but you know, I'm going to wait and buy a machine when I can buy it pre-installed.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.400]   As I think of most people will, but that's the way they will experience it.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.040]   All the good news for a high-end system and you're looking for a new operating system that's
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.120]   Windows, you know, and Vista's available, it's the same darn prices XP was when it launched.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.480]   The news for Mac folks like Brett and me is that the new Parallels, which is now coming
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.400]   out in beta, will support Vista.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.400]   That's cool.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   So we will be able to run it, which is nice.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.640]   I'm also liking the new version of Media Center too.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   Really?
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.280]   So there's a new, I didn't know there was a new version.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.880]   This is Vista Media Center?
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.880]   It's part of that.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   I haven't seen it.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   It's new.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.640]   So far, for what I've seen it, the big complaint I have about Microsoft Media Center edition
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.200]   is that it requires the TV tuner side of things.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.840]   It requires an analog tuner.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:41.040]   You can't go any further as far as TV tuner use unless you have an analog tuner in there.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.240]   When I never look at analog television on my PC, it's always with digital either an
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.960]   IDEA for standard DEF.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.840]   So just getting that little thing out of the way initially is a nice upgrade right there.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.640]   The other thing being just the user interface.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.800]   I love the way the upgrades and changes there.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.560]   I think it's more logically laid out.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.600]   I think it'll be easier for someone who's never looked at it to use it.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:06.400]   It's a lot of polished, but it's also just some basic underpinnings of things that was
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.640]   like, "Okay, why wasn't it this way?"
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.160]   It began with it and I was like, "Okay.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.640]   Maybe it is pretty much just a version too, but it's definitely improved."
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.760]   Well, you're the only one that I've heard that has nothing but raves.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.920]   And I'm wondering why do you think other people are so condemnational?
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.920]   That's even a word.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.920]   I like that word.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.320]   A lot of people haven't used latest beta though.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.520]   And none of the people who were able to sign up in the public and download have had access
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.720]   to this latest version yet.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.760]   It's 55.05 is not available in different download.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.760]   And that's the thing.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.600]   I think a lot of people are dealing with some of those two initial versions that were a
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.600]   little sketchy and it was really, "Look, you're playing beta tester for Microsoft and
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.800]   don't kid yourself otherwise."
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.280]   Well, they say it too.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.840]   You're helping stabilize and get the thing ready to roll up, release candidate one.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.840]   And here it is now.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.680]   Well, it's coming up eventually, but this latest version in particular, it was just the one
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   where it's like, "You know what?
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.320]   I've been running it now for about a month."
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.640]   I got to ask them of this.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:08.160]   Because when I saw Windows Vista, I thought, and Leo and John, you probably have an opinion
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.560]   on this too, Microsoft seems to be stuck in this.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.160]   It has to look like Windows 95.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.120]   Like everything, it still all kind of looks the same.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.120]   I don't know.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.560]   I mean, I think that Toolbar, the ribbon is a very big shift in user-in.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.320]   Full start menu has been redone.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.280]   In fact, you can search the start menu.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.080]   That's a huge help.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.080]   Because that was a problem.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.120]   You get this massive start menu with 8,000 programs.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.720]   You can't find anything in there.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.720]   Exactly.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.720]   That's been cleaned up significantly.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.640]   It's really just when you click on it, when you click on it, it's not even a start button.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.200]   It's a little icon.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   Click on that little icon.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.240]   It simply shows you what are the last eight or nine things you clicked on before.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:49.640]   I'm not going to dispute the usability or the new look or anything, but I think what
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.680]   we don't know, and we won't know for a while, although they are at Black Hat Microsoft,
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.080]   try to give away copies to 2,000 of the hackers at Black Hat, is really how secure it is.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:03.520]   Yeah, it's got all these new require-yander passwords and all these new layers of security.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.160]   But I have a feeling that underneath that it may be full of holes.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.920]   For instance, Steve Gibson, we did it on security now, was talking about the fact that
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.960]   they've rewritten the network stack from scratch.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.800]   Certainly in the beta, a lot of the mistakes that were made even in Windows 95 have been
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.840]   made all over again, which is a little scary.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.160]   We've been mentored to report on this.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.120]   Now, of course, they'll get it better before it ships, but the question is, can you start
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.280]   a network stack from scratch and expect it to be reliable within a year or two?
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.360]   I do know anybody with a computer that's had their system hacked.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.400]   No, actually, that's a very good point.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   I don't.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   I mean, people talk about the...
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   I don't know any...
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.400]   No, I take it back.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.000]   I know a lot of people with zombified computers.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Oh, that's...
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And that's hacked in a way.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.640]   A lot of Windows users caused by people clicking on something or not paying attention to a
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.640]   dialogue box.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.880]   Well, what do you mean by hacked then?
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:00.640]   Well, I was talking about somebody owning your computer and abusing you, stealing your
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.640]   data or whatever.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   Well, like what Steve was talking about, that...
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.080]   There's tons of people that have had that hap to us and we know lots of them.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   Are you kidding me?
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.080]   Zombified computers.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.560]   Zombified computers, one thing, but somebody who's actually had their system penetrated
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.480]   by an outside force.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   Like, personally...
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.960]   Personally, they're router through their whatever.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.400]   And it got in and actually got some information off of somebody's computer.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.400]   Interesting story.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.520]   Well, I guarantee if we throw that out to the audience out there from...
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.680]   We have a high end audience.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.600]   There's plenty of people where that's happened.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   It's a ridiculous situation.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.760]   I'm not talking about you clicked on any XC and you had your system taken over to become
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.360]   a zombie for spamming or DOS attacks or things like that.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.120]   You mean somebody coming out of the blue and tell you, "I think that, you know, one
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.120]   time I left, oh..."
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.120]   I got in and had my bank records that I kept on my computer taking.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.120]   You know, I don't keep doing that.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   I don't keep doing that.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   Many people are personally targeted, but I do think that as a group, Windows...
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.640]   I think randomly people get hit all the time.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.920]   I mean, if you leave an old version of Qt, this happened to me.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.840]   I happened to use Qt FTP and I left it on the machine and some little worm came along
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.120]   and saw the support there and it started next day.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.080]   I know somebody's like looking at my computer from God knows where.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.720]   I just turned off the Qt FTP but I caught him doing it.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.080]   And I suppose this kind of thing goes on all the time.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.120]   So that's one of the things I'm hoping with Vista is that it really...
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.400]   Is Vista certified applications that are basically...
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.720]   I forget if that's how they're going to term...
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.800]   Is it more severe than somehow?
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.360]   But it's just okay, it's been looked over and it won't have.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   Oh, come on.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.040]   Microsoft, which is not such a good job of looking over their own applications, is now
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.960]   going to certify other people's applications.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.960]   I know.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.960]   Wasn't this something they did back when?
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   I remember some years ago when you had to go through a Microsoft approval system and
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.160]   to get on their list or white list.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.160]   It's a revenue thing for Microsoft.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.800]   They charge thousands of dollars to become certified.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.120]   But it's to say that, okay, look, you ran an application and you didn't even take the
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.200]   time to run a simple scan through your code to say, oh, yeah, by the way, we have three
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.720]   buffer overflows within your code because you're too lazy to check for.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.160]   I'd feel more saying if Microsoft had done a better job doing the same thing on its own
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.520]   code to be honest with you, I don't know if that's going to make it.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.520]   No, no doubt.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.520]   I think the really...
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.880]   And also, we all are hoping that Vista will be more secure.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.120]   We're praying it'll be more secure.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.960]   If it's not, it's trouble for everybody, not just Microsoft.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.320]   But it's going to have to talk about this too.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   It what?
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.920]   If it's good news for Symantec, rogue application.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.120]   Actually, Symantec says it's not good news for them.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.080]   There's an interesting story going around now.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.560]   Symantec and a number of other security companies are actually mad at Microsoft in the way they
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:39.040]   have implemented security because third-party security programs won't have the same kind
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.560]   of access to the system that Microsoft has itself.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.600]   They say Windows patch guard actually hinders their ability to protect Windows.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.640]   It's kind of in effect making it a Microsoft security monopoly.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.600]   Well, we've never seen Microsoft even.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.520]   Patch guard, according to Bruce McCorkendale, chief engineer at Symantec.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.440]   Patch guard is hurting security vendors more than it is hurting malware writers.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.120]   There are types of security policies and next-generation security products that can only work through
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.560]   some of the mechanisms that patch guard prohibits.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:17.040]   They're just going to have to work their way around the problem.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:21.760]   These companies are huge multi-million dollar companies that survive on the backs of poor
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:27.920]   users who are getting viruses and other problems installed in their machines.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.880]   They're just essentially, I don't want to say parasites, but they're companies that
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.600]   in some ways, if you go back to the history of the virus, you find McAfee, one of the
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.640]   guys who publicized into such an extreme, they made them popular with his, you know,
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.200]   a newsletter and all the rest of it.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.160]   I'm not a big sympathizer with the guys who make this stuff.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.320]   No, I agree with you.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   I agree with you.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.000]   In fact, if Microsoft can say, "Well, we're going to establish these policies that keep
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.800]   everybody but, you know, certified Microsoft drivers out of the...
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.120]   Well, I don't like that either, but, you know, at the same time.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.000]   These guys, these guys are creative and get around it.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.200]   I'm not going to, you know, shed a tear for Symantec.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.760]   If Microsoft said, let's say, for instance, we're going to make sure that you can't do
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.120]   a root kit on Windows, nobody's going to, nobody's going to be upset.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.560]   And if a security company says, "Well, but we need that capability," I don't know if
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.000]   anybody would be upset by that.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.920]   Microsoft has said this is good news for PC manufacturers.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:27.840]   Actually, Microsoft hasn't said this, but a Taiwanese OEM has leaked this that Microsoft
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:33.000]   starting in October will offer VISTA upgrade coupons to people who buy new PCs.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.800]   So, that means if you've been waiting to buy a new PC, you don't have to wait till January.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   Yeah, that was predictable.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   They have to do that.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.800]   They always do that, right?
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   Yeah, they always do.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.840]   I don't want to come off sounding like I'm just sitting here promoting Microsoft to
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.840]   no one else.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:54.000]   I figured, if you don't have a valid reason, if you don't specifically need the Windows
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.160]   operating system to run a certain program that you depend on, do yourself a favor and
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.640]   check out some of the alternatives too.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.640]   I mean, Linux distribution is at this point.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.280]   They're just as easy, if not even easier to install, and it provides a full graphic
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   user interface.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.280]   I would have went to my old Mac's.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   And a solid experience.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.920]   I put my MacBook, the 15-inch MacBook, and it's PowerBook.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.920]   It's great.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.920]   It was so easy.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   It was instantaneous.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.920]   No problems.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:16.920]   All the drivers worked.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.880]   IBM recently announced that they're installing Suce Enterprise Edition now and offering out
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.760]   on their notebooks, and that's always had good notebook support as far as the phone's
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   the thingbooks.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   It's the thingbooks.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.760]   Right.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.760]   I think that's the thing.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   No, yeah, I get to start IBM anymore.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.960]   It says somebody pointed out, is he's the communist.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.880]   Somebody actually put this comment in one of our tests, probably on Twitter, saying it's
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.600]   the Chinese communist government that owns Lenovo.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.320]   I haven't heard anybody call it the Chinese communist.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.760]   Guys, this is the people who have never been to China apparently.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.760]   It's the red.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.280]   It's the red.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.200]   Microsoft did have a bad year in security.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:59.160]   In fact, according to information we put out as many critical alerts so far in 2006 as
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.880]   they had in 2004 and 2005 combined.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.040]   Maybe that's not a bad thing.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.840]   Maybe that means they're being very aggressive in patching their software.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.000]   51 security bulletins, 98 patches, 64 of them critical.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Wow.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   That's good.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.600]   Yeah, you know, in a way, I don't think that's necessarily a negative is it?
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.680]   It means they're fixing it.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:24.640]   The most popular software out there on personal computers should be fixed a lot.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.640]   Should be fixed on a regular.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.560]   If it's broken, it needs to be fixed.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.080]   Everything's broken and it all needs to be fixed.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:35.280]   In a way, I think this is more saying Microsoft's been more aggressive about patching than in
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   the past.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.680]   Well, these are not charging us money every time they come up with a patch on Tuesday.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.880]   That could happen.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.760]   They're waiting for a network worm attack on Windows.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   Security experts say it appears inevitable.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.160]   Microsoft issued the patch bulletin on Tuesday.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:55.960]   It was patched Tuesday for a server service flaw that was critical.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.000]   And apparently they expect the exploits have already started circulating.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   They expected attack.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.320]   I don't know what they do to any minute now.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.880]   They're waiting against a fire.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.040]   A researcher at a minute, he said, "These exploits are capable of launching attacks
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:16.320]   against firewall protected Windows XP service pack to a worm is coming.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.760]   The bug is just too easy to exploit."
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.520]   We haven't seen a bad worms in Zotob.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.560]   No, you know, there's a thing that's happened.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.280]   It's kind of interesting and it's a sociology that's not really been discussed too much,
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:31.240]   which is that most of the guys who write that kind of stuff have all switched over to writing
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.240]   spyware.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:39.640]   There's actual money to be made writing spyware and it's the same kind of mentality.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.360]   Well, and you could tell because spyware has gotten really good at hanging on.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.320]   It's hard to get rid of.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.560]   Really hard to get rid of.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.560]   Right.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.160]   And you can have five different scanners.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:53.000]   And if you run all of them, you'll find that you get five different results.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.880]   And I don't think there's a scanner out there that will clean or any combination of scanners
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.880]   out there that will clean of all spyware.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.880]   I think most of the time if you get spyware, you're looking at a reinstall.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.640]   Well, if you get the really bad versions, yes.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.840]   You can get rid of most of it if you use enough scanners.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.840]   But you know, that's where virtualization starts looking really good.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   No kidding.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.160]   We're doing a whole series on security now of virtualization because VMware is there's
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.600]   a free version of its free virtual PC.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   It does look good.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.640]   You know, it's also good for the the black hats to in terms of creating environments
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.960]   where you can make undetectable very bad things.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:27.960]   Right.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.520]   Don't leak out into your system.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   Right.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.760]   Hey, to be completely fair, Apple has released a security patch for its new Mac Pro.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   Yes.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   It came out.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.240]   It came out Monday on Wednesday.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   They issued a fix.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.520]   I guess apparently it did.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.920]   There were five patches, including a security update that they didn't have time to put
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.400]   on the computer as they shipped it.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   No.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.040]   If you have a Mac Pro, make sure you're running software update on your Macintosh.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.600]   Does it happen automatically by default when you own stuff?
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   Yeah, it does.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   Nice.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.080]   It runs once a week on its own.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.080]   Yeah, by default.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.840]   And it'll just say, so you know what's interesting?
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.640]   I don't know if it's just me, Brett, but I don't run as administrator on a Macintosh.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.080]   I don't think anybody should run an administrator on any OS if you can avoid it.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.600]   But I noticed that the updates don't seem to run automatically unless you're administrator.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.960]   As soon as I log in as the administrator, I boom, it says you got updates.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.720]   So now you set up yourself an account that isn't admin accessible?
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.720]   And that's what I use day in day out.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.720]   Oh, you should too.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.720]   I always give myself.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.520]   Oh, you know, I'm not a subscriber to this notion either.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.040]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, John.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.040]   I'll tell you why.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.320]   Well, in Windows, unfortunately, but you should do it in any sensible operating system.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.320]   You can do it.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.720]   Well, I'm just saying.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.480]   If you do it in Windows, you can do it.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.040]   I mean, you can set up a, you know, pain to do it in Windows though.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.240]   Well, yeah, but it works.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.240]   But right.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.240]   That's the problem.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.240]   That's in work.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.800]   Back or Linux, it's set up to do that.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:53.560]   And the problem is on Windows, most applications expect to be root.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.200]   That's how they were in Windows 95.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.480]   That's how we did it in Windows 98.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.240]   That's how we did it in the DOS days, my friend.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.000]   I'm in charge of this computer.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.120]   And that's one of the changes in Vista.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.240]   As it should be, there's games you cannot run without being administrator.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   That's ridiculous.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   There's no reason you have to be an administrator to run a game.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.360]   But now Leo, do you have problems when you install stuff or do you just type in the
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.360]   password of the administrator?
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.360]   It asks for the password.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.360]   And that's it.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:23.160]   It's, you know, I would highly encourage everybody, you know, you know, nobody in Linux runs
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.160]   as root.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.600]   Oh, I never run as root.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.680]   I just run as the owner of the machine.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   I have to set up.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.760]   And then on the, there is a distinction between root and administrator on Mac, but it's not
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.760]   a strong distinction.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.600]   I, yeah, I wouldn't run as administrator day to day.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.560]   And I don't, and you don't need to.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.360]   There are, there are, there are very few things you can't do as long as you're willing
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.360]   to give, you know, authenticate.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.360]   You just have to authenticate.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.960]   And that's how, that's how VIST is going to do it.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.160]   Yeah, you often have to do it anyway.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   So it's not such a big deal.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.200]   It's little things like the system preference pains locked.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.360]   You know, you have to enter in a password first.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.360]   That's all.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.360]   Oh, that's not a big deal.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   No, highly recommended.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   And I disagree with John.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:03.840]   I think the, the reason is that the spyware virus is another process is run with the security
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.000]   level you're running with.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.240]   And if you're running as administrator, you're given free rein.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.640]   In fact, there was, we may remember a few months ago, a Macintosh virus.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:15.360]   It was never really got out in the wild, but it was a, it was a proof of concept and,
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.200]   and it, it required you to run as administrator.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.520]   If you weren't running as administrator, you wouldn't.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:23.520]   I'm only referring to the windows users where it's, well, I agree.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.880]   You probably inconvenient and almost a waste of time to run anything but administrative.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.240]   No, no, and I agree with you.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.440]   And I think that's a flaw.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.360]   That's, that's one of the things that the VISTA will fix.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.480]   I know that's one of the things they're really tweaking to, because that's my other fear
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:42.280]   of VISTA is that by default, especially with the early, the two early versions that were
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.120]   released to the public that you could check out, there were a lot of pop-ups for any,
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:50.480]   any time an application that you were installing required root access or that, that low, low
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.480]   access.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.480]   But what was the pain?
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.400]   You had to click 18 times to do anything.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.800]   And there's still a couple of pop-ups, but I'm just worried that people will stop paying
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   attention to those.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   Well, that's right.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   Because for that, yeah.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.360]   Because then if that happens, then there's really, it won't be any different than the
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.360]   current situation.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.360]   Right.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.200]   There's a bunch of warnings, but you know what?
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.000]   We, hey, assume you're just not paying attention to anything at this point.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   You get warned now.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.840]   I mean, people just, you know, whenever they go to a website, just go, okay, okay, okay.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.840]   Okay.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:17.840]   Okay.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:18.840]   That's it.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.840]   I've seen the opposite of that where people freak out.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.840]   Well, that's true.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:21.840]   Oh my God.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.880]   I keep going to this site and the kid, this thing keeps popping up.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.440]   And they don't even bother reading it because it's just...
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.840]   Yeah, but those are people that are incompetent.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.520]   None of them listening to this place there.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.520]   Right.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.680]   And then very few of them listen to it.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   I'm sure.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:37.800]   What I'm wondering about with Apple is damn iTunes and QuickTime now being bundled and
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.120]   just taking over your system.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.120]   Absolutely.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.760]   Even when you uncheck everything to say, oh, don't look over these situations.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.160]   Oh, I agree.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.160]   I agree.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   It's a Paul.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.160]   It is a nightmare.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.160]   Quick time is not right good Windows software.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.520]   No, but Apple does not write good Windows software.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.520]   That's very clear.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.520]   I'll give you that.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.520]   Time to turn it off.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.520]   They need to work on that.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.640]   Actually, you know, that's the Macintosh community at fault there because over the years
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.080]   I've noticed that, you know, you have people who get used to coding for the Mac and then
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.000]   they decide they're going to do something.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Always a mistake.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.240]   And you always see that they got these ideas.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:12.160]   And the same thing happens with Linux coders or not Linux, but the Unix guys.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.160]   They stick to your OS.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.760]   They start doing stuff for Windows.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.480]   And a good example that is open office.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.480]   And if you look at the way the menus are structured and open office, the people say,
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.840]   well, you know, you always use open office instead of Microsoft office.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.840]   They say, no, you can't.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.440]   It's like, it's some of the stuff in there is just like crazy.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.800]   Or the GIMP instead of Photoshop.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   Unusable.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   Although I've never used the GIMP.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   So I can't.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.000]   You can actually redo the people of created layouts that are identical to Photoshop.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   And the camera went on top.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   GIMP shop.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.920]   Yeah, it's a old tech TV guy, right?
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.920]   It was.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.920]   What's his name?
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.920]   I can't remember his name.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   The GIMP shop.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.920]   Scott.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.920]   Oh, it was a Scott Tom.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.920]   Michelle.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   Michelle.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.920]   All right.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.920]   So they've substituted the menu.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   So it's like a clone of Photoshop.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.320]   The funny thing is that Scott is not a programmer, but you don't have to be a programmer
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.800]   to change the user interface on the game.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.800]   I don't think I come.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.160]   I don't know if it's still there or not.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.160]   GIMP shop.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.160]   It's great.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.560]   I'm going to one up Robert's complaint on the iTunes.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.000]   I'm going to throw in a complaint about their DRM.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.040]   Oh, well, we all get it.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.040]   Anybody.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.040]   No.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.200]   The squeeze box doesn't work.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.680]   That cool other thing.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.720]   What's that's I guess that's a story for another guy.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.480]   I told a Windows system.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.480]   The other.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   Robert, you're cutting it out.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.160]   You've got look at a dot MOV fuzz and I said, don't don't.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.320]   Yeah, you've got something running in the background that's tying up your machine.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   Yeah, Robert.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:38.360]   We're burning CDs while you're trying to talk to us.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:43.200]   There's a telltale sound on Skype when somebody's either got a bit torrent running in the background
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.560]   or all of a sudden starts indexing their hard drive.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.480]   No, fuck that.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:52.840]   Well, Robert, shut down his background processes.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.440]   I'll bring up another story.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.440]   Nothing.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.440]   I'm looking.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.960]   Well, I get some background.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.880]   It's probably one of those Vista boxes just doing weird stuff.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:07.000]   No, Vista, if anything, it doesn't do any of that background stuff.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.200]   It doesn't do it nearly as frequently I find.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.360]   And I'm running XP right now.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.200]   Are you are you in wireless?
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.000]   Yeah, that sometimes happens to the neighbors.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.680]   The neighbors bother in you.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.680]   Neighbors.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.680]   Damn neighbors.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.120]   Always plug in if you can.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.800]   AOL last weekend.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:31.040]   I'm over the AOL call them over zealous AOL employees released a database of searches from
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:38.200]   AOL, 657,000 people, three months worth of their AOL searches.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.800]   They thought, oh, we're protecting privacy.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.080]   We'll just assign a number to each search.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.800]   What they didn't do is randomize the searches.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:48.000]   You could see any given numbers, complete search set.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:55.320]   And it took a New York Times reporter all of today's to track down 62 year old, Thelma
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.920]   Arnold of Lilburn, Georgia.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:01.000]   See, it turns out that if you look at people's searches, it tells you a lot about who they
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   are.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.400]   She's all of vanity searches.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.160]   Well, yeah, that would be one way.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.520]   Certainly if you looked at my search results, you'd see a lot of who is Leo LaPorte and
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.520]   why?
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.600]   Yeah, no, in fact, I expect most of your searches to be better.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.480]   She was searching for landscapers in her small hometown.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:22.080]   She was searching for homes sold in her subdivision.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.320]   It didn't take very long for the reporter to find her.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.720]   And he said, Ms. Arnold, you see these?
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.800]   Are these your searches?
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.000]   She said, oh, yeah, those are my searches.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.960]   Hey, I mean, talk about talk about a privacy issue.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.440]   Now, AOL pulled the database off, but of course, there are copies.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.800]   What were they trying to prove by doing this?
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:44.520]   AOL said they were just these overzealous staffers were just trying to help researchers.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.880]   You know, here's a big bunch of searches.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.880]   Maybe this will help you in your--
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:49.520]   Help researchers do what?
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.520]   I don't know.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.160]   Figure out what people are searching for.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.160]   I don't know.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.160]   Is it to fight terrorism?
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.160]   That's what-- that's usually the excuse for a bad idea.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.160]   It's a bad idea.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:00.880]   It's a bad idea, but I think it really underscores the fact that people like Google, and now
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.920]   you know why Google doesn't want to release this information.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.280]   It doesn't take much.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.720]   Three months of searches and you can figure out who you are.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.760]   If you don't mix it all up, mush it all up in a big ball.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:18.720]   So she was search person number 4417749.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.600]   Now it's been funny because I've been reading the blogs.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.640]   Other people have looked at the search results and some of the people.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.800]   Sometimes you really don't want your search results to go public.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.080]   Let's put it that way.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:33.600]   Especially those late night Google searches.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.960]   Number-- number-- exactly.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:41.280]   Number 7268042 searched for, quote, "fear that spouse contemplating cheating."
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:48.480]   Another person searched for, "How to kill oneself by natural gas."
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.000]   Well, you got to get the right information.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.400]   You don't want to screw that up.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.960]   Yeah, you don't want to screw it up.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   You know, kind of--
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.800]   Now, of course, these are people who are pretty unsophisticated because they're using
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.160]   AOL to do their searching.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:06.760]   But I don't know if this-- if your Google searches got out, that would be pretty scary.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:12.800]   Well, your Google searches are only associated with IP addresses and, you know, and you can
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.800]   also--
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:14.800]   Well, but this point--
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.800]   You can spoof those.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:16.800]   You can spoof those.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.800]   You can't do that with AOL.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.800]   What this points out is that-- yeah, that's right.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:23.640]   And maybe that's the thing to do is people should start using anonymizers and spoofing
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.920]   because-- and maybe mixing things up.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   Google said-- by the way, Google's said-- Eric Schmidt said, "This could--"
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.600]   Does he have a German accent?
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   I'm going to pretend he does.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   Nobody should.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.600]   I like--
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:34.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.160]   It never happened at Google.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:41.080]   Our number one priority is to trust our users having us.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.080]   The answer is it won't happen.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:46.080]   It's like Wolfgang Puck.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.240]   Yeah, I'm a pizza.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.120]   Because they're good for you.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:54.720]   I would put garlic and artichoke hearts on a little bit of licreish.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.720]   So--
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:57.720]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.720]   Or voices.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.760]   It is-- it is really-- that's what you say.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:05.240]   A lot of people say no more voices.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:09.640]   I just really think it's a very interesting effect that we now--
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:14.200]   in fact, I'm glad they did this because we now know really if you think about it.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:19.480]   If somebody could look at all your searches, they'd know who you were immediately.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.480]   Immediately.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:24.160]   And you can download this database if you'd like to have similar fun.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.680]   What was the security option you have?
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:29.240]   Leave your wireless access point wide open for the deniability of settings.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.400]   Oh, there you go.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.400]   Using your--
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.400]   There you go.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.400]   That is a good idea.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.800]   There have been a ton of great blog postings with people.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.880]   I keep seeing that's how somebody got out of an RA lawsuit.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:44.160]   I can't read a lot of these on the air, but emo glasses has.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.440]   The AOL search database is a comedy gold mine.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.440]   It really is.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.440]   It's kind of fun to go.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.280]   So is that-- does somebody mirror that?
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.280]   Is it available somewhere?
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.280]   Go ahead and download it.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.280]   Go over there.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.280]   Look.
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.400]   AOL search database about the third one down, a big zip file.
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:04.680]   See, I still wish Google would supply the real time unedited what people are actually typing.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.680]   You know, they do.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.560]   Well, it may be a little edited, but they don't do it publicly, but if you go to the
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.000]   Google lobby, there's a wonderful application that just shows in real time people are searching
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.840]   for, and it's fascinating.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.840]   The funny thing is people search for things like Yahoo on Google.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.440]   Didn't-- that's pretty funny.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:25.960]   Didn't they excite or one of the older now defunct kind of search sites do that just routinely
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   years ago?
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960]   Who was it?
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960]   I think it was excited.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960]   I think it was excited.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.400]   It was a hot bot that used to do it, I think.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400]   It was fun.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.440]   You could just sit there and watch, but Google does not-- they told me that, well, no, we
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   don't do this publicly.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.920]   Hey, so by the way, this is an interesting story.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.080]   So we're talking about these search engines.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:48.160]   I was looking at some blog stats on various blogs, including my own devorect.org/blog,
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:53.200]   but there's a-- I'm always tracking the bot set come by because there's a bunch of search
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   bots out there.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.560]   And it's a-- I think it's a slush or something like that.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560]   Oh, that's fantastic.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.040]   It's a Yahoo!
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.040]   New Yahoo!
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.040]   Bot.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.440]   And it is slamming some sites, like maybe 10 times as much.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:13.880]   Google's always been the-- it's always about five to one Google versus Yahoo versus MSN,
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.760]   with Google being the number one bot indexing.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.960]   And then you have Yahoo! after them.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.080]   And then sometimes MSN is maybe the same.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:26.360]   Now there's this Yahoo! new Yahoo! bot out there, which is really pounding the net.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.160]   It's going to be interesting to see if that changes anything in the scheme of things over
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.320]   the next year, because it takes a while to get up to--
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.440]   If you were going to try to start a search engine to compete with Google, you would be
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.280]   slamming hard for a long time trying to catch up with Google, right?
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.640]   I mean, you've got a lot of downloading to do.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.640]   Right.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.280]   You've got a lot of downloading to do.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.440]   Something is up.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.440]   Something's going on.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.840]   I'm going to look at my stats, because now I'm curious.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.680]   Who's looking at me?
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.680]   You look at the robots?
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.880]   Yeah, under the bots.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.280]   The various stat programs have different ways of doing it.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   Browsers and robots.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.280]   Bites?
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   Let's do it by bites.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.880]   That's always fun.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.880]   Just checking.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.120]   Who's the most efficient?
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.320]   Life Lipharia is a big one.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:21.840]   Okay, half a gigabyte goes to Mozilla compatible agent, which is obviously a pseudonym for something.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.200]   No, that's your Yahoo Slurp.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.360]   Is that what it's slurp?
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]   That's it.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360]   Slurp's the bot.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360]   Yahoo Slurp.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.520]   Okay, number one is 190 megabytes from Yahoo Slurp.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.080]   And then this is just, by the way, the time period is just, I think, a week.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.080]   It's a very short time period.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.080]   Let me do it for you.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.840]   Yeah, this is unreported, by the way, for anyone out here.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.840]   192 Megs.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.000]   It pulled off of your own site.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.600]   No, let me give you the results from the month of July.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.600]   Or megabits.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.920]   1.97 gigabytes.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.760]   But it's not just one, because that's the first slurp.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.520]   Then another 157 megabytes.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.560]   Oh, there's a ton of it.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.560]   You're right.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.600]   This is the number one search agent right now.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.120]   Is that the size of the index data that it looked at?
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.080]   Or is that how much data it downloaded from my site?
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.560]   How much data it downloaded from my site?
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.560]   Yeah, it's live.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.560]   It's redundant data.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.560]   It'll be a lot of redundant data.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.760]   Yeah, because Twitch's not a big site.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.760]   Right.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   There's all this data going.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.880]   If that's a good question, we don't know.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.000]   But I'm telling you, there's something going on right now with this new bot.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.480]   It's really interesting.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   Really interesting.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.560]   Wow, ask Cheeses.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.760]   I did tell a Google guy about it, so they're on it too, so we're going to find out eventually.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   Slurps going on.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   There's stop slurping me.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.760]   Stop slurping me.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.400]   In fact, if they are pounding your sites, people out there are running these sites.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.160]   There's ways of telling the bot not to hit you so much.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.240]   You have to find out.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.600]   Usually you can find out from a yah.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.600]   There'd be a yah who page someplace that will tell you.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.600]   You can block them.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.920]   Yeah, you can block it if you want it, but I don't think you really want to do that because
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.560]   you want to get indexed.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.640]   Yeah, you can use the robots.txt.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.240]   And if it's a well-behaved robot, I've got, for some reason, PlayStation Portable, I've
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   got 201 megabytes.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.960]   Well, I guess that's just a, it wasn't a robot.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.800]   That's a mistake, probably.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.920]   That's but yah who slurp.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.920]   And then yah who slurp China.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.880]   Yeah, that's kind of interesting, isn't it?
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.840]   There is a URL we can go to.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.040]   So we check it out?
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.040]   Well.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.600]   It's yah who.com/slurch/slurp.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.600]   Try help.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   Help?
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   Help?
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   Let me, let me, let me, let me.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:23.200]   It's help.yah who.com/help/us/wysurch/slurp.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.960]   It's a FAQ number one.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.920]   Why are you crawling my site?
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.920]   YAHOO.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.560]   YAHOO slurp is yahoo's web indexing robot.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.480]   It's just part of the yahoo search engine it says.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.080]   Well, I'm telling you, it's, I mean, it may be true that it's the same old one, but the
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.440]   sure issue is a lot more active than it used to be, I'd say, three months ago.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.040]   Well, and I watched these bots.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040]   Oh, no, you're right.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   I agree with you.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040]   I've never seen this one before.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.880]   I mean, I've seen it, but never this high on the list.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.880]   It's too much.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.240]   They need to put more elements out there.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.240]   I'm not sure what's going on.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.600]   The good thing is if you do go to this page, and I'll put a link in the show notes to this
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:59.560]   page, you can, it has very specific instructions for using robots.txt to slow it down or to
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.720]   prevent it or to change things around.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:08.720]   Yeah, I was looking at the, of all things I ran into the Boing Boing stat page, which
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.720]   they have published.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.360]   And it was hitting Boing Boing so hard that I mean, they're going to have to put something
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.320]   in their, in that robot.txt because I mean, it was, it was ridiculous.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.320]   Right.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:28.680]   Well, Apple's servers have downloaded, let's see, Apple syndication has downloaded one
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.680]   gigabyte.
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.680]   That's not all of that's pretty minor.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.680]   Not too bad.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.680]   I'll take it.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.080]   I'll take it like a man.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.840]   So other stories in the news are, I mean, this is an interesting news week.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.240]   Certainly a week to be irate and upset.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.800]   Let me see if I can find some happy news.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.800]   Happy news.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.800]   Happy news.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.960]   GoDaddy's canceling its IPO.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   No.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.840]   802.11 and delayed till January.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.680]   That's not really delayed.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.200]   I thought it was not supposed to be coming out until 2007 anyway.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.400]   It was not the standard.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.400]   So here's the issue.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.400]   It's draft right now, right?
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:12.000]   And I know air goes been complaining because there's interference issues with the current
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   standard.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.200]   Significant interference with legacy 802.11 gear.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.680]   So they're going to delay it until they can solve these problems.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.840]   So it looks like the ratification.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.040]   I'm not sure that this story is accurate.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040]   You don't think so?
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:29.680]   No, because my understanding, I was given the timeline for this whole procedure and it
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.800]   was always going to happen in 2007.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.840]   So now this is delayed till 2007 doesn't make any sense because especially January is not
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.360]   much of a delay.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.640]   Network world, John Cox, US online, a second draft of the proposed IEEE standard for the
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:48.200]   802.11 being pushed back several months with a vote on it likely January instead of late
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.760]   fall.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:57.400]   The IEEE task group is being swamped with thousands of draft comments, 12,000 plus
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.440]   comments filed to draft 1.0.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.480]   I think a lot of them having to do with these interference issues.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.400]   I know Ergo, who makes the chipset.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.080]   In fact, the one you like, right, John?
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:09.560]   Yeah, but they make the pre-end chipset.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.760]   These draft and chipsets are mostly done by the other guys.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:18.440]   I mean, Ergo has never really put out a draft because they never thought it was a good...
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:22.360]   I mean, it wasn't what they were trying to accomplish and these other guys all jumped
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.520]   the gun in the cycle, but they're all kind of want to be my mo.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.800]   This is Ergo going after some of these other guys.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.880]   The initial crop of products, according to Ergo's senior director of business development,
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.360]   had bad neighbor characteristics in early tests.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:43.200]   But then arch-rival Broadcom says, "There's not one issue that Ergo cites that can't
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.000]   be resolved were anything but stalled."
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   So yeah, you're right.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.040]   It's a fight between these guys.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.040]   It's bickering.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.040]   Bickering.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.280]   When's that ever happened in the IEEE process?
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.640]   That's never happened before.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.200]   But I think they'll get this resolved.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:02.480]   By mid 2007, we'll all be running it like a couple hundred megabits, no problem.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.480]   You're still using it?
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.120]   I used a Belkin.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.160]   Yeah, and I also have a new one from Netgear, which uses an Ergo chip that's pretty bad.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.000]   No, I got the Netgear one, the range max.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.040]   Yeah, but here's the problem with it.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:21.760]   I have three boxes from Netgear, all say range max, and all three of them are like...
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:22.840]   They're all...
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.800]   It's so confusing.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.120]   The range max, unless it's got the little Ergo label on there somewhere, which they do
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.600]   on the one that just says G-MIMO, that's the one that's the best of the group.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.440]   But the one that says draft and is probably the one that has the interference problems,
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.240]   but it's not an Ergo chip in there.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.240]   It's like very confusing.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.440]   The problem I was having with it is when you're on the wireless, certain websites don't
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   load.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.880]   If you plug into it directly over ethernet, everything works fine, which makes absolutely
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   no sense to me.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880]   That makes no sense at all.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:59.360]   Yeah, I even went to their customer service and said, "Google won't load on the Wi-Fi.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.120]   United.com won't load on Wi-Fi."
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.120]   Now these things happen.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.600]   You're probably running the Norton Internet security or something like that.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   I mean, who knows?
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.600]   It's quick.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.720]   Oh, well then there's no excuse at all.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.720]   And I have it downgraded.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.720]   I set it down to the BG compatible.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720]   Maybe that's the problem.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.880]   I know a lot of people using these very, very happy with them.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880]   No.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.200]   Well, the cheap way to do personal security too is to go with the 200 megabit standard
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.800]   that's not official anywhere and just nobody can use.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.400]   Nobody's going to hack it because nobody's using it.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   Nobody ever heard of it.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.360]   But it'll be resolved by sometime next year.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:37.800]   And I think then we'll see products from everybody that are all interoperable.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.160]   I mean, that's the problem you find with YMAX.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.520]   People say, "Well, what about YMAX?"
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:46.960]   If you really talk to the people that are making these YMAX products, they're not interoperable.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.840]   The Proxim product won't work with the Intel product won't work with this product won't
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.840]   work with the Nen of them.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.480]   I mean, they have a spec but nobody, there's no interoperability at all.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.160]   So you have to go with one brand throughout the thing.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:04.600]   I think we have a winner because Sprint Nextel just announced a $3 billion plan to use YMAX
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:10.000]   throughout the United States in 83 markets of the top 100 and using the Intel chips.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.480]   Well, we'll see.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.640]   I mean, as far as I can tell, that's not the best chip set out there.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.320]   The Proxim, I thought, would be the way to go with that.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.640]   You put $3 billion into this and you kind of...
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.640]   Yeah, it should make a difference.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.640]   It should make a difference.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.800]   But then again, you don't know for sure.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:30.400]   That's an interesting move, by the way, from Sprint to kind of try to be the fourth-generation
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.400]   network of choice.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.360]   Yeah, but you got to remember that Sprint was the one that had their...
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360]   Which I still have a dish out in front of my...
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.360]   On top of my house.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.360]   Oh, yeah, the Sprint Broadband.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.240]   For Sprint Broadband Connect, they had this point-to-point system.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.640]   And then they killed it about five years ago because they were going to go to this...
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:53.400]   You don't need point-to-point, massive, gridded kind of connectivity wirelessly.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.160]   And they had all these promises and there was demos of this and that and the other thing.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.480]   And then none of it worked.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480]   And then they...
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:03.920]   Me will cancel the other product and then you said they grandfathered it out.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.400]   And so you could keep an account if you had one.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   And then meanwhile, five...
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.520]   It's something like three or four years have gone by with nothing.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.040]   And now they've signed this other deal.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.440]   This could be money down the drain for all we know.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440]   Interesting.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.880]   I mean, on the other hand, if it works, they will not only be in a position to have a fourth
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.480]   generation cell data network, but because it's YMAX, they could have a business as a
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.240]   wireless ISP as well.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.480]   I mean, you're already seeing Lenovo putting in the...
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.000]   It would be great if they...
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.800]   If they get it to work, it would probably be sold as fixed wireless.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:34.800]   It probably would not be...
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.360]   Yeah, and so you'd have a little antenna or something on your roof.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:43.360]   You're seeing both Verizon and Singular W-WAN stuff in laptops now.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.800]   So it says, "Well, do we do Wi-Fi?
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.440]   But if you're a Verizon Ev-Doh customer, you'll also be able to do that."
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.040]   Yeah, we'll see.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.920]   Our cable modem went out a couple of weeks ago.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.440]   And I brought home that Kio-Sara EVDO Wi-Fi router.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.720]   Pretty amazing, huh?
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.720]   It's amazing.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.080]   I use it with the Sprint card.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.080]   We had the Vonage voiceover IP phone going, high-speed internet the whole.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.360]   It was as though the cable modem was still there.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.320]   Now the sad thing is...
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.400]   One of the points of YMAX was to get unwired rural areas on high-speed internet, but of
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.800]   course they're going to roll it out in metros.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.800]   That's where they're going to do it.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:18.800]   Yep.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.800]   They go where the money is.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:20.800]   I always get to New York last though.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.800]   Really?
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.800]   We're always one at it.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.800]   Not for wireless.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.800]   You won't be for wireless, I don't think.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.800]   It's a right-of-way issue.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.280]   No, the city parks are going to get Wi-Fi here in New York.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.600]   Free Wi-Fi.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.560]   By the way, it's not IE7+ anymore.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.920]   It's just IE7.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.800]   That's word brought to you by Microsoft.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.800]   Nokey buys loud-eye.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.800]   Not loud-eye.
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.680]   It's a digital music vendor.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.160]   So loud-eye is a digital music vendor.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:54.160]   For $60 million, nokey becomes a digital music vendor, which is kind of an interesting
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   move.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   Although it makes sense.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160]   I mean, if you make handsets.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.640]   Yeah, you put it in the handsets.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.640]   Like that Verizon service that I've not fawned of.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.280]   Have you played with that?
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.600]   And they got mad at me for this, but I think $2 a song is too much.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.160]   But you get to download it twice.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.080]   Yeah, but it's like $2.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.080]   They should shoot people.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.720]   I don't have to pay $2 a song.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:16.600]   I can put it on my computer and on my iPod.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.320]   $25 cents should be the price.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.320]   I agree.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.320]   I agree with John.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.520]   I agree with you all.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.320]   I think unless it's a hit, it shouldn't cost a dollar.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.840]   Hey, speaking of hits, I'm very excited.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.680]   Duran Duran is going to start performing in Second Life.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:34.680]   Yay.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:40.680]   You know, Second Life is at Online 3D World.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:46.080]   British band Duran Duran are creating a virtual island in which they'll perform actual live
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.040]   concerts in this 3D world.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040]   Are they still a group?
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:57.960]   No, you don't have to be a virtual Duran Duran keyboardist Nick Rhodes told BBC News.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:03.520]   When I first discovered Second Life a few months ago, I was astounded by the possibilities.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.520]   When I set the film, that's actually more like Crocodile than me.
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.760]   It's terrible, terrible.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.760]   But I'm amused.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.040]   You do concerts in your underwear.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.280]   That's the best part.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.280]   You know, when they say live concerts, yeah, exactly.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.760]   You're not going to see them.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.600]   You're going to see the guitar.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.320]   And how are they going to make music?
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.600]   Are they going to play tapes and lip sync?
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.600]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.600]   It's terrific.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.600]   You don't even have to do that.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.120]   You could just run a stat right into the system and have it do the lip syncing for you.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.360]   They actually don't even have to show up.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.320]   You know, if you really think about it, there's some more potential here.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.280]   We can see a Jimi Hendrix reunion tour.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.800]   Now you're talking.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.720]   Keith Moon could join the who again?
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.440]   The doors back together again?
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.440]   I think this is right.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.440]   We can reunite the Beatles.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.600]   The King.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.800]   The King, baby.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.720]   Elvis has his own island.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.200]   Elvis has left the island.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.040]   Serious satellite has this all Elvis all the time channel.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.520]   I love listening to him.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.880]   You don't actually listen to it.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:14:59.880]   You don't actually listen to it.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.680]   Now, and then has the Willie Nelson channel.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.680]   I don't really know.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.440]   I could listen to Willie all day.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.080]   Well, brother, what's the next news item?
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.480]   There is no next news item.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.480]   Good.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.480]   It's a bad time we wrap the show.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:18.520]   I think we ought to stop with Willie Duran and the King and thank everybody for being
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.520]   here.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   John C. Dvorak.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.520]   Now we know why he's cranky.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.880]   He's just smarter than everybody else.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.480]   Dvorak.org/blog.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480]   Robert Herron.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480]   You can see him on D.L.T.V.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.480]   and read his roundup.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.160]   Tell us a little bit about the LCDs.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.080]   Anything exciting to report?
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.680]   I finally found one that I like.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.680]   Really?
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.680]   I got to see where we're going to see this.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.680]   B.C.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.680]   Mag, D.L.T.V.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.680]   I love color.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.320]   Color is one of the most important things to me when it comes to image volume.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.600]   Well, I wouldn't buy a black and white HDTV at this point.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:49.600]   I think that'd be a good fit.
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.600]   The accurate color.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.520]   Not only good saturation, but just accurate color.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.280]   It's expensive to do that on LCD.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.280]   I finally saw a good 32-inch model that I'm going to give an editor's choice to.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:05.240]   Mostly just some buying tips because those for 42 inches, that's the most popular flat
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.400]   panel technology in the world right now.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.200]   My sharp aqua is kind of losing its color.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.200]   Is it really?
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.200]   Do they get worse?
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.200]   Unless it's accepted.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.200]   Maybe it's the settings.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.200]   My kid might know.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.840]   Maybe somebody said you also maybe the bulb in the back could burn it out.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.840]   My kid's playing with this settings probably.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.280]   It's actually a sharp aqua that ended up liking so much.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280]   Oh, you give it away.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   But good.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.280]   I like it too.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.280]   I've been worried about it.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.040]   There's always been popular with consumer reports.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.400]   But this is a newer aqua, which is even more colorful than pre-gens.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.680]   I just unboxed their 57-inch.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.680]   That's arguably.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.680]   Wow.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.880]   It's a $15,000 display.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.880]   Wow.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.360]   Granted, it's like it incorporates the best of every technology you can put into an LCD
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.360]   right now.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.360]   And I got to say, I think it's pretty timely.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.200]   It's a 78-year-old grandmother just got an LCD.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.200]   Really?
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.200]   Nice.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.840]   Or she likes to call it her high distribution television.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.840]   Awesome.
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.520]   I don't think it's the D-stand.
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:59.520]   High distribution.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.680]   The sharp is one of the best panel makers for LCDs.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.200]   I tell you, Matlock on high def, there's nothing to do with it.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.200]   And that's exactly what she's watching.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.200]   Yeah, I know.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200]   I'm murder she wrote in Matlock.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200]   I know.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.360]   Hey, you don't like--
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.400]   I watch a lot of Discovery channel and HD.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.400]   I don't know what you need.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.400]   That's stuff.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.400]   I watch Lost.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   I'm watching weeds.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   I love weeds.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.400]   You know, I love weeds.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.400]   Oh, weeds is another one.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   That's a real cold thing.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.800]   I never watched one because I refuse to get caught.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.800]   I watch it.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800]   It's a great show.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.800]   Oh, no, you're going to love it.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.800]   It's a great show.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.800]   Isn't it good?
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800]   That's why I'm not going to watch it.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.800]   It's fantastic.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.240]   I actually haven't seen a new season just starting at--
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:40.080]   I think the big three NBC and CBS, they're the competition.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.680]   They're getting from the cable networks is tremendous.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.880]   Not to mention YouTube.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.240]   It's crazy.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.040]   Where can we catch Brett Larson these days?
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:53.280]   You can-- well, you can always find me on BrettLarsons.com, a website that probably hasn't been updated in about six months.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.800]   L-A-R-S-O-N.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.800]   Let's not be confused.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:08.800]   You can always catch me on CBS 2 in New York, 10/10 wins radio in New York, the CW 31 in Sacramento, and semi-regularly on CBS News, The Early Show and CBS News, Saturday early.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.800]   You are media maven.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:15.800]   Pretty much anywhere there's a camera with a CBS eye on it, I try and get in front of it.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.800]   Eye on this guy, Brett Larson.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.800]   It's so great to hear from you.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.800]   You've obviously done very well since you escaped the sinking ship that was Tech TV.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.800]   We're glad you survived.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.800]   Thank you.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.800]   I'm glad I did that.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.800]   And it's nice to chat with all you guys again.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.800]   Next time, take the rats with you, will ya?
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.800]   Please, I beg of you.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.800]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:51.800]   You know, I use very expensive hair gel.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.800]   I would be upset if they took it away.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.800]   You've always been kind of a hair gel kind of a guy.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.800]   I know.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.800]   What do you use?
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.800]   It's like 20 bucks a puck.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   Whoa.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   You use puck hair gel?
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.800]   You know, it comes in a little puck.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.800]   It's called something.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.800]   John and I remember that.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.800]   That's the old butcher wax.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.800]   Yeah, the guy who does my hair makes me use it.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.800]   You don't use butch wax, do you?
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.800]   No, no.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.800]   Homme.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:18.800]   Homme.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:19.800]   But didn't butch wax coming up puck?
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800]   Yeah, I think it did.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   I'm gonna have to Google what you guys are talking about.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   I have no idea.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.800]   Which wax, baby?
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   That's the, that's the original pomade that would come up puck.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.800]   There was another one that was, that was more popular.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.800]   It was a short time.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.800]   It wasn't pomade.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.800]   It wasn't which wax.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.800]   It was another one that had a really funny name.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.800]   Uh, real cream?
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.800]   And my own hair on bread was a little dab of do.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   Real cream, real cream, real cream.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.800]   Real cream, a little dab of do ya.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.800]   Real cream, you look so dab of hair.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.800]   Real cream, the guys will offer you y'all.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.800]   They'll have to get their fingers in your hair.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:20:13.800]   (music)
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.800]   (mellow music)
