[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.160]   I am very excited. I'm going to do this. Let's see. Let's first of all introduce Simonde Rushfor
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.480]   who is. Yes, because she is doom quasar on the Twitter. You've seen her and heard her on rocket,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.760]   the great podcast with Christina Warren and Brianna Wu. You've perhaps seen her on the Polygon show.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.600]   She works for Polygon. But she's never unaccountably never been on our shows. And I'm just
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.400]   terribly apologetic to you, Simonde. So welcome. It's about time.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.080]   I'm happy to finally be here. Thank you for having me. Finally. And we were thinking we were going
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.800]   to do a high concept thing. So we got pet. We thought let's do this and make it all French people.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.120]   So we got Patrick Bejean on who is of course from Frenchspin.com. He is one of our favorites.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.000]   You've been how many years have you been doing Twitter at least a decade?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.760]   Oh, wow. Yeah. I think the first time I think I came to the cottage.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.560]   This one is the Brick House. And it was the cottage with Nicole and Mark's Pagnolo.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.120]   We went on a road trip. Yeah. The Wood Whisperer. The Wood Whisperer.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.680]   He's brought me a beautiful cabinet, which still is in my living room. I love it. It's just
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.280]   charging cabinet. Nice. Is that how we met? I had Nicole. That's great. I think so. Maybe it was
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.160]   at podcast expo the year before, something like that. But yeah, it's been a while.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.440]   It has been a while to have you back as always. Thank you for having me back.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.040]   And I want to introduce the newest member of the Twitch family. Now you're all in the family.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.240]   But some closer than others. This guy was a distant cousin and is now my son.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.400]   My son. I've adopted Micah Sergeant. He is joining us at twit.tv. We're very excited.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.800]   We asked him last week, I think. He said unaccountably without even coming to pet
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.400]   aluminum visit. You'd never been here, right? Yeah. You really called me out there, Leo.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.240]   He said, "Okay." I said, "Okay, I'll do it. I'll do it." You know, it was really kind of a no-brainer
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.400]   situation in the end is how I felt about it. And I've lived in California before. Did Lisa tell
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.720]   you how much we're going to pay you? She said two dollars. So you know. So I knew that I'd be
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.080]   able to make it here. Yeah. So we're good. Yeah. From you moving here from St. Joseph, Missouri.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.720]   St. Joseph, Missouri. That's a big move with your puppies. My two dogs. Got Henry and Mizzie,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.080]   the Chihuahas that I probably talk about more than anything on all the Twitch shows. We love them.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.640]   I've seen pictures and they're very... You're going to bring them in the studio, right?
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.680]   Yes. Yeah. I actually think that it's required in my contract that I bring them into the studio.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.320]   Yeah. Lisa, so... Yeah. We got the thumbs up on that. We miss our dogs. So we're going to adopt
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.200]   your Chihuahas as well as you. Anyway, welcome. Micah will be hosting iOS today because
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.760]   kind of coincidentally, because we wanted to hire you anyway. But right about that same time,
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.600]   Megan said, "I've decided I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to be on camera anymore. I
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.360]   want to do more writing." So she's left. So you're going to take over from her.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.240]   Are you going to do Techno's Weekly as well? Yeah. Techno's Weekly as well. So kind of...
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.840]   But the main reason we wanted to bring you in is we have lots of new shows we want you to do.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.120]   So you're going to be very, very busy. Yes. Yes indeed. I'm excited about it. We're thrilled to
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.920]   have you. Thank you. Thanks to all three of you for joining us. So we thought since we have a lot of
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:28.400]   gamers, we should probably talk about gaming. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Well, I mean, the games are fun to talk about.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.120]   How about actually, this is a gaming story that is more than gaming. Remember HQ? Yeah. That fun
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.520]   game with that guy. With that guy. Who everybody's forgotten? What was his name?
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.400]   Scott. Scott Ruggaski. Scott Ruggaski. Scott Ruggaski. Yeah. And he was a big star. And then he left.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.720]   And then the CEO got rid of the other founder. Then the CEO died. And the other founder came back.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:01.200]   It's been kind of crazy. According to TechCrunch, uh, they're pivoting. HQ trivia is laid off about
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.400]   20% of its staff. That's only six or seven people, but still. And they're going to go to a subscription
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:17.280]   model, $10 a month for a program called HQ Words. So instead of them paying you, you pay them.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.160]   Well, I wonder if they're going to still do HQ trivia. I'm not. It's not, it's not clear
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.440]   from this article, but still. This kind of seems like too little, too late. You know, HQ fell out of
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.400]   the public eye so spectacularly what feels like years ago. Um, and now. It wasn't that long ago,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   actually. It does feel like a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah. March, 2018, about a year ago.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.360]   I know who's going to pay that, right? To play a game. I mean, I don't know what what, uh,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.040]   Apple Arcade is going to be that, right? I mean, that's crazy. I think Apple Arcade is going to be
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:02.080]   cheaper. Yeah. Ten bucks a month. You can get Xbox Game Pass. Oh, that's right. Yeah. I mean,
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.800]   obviously it's not aimed at the same kind of players, I suppose, but it better be a really
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.720]   damn entertaining experience. It was only a year ago that HQ trivia was giving out a quarter
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:22.800]   million dollar prize. Uh, money they didn't have. Yeah, it turns out that wasn't a sustainable.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.360]   We shouldn't laugh. We shouldn't laugh. I know. It's very sad. Did, did, uh,
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.120]   HQ words, whatever the hell that is. Heck, that is. Sorry. Nobody's ever heard of it. I know.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.680]   Did it have a, it didn't have a subscription before though, and now they're making it a subscription
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.440]   service? Um, because that sounds like a recipe for very angry customers. If so, people,
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.280]   movie pass showed us that people do not like it when they have to start paying for something
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.320]   they got for free. You still were win money with it, but you pay money to win money seems like,
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:59.120]   uh, gambling. Oh, yeah. The best spool always say it takes money to make money. So that sounds
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.520]   like a completely legitimate must be legit. So it is kind of like trivia, but it's words instead
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:15.520]   of trivia. Um, yeah, I feel bad, but you remember, um, what was the name of that pop game? Remember
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.920]   that pop game? What was it? Uh, I've forgotten it. This was another flash in the pan. I wish
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.360]   me and they sold a zinga at the peak and then the whole thing went down the tubes and then
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:34.880]   zinga went down the tubes. Actually, zinga, yeah, zinga is sort of still around, but they're selling
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:41.360]   all their property in San Francisco in order to stay afloat. So that gives you kind of some idea.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.400]   Zinga took over our building, the old tech, right? Carson, the old tech TV building.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:54.560]   Uh, and I thought the last thing I heard about draw something was the draw something. Wasn't
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.400]   that huge? Yes. Yeah. And then zinga bought it and then nobody played it.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:05.440]   It's for a lot of money and oh, and the other one was OMG pop. Remember that? OMG pop.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.160]   That one doesn't sound familiar to me. That sounds like something Buzzfeed does.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.880]   You're not a gamer. You admitted. Oh, that's true. OMG. I'm googling that. I'm a gamer and I don't
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.640]   know what that is. Thank you. No, I remember. I'm G pop. Maybe you remember. I'm in like with you
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:27.760]   or I L. W. Y. Is that, is that ring a bell? That sounds horrifying. Um, in in 2012, OMG pop
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.960]   was the hottest thing happening. As you can see here, zinga bought it for 200 million dollars.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.280]   Shut it down in one year. What did it do? How old was I? It was a really fun game, but much like,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:49.040]   uh, HQ, it was briefly fun. Oh, it had several different games. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean,
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.880]   there's nothing more. Draw my thing was the big OMG pop game. Draw my thing. Most popular one.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.120]   You know, the name. Just feel too comfortable about saying that.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.640]   Is this reported? You're looking strange. What it was was,
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.840]   "pictionary" basically. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, "pictionary." So it wouldn't always be your thing.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:14.880]   Draw his. It could be somebody else's thing. These are, I'm looking, these are, it looks like,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.800]   this is how you get viruses. Leo. Yeah. Don't, don't go flicking around. Draw my thing online.net.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:28.880]   With, uh, with mobile games is that they rely as much on marketing as they do on,
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:36.320]   uh, game design expertise. And so it's very, very difficult to replicate a success. And that's why
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:42.400]   all of these companies are having so much trouble. They have one game that works really well, but
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:48.960]   usually that's it. The only one that managed to do more than one was, uh, is a supercell.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.480]   And they make games that are very cleverly designed. They are actual, actual good games.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.880]   Yeah. Cause HQ is a trivia contest. There's no, there's nothing special. I think you could argue,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:07.440]   that, uh, Scott Rogowski was the reason for success. He was kind of fun to watch. Yeah. It changed
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.640]   what he left. Listening to those hosts, which I frankly did not, with a couple of times I played
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.600]   it, it becomes this intolerable trivia experience where instead of answering questions, you're
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.440]   sitting there listening to someone banter. Talking, stop, just asking the damn question.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.960]   I want to get this over with. That was kind of the best part. You always knew that people
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.800]   were playing the game because you would hear these little mumbles of like, can we get past
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.960]   those plays? I never really played it myself, but I had, I can remember even, um, colleagues being
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.480]   like, yeah, I'm just going to time my lunch break with the time the game. We would end the show at 6
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.320]   p.m. So I could play HQ. All those are the days and the show was less than four hours. I remember
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:53.600]   that. Yeah. Anyway, uh, this is, yeah, this is kind of a long running story in Silicon Valley.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.320]   These flash in the pan games. Everybody thought HQ was going to be hot. There were a lot of
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.880]   copycats. There were a ton of copycats, none of which took off. And then, yeah, I don't know if
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:10.640]   everybody thought it was going to be hot. It's, it feels like there's a, uh, subsection of the tech,
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   uh, community that thinks games work like tech. And since they know tech, they know games.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.160]   And the two are very different markets and industries. I think that's why we thought, well, you know,
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:31.520]   some of the tech industry thought gaming was going to be, uh, you know, smartphones only forever. And
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:41.840]   there was no room for a, uh, portable console, but the gaming, uh, industry and public is different
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:48.880]   enough from tech that these analyses usually I think don't pan out. So if you want to hear what's
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.200]   happening in gaming, um, you should ask someone who knows gaming. Of course, that doesn't mean,
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.960]   you know, mobile games isn't a thing obviously, but it, I don't even think asking somebody in
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.840]   gaming because I mean, you know, you and Simone and people who cover the whole gaming sphere maybe,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:15.360]   but gaming is so fragmented nowadays that if you ask somebody who's a, uh, you know, call a duty
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.600]   point and shoot first person shooter player, they're not going to know what's going on,
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.800]   even in the battle royale sphere. They're not playing that daddy games.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.360]   Little, that one. Daddy. I don't call them dead. Oh wait. Oh, you mean the specific daddy.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.960]   Yeah. Daddy game. I'm a daddy. What's daddy game? Oh, Leo, I can't believe you just said that.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:41.440]   What is it is a dating simulator where you play as a dad or a sugar dad. Something like that.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.840]   You could get a sugar daddy, but you've moved into a new neighborhood and there's a bunch of other
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.800]   single or not single dads and you date them. You date the dad. I made Ernest Hemingway,
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   injury daddy. He was my character and, um, that was an experience. I don't want to be sexist here,
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.440]   but are you a woman in this game or does it matter? Nope, you're a man. You're a guy. Yeah,
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.280]   you're a dating game. There you go. Dream. Oh, they're all dream. Daddy. It was, it was pretty
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.880]   popular. Uh, one of the most popular games of, uh, was it last year? Oh, and you could design your,
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:21.200]   your dad bod. Yeah. That's nice. Yeah. That's me right there. It can be a woman, actually. I think
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.400]   you can play a woman. Oh, but you would do well in this neighborhood. You can play as a transgender
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:32.480]   man, but you can't play as a woman. A vampire. So this is a category of games. This is so popular.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:38.400]   There's a category of letters. Oh, hell yeah. They're very popular, uh, with, uh, women and I think
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.640]   queer audiences as well. So, uh, uh, I just see, again, that's a perfect example. See, I feel like
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.560]   I, I'm a gamer. I like to play games, but I never even heard of this. Yeah. It's a perfect. I mean,
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.880]   that's the thing about, like you said, games are very fragmented now and you're right in that.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:15:00.320]   One thing that we try to keep in mind at Polygon all the time is everyone is a gamer in some sense
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.240]   of the word and that there is a game that they probably play, whether that is
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.760]   the jeweled or whether it's Call of Duty or Fortnite. And Fortnite especially is very
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.560]   interesting because the people, people play it obsessively, but they don't necessarily
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:21.360]   read coverage of it because they're just in a completely different sphere of gaming, you know?
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.080]   They don't need coverage because Fortnite is one of those categories where you go to Twitch
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:31.680]   and you just watch it and there's, I would get, I would bet even within Fortnite,
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.080]   there are different communities based on which Twitch streamer, you know, if you're in the
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.720]   ninjas community or your, and it's all based on that. Fortnite is a phenomenon. I'm fascinated
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:51.520]   by it. It's for North, Fortnite, the HQ of 20, whatever you're wearing.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.240]   How could you ask such a thing? I'm very upset.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:03.840]   My mind is exploding. Are you a Fortnite? Are you a Fortnite? No, I'm not. And that's what makes
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.520]   me inaccessible to the youth. The youths love Fortnite, but I, you know, and I love, actually,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.360]   love Fortnite. I think Fortnite is, well, let me explain.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:19.520]   It's a really incredibly designed game. I really think the design and the ingenuity and the
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:25.600]   cleverness that goes into it is fantastic. Brilliant, brilliant model, a financial model
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.040]   on the part of Epic because they've made billions and billions out of it by giving away a free game.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:37.600]   So that's well done. I see teenagers, it's in many cases, if you're 14, that's your community,
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.240]   is Fortnite. That's where you live. That's where you, everything that happens to you,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.120]   happens, revolves around that. It's incredibly addictive and compelling.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.200]   The only reason I'm not a Fortnite is because I get waxed a minute I parachute in.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.840]   I mean, dead. I'm dead. Now, what they did nicely with Fortnite is you don't leave the game.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.680]   You just watch the guy who killed you get killed and then you watch him and then they keep watching
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.280]   till you get to the end of the game. So you can watch the whole game. Very watchable game.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.800]   Very watchable. That's the other thing they did well. It's a perfect e-sport game.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.960]   But I can't claim to be a Fortnite or only because I can't survive. It's too long.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.320]   I don't know that it's necessarily a perfect e-sport because I think the reason people
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.040]   like watching it is because they find personalities that they enjoy watching.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.160]   Like, washmallow ninja.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.560]   Like, washmallow ninja.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:30.720]   Like, yeah, exactly. I mean, like the time that ninja streamed with Drake was huge and it was
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.000]   because it's like, oh my god, Drake is playing Fortnite. This is wild.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.800]   By the way, there are people listening to this show who just heard three things they don't even
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.640]   know what it means. Ninja streamed with Drake Fortnite. What?
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:52.240]   Do you guys talk about words perfect at all? Corral? Anything like that? You could talk about
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.200]   anything like that. So no, I agree with you. It's a social societal phenomenon, but is it a flash
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:03.040]   in the pan? I'm kind of more curious. I don't think it's already outlived. The flash in the pan.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:09.120]   I guess so. I mean, I guess. It seems like it's maybe it's not a flash in the pan, but it's one of
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:16.320]   those very unique phenomenons that is as a center of many different things that make it as successful
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.920]   as it is. And I don't know that there will be a lot of games like this, you know, to the level where
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:30.880]   you actually have cultural products that advertise in Fortnite. Look at this. They just added strange
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:39.040]   things portals. Exactly. It's become so widespread across a certain cross-section of the population
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:47.440]   that the things like what well, Avengers was in the game, but that was more of a collaboration
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:56.400]   thing. But then John Wick had a cross promotion thing for and now. Stranger things season three,
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:03.120]   it is very unique. I don't think any other game has had quite that impact. And really, it was a copy
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:03.600]   of.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:11.280]   FUBG. FUBG initially. And then along came Apex Legends and everybody said, Oh, it's over for
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:17.360]   Fortnite. Apex Legends is growing faster than Fortnite ever did. And what is Apex Legends? Still around
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:24.080]   no. I mean, they are definitely not. You know, play Apex Legends? The kids who say, I'm not
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.920]   gonna play Fortnite. I don't want to be kidding for me. I'm playing Apex Legends. Exactly.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.360]   Sorry. Because there's six months older than the guy playing Fortnite.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:40.080]   Your point about it being a social experience for teens is so important because I think that is
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:46.000]   what defines Fortnite is that it is a social network for young people. And it's also an advertising
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.600]   machine, which is why we see Stranger Things in there. And John Wick being advertised to
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:20:00.720]   kids. Can there is immortal? So can you explain though? So we say Fortnite is a social media platform,
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.840]   but I'm the lobby, right? It's the lobby. So in the game, you can you can. What's your killing
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.200]   people? So you have to do that like via Twitch or something else. You're in the lobby. There's a
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.640]   big lobby. You can. So the game itself has communication. Yeah, you can turn on or off
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:21.040]   the game chat, which depending on your experience can be good or bad. Sometimes I mean, I've heard
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.000]   a lot of stories about people, you know, linking up with another person and having a really good
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.680]   experience. I especially love stories of like people my age linking up with like a kid who's like,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.440]   I don't know how to play, but I'm having a good time and like being able to be a good role model
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.840]   for them, which I love. But then there are jerks as well. So you know, it's a crapshoot.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.640]   So is it kind of a two? There seems like there are two forks. There's there are the people who
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:50.480]   like to watch it. And Simone, you kind of talked about that being for the personalities that play
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.720]   the game. Like my little brother, he lives in Florida and streams Fortnite for a living.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   Your little brother is a professional Fortnite. Yeah, he does. He's living the dream, my friends.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.400]   I'm living the nightmare. Yeah, I was going to say, then that sounds like the nightmare as you can
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.120]   asking. Well, the game not so much. It's starting to be a grind for him. Yeah, and that was going to
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.160]   be my next question. What do you think is the thing that gets the personalities into this game? Is
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.680]   there something about this game in particular? Or is it just because there are enough people
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.480]   interested in this game that they're choosing to sort of. That's a great question. Walk onto it.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:33.520]   I don't know that I can answer that because I feel I was foolishly late to Fortnite. I was not
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.480]   paying attention to it because I did think it was going to be like PUBG and just I was playing PUBG
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.560]   at the time and I thought, Oh, whatever Fortnite. I don't care about that. And I missed the moment
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:49.600]   when it truly ignited. And you're not a gamer. You just lost all street cred. Bye bye. Bye.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.840]   Because I don't play Fortnite. It's the opposite of that. Yes. That's how the gamer community is,
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:01.680]   by the way. If you don't play that meal, leo, stop your losing a little bit of your credibility here.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.360]   No, that's why they're hateful. If you haven't played dream data, you're all
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.600]   in that sense. In that sense, sure. But I mean, the gamer community, an older
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:16.400]   hatefulness would probably consider Fortnite not to be a real game. That's right. Exactly.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:22.080]   Yep. It's really what is really unfortunate about the so-called gamer community.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.360]   It's very judgmental. We're going to get in trouble.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.600]   I don't care. I already get hate mail from the gamer. Oh, man.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:37.680]   On half gamers, I apologize. I think you're a gamer if you play games, right? Even if it's
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.640]   scrabble. You're, you know, if you're playing words with friends, aren't you a gamer?
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.320]   Yeah. In the technical. I think so. Games and mobile, I was hating on mobile.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.040]   Or maybe people could understand me hating on mobile when I was saying things earlier.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:58.160]   That's not the case. Certainly, mobile has expanded the meaning of what a game is and what a gamer
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:04.080]   is. There are many, many different kinds of gamers nowadays, much more than a few years ago.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:10.960]   And everyone's a gamer. That's completely true. What, you know, the quote unquote,
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.680]   real gamers will say, well, those are not this. I think it's fair to say it's not the same kind of
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:22.880]   game. Just like maybe a, you know, if you like action movies, you're not necessarily going to like
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:29.680]   the outer Sundance kind of thing. But you might. There is a different friend in our culture
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:37.280]   where we're certain things have become taboo because it's too risky, for instance, to say
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:42.720]   something about gamers is too risky. And so people just don't even talk about this. After gamer
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.920]   gate, it's like, oh, that's a third rail. It's like talking about the president. It's a third rail.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:55.920]   And so everybody avoids it. And as a result, we're not talking about some of the most important
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.760]   issues in society. So I'll stay away from the president, but let's talk about gaming
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.400]   for a minute. The technical destination is somebody who plays a game. That's not what gamers,
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:11.440]   so-called gamers think of as a game. It's whoever plays the games I like is a gamer.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:17.200]   It's a weird thing because a lot of people have pointed out, you know, we don't call people who
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:24.880]   enjoy TV. TV years. Because that's silly. There's so many different kinds of TV. But we have, I think
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:31.360]   just because of what a niche hobby playing video games was in the past kind of made it into a
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.640]   category that may not necessarily make sense. Well, you said something interesting. Your taxonomy
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.000]   level right now in the past has changed now, hasn't it? So for instance, I spent 20 hours
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.280]   minimum 20 hours this week playing Harry Potter, Wizard's Unite.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:54.880]   Now, the reactions to that are going to range from your horror, Simone, or was it joy? I couldn't
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:03.920]   tell. It was kind of bull. We're going to range from horror to joy, to joy, to joy, horror to people
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:11.040]   saying, well, that's not a game. And everything in between, right? So that's why probably the other
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.600]   reason for nights, I want to stay with this. Why is Fortnite so successful? Because it's interesting,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   is partly because once you're us, one of us, part of being one of us is the other is all bad. You
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.360]   know, them, you have to have us versus them. Wait, who's the us? Yes, it's Fortnighters.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.760]   Okay, Fortnighters versus them. So people play Fortnite probably think they are the only true
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:38.240]   gamers. I know I don't think that's really true. Because I don't think that kids are thinking of
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:44.080]   it in that way. I think that they think of it more as a place to hang out with their friends or a
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:51.200]   common activity. Although there is the element of skins and bullying over skins that we can get into.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:57.440]   I could see, you know, there are some games that are super intense and you like set up a land party
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.160]   and you play these games and you try to rank like, I don't know, ones that have lots of guns and
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:08.480]   are militaristic. And ones where you have to have very expensive computer systems to run them and
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.600]   that kind of thing. And though I feel like these are, you talked earlier about the fragmentation sort
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:20.800]   of of what the sort of gaming industry is and what gaming involves. And I think that that also plays
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:28.560]   into which groups are being those sort of you or they and we are us. Because I think that
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.600]   Georgia Dow is an example of someone who knows how to play some more complicated games but she
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.120]   is our own virtual reality room in her house. Right. And he has three virtuals. Three. Exactly.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.280]   And she plays the bejeweled and stuff like that. And so belonging to those different groups. Those
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.400]   are the lines of blurred. Yeah, exactly. I don't think that it's necessarily as a whole. But when
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:54.080]   I play Fortnite, when I go in and play Fortnite, I'm a default. What does that mean? Yes. I'm a default.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:27:03.680]   You're a big nerd. I didn't buy a special skin. Oh, you're using the default appearance of the
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:11.360]   character you're playing and you have a money thing. Yeah. Most wearing the Kmart shoes instead of
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:17.440]   very nice. You kids are getting bullied into and here's the tweet from downtown Josh Brown,
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.160]   the nine year old boys in my house don't call each other losers. They say he's a default.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.800]   It's a term for Fortnite players who haven't earned better skins yet. It's the equivalent
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.000]   of the old Twitter eggs. Okay, earned. This is so can you get them without some but the best skins
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.560]   you have to buy. Yeah. The most of those. That's how they make money because the game is free to
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:43.120]   play. Remember. But I mean, that article was amazing and it certainly opened my eyes and I'm sure
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:49.520]   many other people's eyes to what's happening there. But I think also, you know, it's not a
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:57.360]   it's not like bullying started with Fortnite. And again, Fortnite is such a unique phenomenon
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:04.160]   in the gaming world. I would be very hesitant to draw any conclusions from what's happening there
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:13.680]   and apply them to a large section of the gaming industry. I would also venture that I think the
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:22.800]   fragmented and hateful nature of game communities is I don't want to say a thing of the past and
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:30.560]   maybe Simone, you have a different look on that. But I think after gamer gate, which certainly
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:41.200]   hurt us a lot, there was a reaction to it that was slow but deeper that kind of forced us to look
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.520]   at how we were behaving in that sense and break the barriers down a little bit. And certainly,
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.400]   there are still, you know, the idiots are still going to be idiots. But I think everyone else,
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.000]   not everyone, a good portion of other people started understanding what was happening there
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.240]   and paying a little bit more attention. That's the way I think it's at least starting. Simone,
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.880]   maybe you have a yeah, maybe you would disagree with me.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:14.480]   I don't disagree. I think that there are still problems in gaming. I think it's kind of as it
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.680]   always has been that there is a small group of people who are very, very loud and very,
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:28.480]   very angry and very, very mean. But I do think that in the larger sense, companies are being conscious
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:36.240]   of being more inclusive in their video games. And also certainly, I mean, the world's eyes are
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:45.760]   opened to what happens when you let a hateful group of people kind of run rampant over a hobby,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:51.440]   you know, without anyone stepping in and saying, hey, cut it out. I think that there are still
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.000]   scars definitely on the gaming community from that.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.440]   It's also the case that the gaming community is very diverse. So there's kids playing Fortnite,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:08.160]   there's dads playing Call of Duty. And dad's playing Dream Daddy and Dream Daddy. And there's
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.720]   moms playing words with friends or bejeweled. I mean, there's a very, I mean, that's a little
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.200]   stereotypical all the way around. But I think that it does very much as a variety of communities.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:23.600]   So you can't really talk about a gamer community as one. That's what I that's how I'm feeling about
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.960]   it. And I think that that kind of that sort of situation applies itself to a lot of things because,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:35.600]   you know, we all have these little groups. And we like to see these little groups as bigger
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.880]   groups, because that means that more people agree with what I agree with. And so whereas,
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:46.320]   you know, I think that if I if I'm not taking the time to be empathetic and understanding that
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.600]   others have different opinions and thoughts than I do and experiences, then I start to think that
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:58.160]   everybody who wears an Apple watch is going to get as many notifications as I do. So the
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.240]   notifications on the Apple watch are annoying. Whereas for the regular consumer, that might not
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:08.080]   be the case. And so what I'm saying here is, I think that those things can apply to all sorts of
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:16.880]   industries and all sorts of subjects where we can sort of over engulf what is a larger thing.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:23.440]   We realize it's a human trait. Yeah. Frankly, if you everything we do as a human is playing a
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.000]   game of some kind, whether it's a game to make more money, the game to have a nicer,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.120]   there are many, many games in the world. And it is unfortunate that one of the human one
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:39.440]   human trait is this us versus them tribalism. It's built into our very base brain. Not surprising.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.720]   And I do think that's not a issue specific to games. That's something that's definitely been
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.440]   exacerbated by the internet and it's just kind of built into us, which is suck.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.080]   Sucky. When you go to packs, when you go to packs, is that a kinder gentler when you get
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.800]   there? It seems it always looks in the outside. Yeah. From the outside, it looks like everybody's
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.520]   getting along. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, I can't speak for everyone who's gone to packs and had an
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:13.840]   experience there. I mean, that company has had their kerfuffles and run in the past, but I've
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.640]   always found packs specifically as a convention to be really nice and a really good time.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.200]   And I mean, you can see the whole community on display at packs. Like if there's all kinds of
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:29.120]   people there. So I really like it. Yeah. One of the differences, or I hope at least,
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.960]   one of the reasons why we're seeing slow progress, but progress being made in the
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:46.080]   good direction is that in the gaming industry, we have kind of adults in charge, I'd like to think.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:54.720]   The companies are listening, not necessarily listening to the noise. The gamer gate did not
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:00.320]   have an effect on what kind of games or the opposite effect on what kind of games are being
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:07.920]   made. The people in charge saw that there was a representation problem and that it needed fixing.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:15.440]   And slowly we're starting to see these things happen. So I hope that this is showing that we're,
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   you know, the industry is, because we have adults in there doing things differently than what you
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:31.600]   might think when you're seeing what the community is doing. So yeah, I think that's not inaccurate.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:39.360]   Yeah, I think for bigger companies, certainly they are very aware of that. There are still
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:47.440]   issues with, for example, just this week, the developers of Mordau are having a communication
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:53.760]   issue where someone on the Steam forums who's involved in the game said that there would be a patch
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.560]   that would allow people to toggle off the presence of women and people of color in that game because,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:06.320]   just to basically satisfy people who enjoy a vision of white Europe. And the PR company that
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.800]   manages that game is like, no, we're not doing that. We're not doing that. That's a no, nobody's
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.880]   talking about doing that. So I think that there are still instances, unfortunately, where
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:24.320]   companies want to appease their perceived audience and will, sure, I don't want to use the word
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.520]   pander, but it's the ones coming to mind just lean in that direction. And it might be a direction
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:35.360]   that's not as inclusive as we want games to be. The thing that to me is the most interesting
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:42.000]   about this and we'll move on. But is this is the first time that an entertainment medium has had
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   such its fingers so deep into our culture. Movies, TV, all have had, you know, deep impacts on our
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.440]   culture, but they were always kind of that's the movie industry. That's a TV industry. Gaming is a
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:02.080]   seems to be a more intimate way of consuming media or entertainment and as much more a part of our
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.440]   lives. And I think that's why there's so much emotional drama and going on around it much more
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.480]   so just as you pointed out, Simone, nobody says I'm a TV ear. I mean, you can say I love movies.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.040]   I do love movies, but I'm not going to fight you over Justice League versus, you know, Batman.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:25.520]   But that's that tribalism. Like that's it goes back to that. I brought up the comic books. Yes.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.640]   Okay. Which one are you?
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:36.320]   Until DC canceled magazine, by the way. And then I am no longer a DC guy. That makes me really
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.960]   angry, but you could blame not DC, but AT&T for that. There's more engagement involved, which you're
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:45.840]   kind of talking about there with with a movie with television. Yeah, there's sort of these things
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   that you can passively enjoy. But with a game, I've got to be focused. I've got to be, you know,
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:58.000]   playing and engaged. And so by default, we give more of our attention to those things, which then
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:05.120]   lets those ads and what have you the people that are teaming up with these companies get deeper
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.400]   access to our attention. So yeah, I agree with you there that that level of engagement that's
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:17.920]   required gives nobody says sign fell for life, right? Honestly, I think it's teenage boys.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:24.080]   It's very good. But that's a mistake. You're looking at it too too deeply. Okay. Maybe I'm wrong,
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.480]   but I think it's a lot of teenage boys care about the stuff. If a gamer gate was not just teenage
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.800]   boys by any means, was it? I want to get at what Michael was saying about, um,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.480]   engagement and advertising. Yeah, I do this when I'm thinking of push my nose. You don't see that
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.560]   when I record rock because there's cameras. Holy moly, I just explains why you have such a
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   pert nose. It used to be like Pinocchio, but you've been pushing it in. Okay. 28 years of podcasting,
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.680]   baby. But no, I think that returning kind of looping this back, closing the circle, going back to
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:04.480]   mobile games like HQ that are kind of flash in the pants or like Candy Crush, for example, those ones
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:11.200]   that exist kind of just to hook you in and burn through you. What does distinguish those mobile
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.760]   games from other games, I think, and what makes them flashes in the pan is that they compel you
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.440]   to play a lot in a very short amount of time. And I think then the wider audience burns out on that
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.160]   experience and you're left with those core whales that are spending the money on those games. But
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.160]   everyone else has moved on to the next thing because they're sick of it. Except it hasn't
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.760]   happened with that or has it has it happened with Fortnite? I don't think so. That's that
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:39.840]   reaction that that that joy horror that Simone had earlier, I think, was about that. You're talking
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:45.760]   about Harry Potter, wizards unite and you play it so much. You're going to stick with it after
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.240]   everybody else goes away. I have a heavy investment at this point. That's like Renee Richie and, uh,
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.360]   Pokemon. I almost had Pikachu. Yes. Pokemon go. Yeah. Renee Richie is still playing Pokemon
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.040]   go. Oh, heavens. Yes. I thought he switched to Harry Potter. I think he's playing both,
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.680]   but I don't think he'll ever give up Pokemon go. He said that, uh, uh,
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.680]   wizards unite was too much of a game. Yeah, too complicated too much. He doesn't want to play.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.320]   He doesn't want to do all the mechanics. Pokemon go. Maybe I'm a gamer then because I love
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:19.360]   wizards unite. I do too. Or am I a gamer Leo? Hmm. Wait, hold on. He's putting in their quotes.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:26.480]   This is how we think Leo. Everybody touch your nose. Click your heels three times. All right.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.920]   And then give you scare quotes. All right. We're going to, uh, we're going to take a little,
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.800]   we're going to take a little break and come back in just a second. That's our gaming segment.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.960]   There's more we could talk about. I guess we could talk a little bit about Patrick has a scoop.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:44.960]   A scoop. What? Well, maybe not a scoop. Yes. A prediction. A prediction. All right.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.840]   That we want to talk about and the and lots more Johnny I've leaving Apple. What does that mean?
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.720]   Immediately after Johnny I've announces he's leaving Ming Chi Quo says Apple's going to change
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.760]   the butterfly. He's getting rid of the butterfly keyboard. It's like, oh, well, we know we can
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:05.920]   blame for that. Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage. So glad to welcome Rocket Mortgage

[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.920]   I should mention this because you said an interesting thing, Patrick Beja. You said you thought
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.920]   Microsoft's streaming platform, which is coming out next year, will be also not just on the Xbox,
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.840]   but on the PlayStation. Why would they do that? Why would Sony do that?
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:16.240]   I think there's a possibility it will happen down the line once we have a solid infrastructure
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:22.960]   of the trends that are happening now, which are streaming and subscription.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:29.920]   And every single device in your home has a good controller. So anything can become a
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:36.560]   traditional console game machine. That's the promise of Google's Stadia, right?
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:46.400]   Google Stadia and others that are also being worked on by Microsoft and Sony and possibly others.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.640]   I think Stadia is actually going to become the streaming service for everyone, meaning for
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.120]   every company. Microsoft is going to have their own, Sony is going to have their own.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:02.800]   And the reason they don't have a subscription service at Google for Stadia is that they want to
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:10.720]   be the one for Ubisoft, Bethesda, every other gaming company. So those companies would have a
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.520]   subscription service where you install the games on PC. But if you want to use their services on
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:22.320]   another device, you can use Google Stadia to stream them to any device. So that's one thing.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:28.880]   But the PlayStation aspect of it is in that world, imagine that world where any device is
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:37.920]   your, can be used to stream traditional console games, you as a PlayStation owner,
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:46.080]   hardware device owner, have the option to go and try a Microsoft game anyway, whether or not there's
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:52.960]   not the, you know, barrier to entry, which is going out to buy an Xbox anymore. You can just
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:58.720]   press a button and play on your Apple TV or your Android box or anything. And in that world,
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:09.360]   what does Sony do? Is it more clever for them to not have the competing service on their device
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:17.200]   and not get any money from it? Or have it because their customers will use it anyway if they want to
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   and take a cut? And I think if you know you want to see the world as it will be, if everything works
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.920]   out like that, it's more clever to just put it on your service. And at least since everyone's going
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:38.560]   to be able to try those games anyway, at least you get a little bit of money from it. So I'm not 100%
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:45.520]   sure it's going to happen because Microsoft and Sony are, you know, competitors, but Apple has
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:52.960]   Google Maps on its device. Or so I think it might, it might happen. There's definitely a possibility
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.320]   which today when you look at the way the market is structured today, it's heresy to think of
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.320]   something like that. It actually matches what's been happening in the rest of technology.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:09.200]   Microsoft's a really good example of this, where historically these companies wanted to put up,
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.800]   and I think this is a good trend. I'm hoping it will happen more. Put up barriers, silos,
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.280]   competitive barriers. So you either buy an Xbox or you buy a PlayStation and you either play
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:26.800]   Xbox games or PlayStation games, but never both. Microsoft has finally decided for years it said,
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.240]   it's Windows, it's Office, we're going to make our money, selling boxes full of empty air and a lot
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:38.320]   of bits. And they did very well in the 90s, they did okay in the 2000s, but a big shift five years
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.000]   ago when Satya Nadella said, you know, that's not the way the future is going to be. It's going to
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.200]   be much more platform agnostic operating systems to make a lot of sense. We're going to be in the
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.920]   cloud and we and he said, tellingly, we will be wherever our customers want us to be,
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:58.720]   even if it's on Apple. And in fact, Microsoft Office, the jewel in the crown, the touch first
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.800]   version of Office, arguably the future of Office came out on the iPad before it came out on any
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:09.280]   Windows platform. And I think that's a trend. I hope that's a trend. And if that's the case,
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.000]   then it would make sense that Microsoft and Sony might bury the hatchet and
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.080]   piece cross platform. Certainly Microsoft's there already. Microsoft is old for this.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:26.480]   Yeah, they like it. Yeah. The whole that when Fortnite went cross platform play on Xbox and
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:32.240]   Switch and Sony did not allow cross play with other platforms, everyone just rubbed their noses
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:38.480]   in it for a good while. Yeah. And then they changed their policy. So I think eventually,
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.440]   and I don't have any insight to this, but I think eventually they would have to see that their policy
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.960]   is just not helpful. It's not what consumers want. Can you think you could divide up the
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:54.160]   technology in the stream to the people with the future on their side, like Microsoft?
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.120]   And then the people who are living still in the past, like Sony, trying to protect
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:05.040]   their rent seeking, trying to protect their little sandbox. Yeah. And you know,
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.200]   who I think of in that category is Apple. Now, nobody traditionally nobody says,
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:14.800]   oh, Apple's the past, but I think increasingly Apple does look like this is an old fashioned
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:19.280]   way to view your business. Like you better use all Apple if you want everything to work.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.560]   That's a fair, fair argument that they don't make messages for Android. I'm surprised they still
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.920]   offer iTunes, but they different when they bought texture, they immediately killed the
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.160]   Android version of texture folded in Apple news. And you have to use an iPhone.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:38.880]   But I feel that we might be seeing that changing very soon. We were Apple for Apple,
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:44.320]   because every single financial call in the last, I don't know how many that I have transcribed
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:48.080]   services services services and right after we see services,
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.840]   services are crass platform. Yes. And what was it? The Samsung smart TVs have an Apple TV app.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:59.200]   Think of it. That's right. We've got all of these little changes that are taking place that I think
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.520]   are sort of the writing being on the wall here. I find that really encouraging because I hate
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:09.360]   the idea of silos. I hate the idea of the so-called ecosystem walk-in where you say, well, if you want
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.760]   stuff to work better, you just better buy all Apple hardware. That's how a hardware company thinks.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:18.640]   Mm hmm. And then you don't get to use a cool thing like this with, you know, if you're super
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.440]   locked into one thing. It's pointing at my fabulous Surface Studio. It's so nice. It's very
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:29.600]   beautiful. If this were only an iPad, I'd be so much happier. I just, I want a 30 inch iPad.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:36.560]   That's what I want. Yeah. I think it's a different case though because in Apple's business model,
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:43.040]   a lot of their money comes from selling the devices, which is not the same, you know, as an
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:50.480]   example in the gaming industry, the hardware makes little to no money. Nintendo is a little bit of
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:57.200]   a holdout there. But for Sony, the consoles is the way to get you in the door. The reason Apple is
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:05.280]   making services and trying to improve those is to sell you more of their expensive hardware.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.880]   Yeah. Now down the line, sure, it could happen if services become a significant part of their
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:19.120]   revenue. I think it's not at all unrealistic to think they would transition. But at this point,
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.960]   I think it's not, you know, the strategy is to support hardware with things that are exclusive.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:32.880]   So if those exclusive things are everywhere, then it loses the whole thing loses value.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.560]   I might disagree with you because really the reason they started focusing on services, in my
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:42.080]   opinion, is iPhone sales were tailing off. They weren't making as much money in hardware.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:47.040]   And they were saying, crap, what are we going to do? What we're going to replace that in revenue
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.880]   by making more money per existing customer?
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:56.560]   I mean, because at some point we've talked about this before, the saturation,
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.280]   once everybody who wants one of these stupid things has one, then what do you do? And that's
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.520]   where not only within your existing customer base, which is where they started, do you get
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:11.200]   those Apple music subscriptions? But then you have to start to look outward. And that's when you start
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:17.360]   to look at the fact that not all, like that you can have customers that don't use an iPhone
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.600]   if you decide to go cross platform. I mean, I certainly with Apple TV, they're going to
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:27.120]   have to do that. Right? Yeah. I mean, you know, you don't get Jennifer Aniston doing a TV show
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.160]   for you if you say, but Jennifer, no, only people who own Apple TVs will be able to see it. That's
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:39.360]   just not going to work. Right. Unless you throw a lot of money. Yeah. Maybe Jennifer, you will get,
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.400]   I don't know. Oprah. And is a lot of money that you need to pay Jennifer Aniston?
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:50.800]   Is that a lot of money compared to iPhone sales? No, I mean, I'm still- It's a fraction.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:57.040]   Right. But interestingly, in fact, I think it was Eddie Q that was talking about this,
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:02.800]   did an interview. He said, "We are not going to spend the kind of money that Netflix is spending.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:09.360]   Netflix last year spent $8 billion Apple spent $1 billion. And Q said, and that's our plan going
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.240]   forward. We're not going to try to make as many shows as Netflix does. We're going to focus on a
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:20.480]   few good shows. They don't want to take on that juggernaut. They don't want to be 6 HBO.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:25.760]   Also, they can't. They don't have the same market saturation that Netflix has with Apple TV. I don't
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:33.200]   think. Well, that's exactly precisely the point. So if you say, well, maybe we'll install Apple TV
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:39.840]   on Samsung TVs and maybe we'll, you know, you look at Roku. I mean, Roku is everywhere. They,
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.600]   what is, I just saw the market share at something like 60%. It's a huge market share.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:49.120]   Yeah. I just became part of that market share. You got your first Apple TV.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.400]   My first Roku.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.400]   My first Roku.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.920]   Daily O. Today, I got my first Roku.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.720]   But the only reason you wouldn't get a Roku is because you bought shows from Apple.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.960]   Because it doesn't have every single thing an Apple TV does except for iTunes.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.360]   For a fraction of the price.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:12.720]   That's what, don't get me started on the Apple TV, which is my Netflix box.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.320]   My way to expensive Netflix. But it's the best way to watch Netflix.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.360]   Isn't it? The best way to watch Netflix?
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.800]   I think technically it is because Apple
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:27.440]   caches the Netflix content on their servers. I think they're on off.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:33.200]   Really? Yeah. And so you're getting it not from Netflix, but getting it from Apple and
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.000]   you're getting it better. I'm trying to make you feel better. Thank you.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.240]   Why is I saying on this?
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.120]   And now I know it's for cash.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.960]   For and don't get lambs TV back.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:48.160]   If you had an Apple TV one, you have definitely stepped up.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.040]   Almost anything you bought would be better than the Apple TV one.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.240]   You are not the one that looks like a Mac mini, right? Not that one.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:59.600]   It looks like a Mac mini. It has a remote that is just like a single piece of flimsy
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:07.920]   metal that is the most unpleasant thing to hold. The funny thing is they've improved the TV,
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:12.080]   but the remote still is the worst remote you've ever used. It still is bad.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:17.840]   I reached the breaking point where I was like, no, I'm not going to use this UI for one more day.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:21.200]   I'm not going to hold this crappy remote that has no home button.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:26.720]   And then you throw the remote of the TV and it doesn't even reach all the way because it's so
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:33.440]   light. It just kind of flutters. It's very dissatisfied. I want a remote. I can break the TV remote.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.080]   Yeah, nap it in. You don't like it? Who are you? You like it?
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.200]   Because you're a French. You don't know any better. That's all.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.360]   Probably that must be the reason. I don't know anyone who likes it.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:51.440]   This is the worst remote ever made. Do you not accidentally change? Look, it's fluttering in my
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:58.240]   way. Do you not accidentally change the channel? Because just by chance, this whole top half of
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:04.480]   the remote is like a swiping mechanism. So you've got it on the arm of your sofa and you just
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:09.200]   brush over it and suddenly you're half an hour ahead in the show. Does that not happen to you?
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:15.040]   Oh, I put the TV on the remote on the TV table. I put it in the drawer.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:20.240]   My dogs. My dogs are always zooming through shows. Yes. One of my dogs will hop up.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.240]   Chihuahua can zoom through a show.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.760]   The ball just barely blushes up against.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.160]   That's the secret. I'm like, no, Missy. No.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.480]   Are you comparing yourself to a Chihuahua?
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.400]   In some ways? Yeah.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.600]   You like Chihuahuas. Yeah. I want to be on Micah's good side.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.320]   Well, my left side is my good side.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:43.040]   Same kind of mistake. So Micah, as he joined the company, got his own computer and weirdly enough,
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:47.280]   he chose a MacBook Pro with that horrible butterfly keyboard. Do you like that butterfly keyboard?
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:47.440]   No.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.720]   Does anybody like the butterfly keyboard? Well, I don't know what it is.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.000]   Lisa does. My wife does.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.920]   It's dysfunctional. Besides having no travel and stubbing your fingers,
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.400]   if we get crumb-- Yeah, it hurts. It just hurts my fingers.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.760]   It gets crumbs in it and it breaks and it's an $800 repair.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:09.920]   For the longest time, Apple said, oh, very-- What do they say? A small number of people have
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:13.600]   trouble with this keyboard. Then Johnny I believes--
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.080]   That's the worst way of saying it. You know, every company now says that.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.320]   A small number of percentage is the 17 million.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.560]   1% of the percentage is the key word, the key cheat, right?
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.720]   Oh, it's a small percentage. Yeah.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.400]   1% is 1.7 million people or something. Yeah.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.320]   So according to Ming Chi Quo-- And admittedly, this is a rumor.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:43.200]   But I think it's a great rumor. Ming Chi Quo is an analyst in Taiwan who has great access into
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:48.720]   the supply chain. He has heard that Apple is going to source its keyboard from a new company
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:54.640]   and it will be a scissor switch, the same style switch. Everybody else in the industry uses
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:55:00.880]   a band in the "Hats Butterfly" design. Quo said Apple's butterfly design was expensive to
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:08.240]   manufacture due to low yields. But that's kind of a shock that Apple would stick with an expensive
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:14.880]   to manufacture and expensive to repair a keyboard that everybody hates. Seems kind of contrary.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.200]   I don't understand why. But maybe that's Johnny.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.360]   Johnny says, "No, it's got to be thinner. It's got to be thinner."
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.360]   And now that Johnny's gone, I just can see he's Tim Cook-going.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:29.200]   Is he gone? Is he gone? Bring out the scissor keys!
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.400]   Anyway, I hope it's not just a wrong rumor. I hope it's true.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.200]   I hope so too.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.360]   It would be nice and I'm sorry you got that laptop.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.840]   Look, we're going to figure out how to maybe they'll offer, I fix it, we'll offer a kit to
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.080]   you. The Touch Bar is fun. What I like is having Touch ID.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.680]   Ready. Fingerprint's good.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.000]   Fingerprint's great. Give me Face ID and we're good.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.880]   But I love having Touch ID. The bar's fine. The keyboard. Yeah, not great.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.920]   We'll have to have some trouble.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.360]   I'm curious what you all think of this.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:04.720]   If this is true, I will be so validated because I have been clinging to my 2015-13
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.920]   Macbook Pro. I love it. I don't care that it's thick.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:13.360]   I find it pleasurable. Gonna regret saying that, but it's a good size.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.760]   I find it a pleasurable keyboard.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:21.200]   I like keys that travel a long way every time I touch.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:21.920]   Everyone does.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.360]   I think that the rumor is probably true.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.080]   They have to do something about this keyboard situation.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.360]   They just have to.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.040]   I don't think it's related to Johnny I've been big though.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.360]   Probably. I think it's probably.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:45.040]   The question is going to be, is the new keyboard going to be as thin or thinner as the current one?
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.000]   It might be that it has just as bad travel size.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.280]   Make it thicker.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:54.320]   Put more battery. Nobody says, "Oh, these are so thick."
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.200]   The obsession with thin hardware is exciting.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.120]   That's from Johnny I've.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.080]   That's from Johnny I've.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.320]   And I'll tell you how you'll know it was Johnny I've.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.440]   If Apple fixes this remote, next spring.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:05.920]   Yes.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.640]   And you know it was Johnny.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.880]   The remote is fine.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:24.240]   But the size of the laptops, I think, is, if you look at the 2015 MacBook Pros,
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:31.520]   they are noticeably thicker. And if you ask an average consumer,
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.480]   I think they would agree that they like the thinner one more.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:41.040]   Maybe reality would prove me wrong, but I'm sticking to my story.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.000]   I really think thinner in this case is better.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:51.280]   It feels very fancy, but I like the heft of the 2015 MacBook.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:58.320]   It feels just solid and dependable, and it might not be as pretty as the new ones.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:02.480]   And if you're ever being attacked by a pigeon, you know you can use it as a weapon.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.440]   Yes.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:07.040]   I will and have and will again.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:16.080]   I mean, if your keyboard is breaking, every iteration of your keyboard is breaking four
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:16.880]   years in a row.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.960]   Something's got to change.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:22.480]   And that's the real question is why was Apple so loyal to this?
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:25.040]   Yeah, they were in the face of all.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:30.800]   And all of their like dodging around it and making excuses made me very disappointed in them.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.280]   And I consider myself, you know, a part of the Apple ecosystem.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.880]   All right, Miss Apple ecosystem.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.280]   How do you feel about this?
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.840]   iOS 13, they're going to, and if you have the beta, you can try this already.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:51.440]   They're going to modify the FaceTime eye correction so that because you know,
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.720]   the problem with iPads and iPhones is you're not looking at the camera.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.840]   You're looking at a picture of yourself or your family member.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.480]   They're going to make it look like you're looking at the camera.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:08.400]   They're going to literally move your eyes so that Apple that you'll look like you're looking at.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:14.960]   In fact, here's a good video from Dave Schuchin who posted this on Twitter.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:17.440]   Watch the line as it distorts.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:21.440]   It's distorting because AR is moving his eyes.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:24.080]   He's not actually, if you look in the upper right hand corner,
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.320]   looking at the camera, he's looking down.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.400]   It looks like he's looking straight at you.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:34.720]   And you can see that his nose and eyes are getting repositioned by the software.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:35.680]   What do you think?
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:36.080]   Crazy?
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.520]   That is so cool.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:40.640]   I think it's creepy.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.840]   I have thoughts, but...
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.920]   Why aren't you ever taking your eyes off me, Leo?
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:44.960]   You're keep looking at me.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.080]   Is there something I should know?
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.640]   It looks like you're psychotic.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:57.360]   But wait, it only does that when you're looking at the small preview of the person you're talking.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.520]   Oh, it's smart enough to know what you're looking at.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.840]   I think maybe I got that part wrong.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.720]   That's what I think.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.360]   But if that's what it is...
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.680]   I never looked away from myself when I'm on a call, so I don't want to.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.240]   Yeah, me too.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:10.800]   I feel that way.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.280]   Me too.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.720]   It's because we're so good looking.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.160]   We just were...
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.520]   Oh my god, look how this...
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.160]   I look like this today.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.160]   I am so on fleek today.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.560]   Oh my god, that's fantastic.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.200]   Oh man.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:21.600]   Stop it.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.160]   We laugh.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.920]   It's hot enough and here as it is.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.920]   We just want to make you sweat.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.040]   Now just touch your nose and then I'll turn up the AC.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.280]   No, this...
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.800]   So here's my problem with this.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:39.600]   I noticed they were testing this feature before they...
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:39.920]   Yes.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.280]   And here's...
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.880]   Here people are going to be like, no, you didn't.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.280]   I swear to you, I didn't know what it was doing.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:51.920]   But my partner, I hate calls and I hate FaceTime and I hate phones up to my ear and I hate it all.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.440]   But my partner really likes to talk on FaceTime, really likes talking to them.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.400]   Is that always the case?
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.440]   There's one person who doesn't, one person who does.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.200]   I know somebody likes to text.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.640]   I like before it text.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.960]   They won't text or I like, yeah, it's always that way.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.040]   So I make the...
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.000]   This is always calling me.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.120]   So don't call me text me.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:09.760]   Right.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.640]   But I, you know, I'll talk to him on the phone and FaceTime with him because he's okay, I guess.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:20.880]   And so I'm in the car, not driving, I was in the passenger seat and he FaceTimed me.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.440]   And I'm looking at my eyes and my eyes look dead and weird.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.400]   That's what'll happen.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:26.800]   Yes.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.920]   Because they're not moving.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.520]   They look dead, they look weird.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.640]   I looked like I had a sharp...
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.920]   ...sleep in like nine days.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.520]   My mom was driving and I said, can you look at my eyes?
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.160]   Am I okay?
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.280]   Like, is everything okay?
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.040]   I had just gotten over Bell's palsy.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.880]   So I was genuinely concerned.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.160]   You're eyes are really moving in the past.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.320]   And so I was like, is there one eye move in the other one?
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.680]   One eye moves and the other one did.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.520]   It was my right side that was frozen.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.520]   So anyway, it kind of gave me a little freak out.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:56.000]   And this was before they added the switch to turn on and off correction, or the eye correction thing.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.640]   And so when that came and people started talking about it, I was like,
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.280]   oh, thank God, I'm glad I don't look like that.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   Because my eyes look so strange and dead and weird.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.760]   And so I think they're still ironing it out and figuring out how to AR move your eyes
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.840]   so that they don't seem dead like you're talking about.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.040]   Here's... I think it looks kind of creepy.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.960]   This is Will Sigman, who is an Apple guy.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.680]   Apple...
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.120]   That's the one that made me like it.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.040]   Because he looks... I mean, he is smiling in the altered version where he is made to be looking at the camera.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.480]   Yeah, the Verge piece.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.160]   And it definitely, for me, it makes it look like he's more engaged.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:34.560]   More content.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.040]   More connected.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.280]   I guess we should hide his...
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.400]   That being said, I had not seen it in motion as you did, Micah.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.680]   So I could be...
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.880]   Let me make this be more fair.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.320]   Wow!
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.600]   Let me give him a red beard.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.560]   Okay.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.320]   Now, who do you like more?
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.520]   Actually, I still like it more.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.480]   I'll just fix the cheeks.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:54.960]   It's cheesy.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.160]   That's a smile.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.720]   That's a smile.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.920]   I have to erase the smile lines.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.680]   This is...
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.480]   Just do the eyes.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.640]   I see why you use the surface.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.640]   Now you see why Microsoft...
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.040]   You think they have looked like a victim of the Joker.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.120]   Leo's making his first dream daddy, actually.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.320]   He's my dream daddy.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.240]   Hi, dream daddy.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.160]   Let's give you a little red mustache.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.320]   I'm sorry I had a dream daddy with a red mustache.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.360]   All right.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.000]   I'm sorry, Will.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.720]   I don't know you.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.400]   But I love you, man.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   We can FaceTime and look directly to each other's eyes.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.240]   I hope he watches.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:26.720]   I hope he's watching right now.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.320]   If he's watching, he's going on crap.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.480]   That was horribly creepy.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:39.280]   Actually, I think we should take a break.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:47.120]   Hey, it's so nice to have someone that we're roached for on.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.000]   Is that your real name?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.680]   It is my real name.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.800]   I was born with it.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.160]   You were named after blue cheese?
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.920]   That's Roach for.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.760]   And you said this was going to be a French theme podcast.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.360]   You don't even know Roach for cheese.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.120]   I just was in the mood for an omelet du fromage.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.600]   And don't look at me like that.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.360]   You can't bring that pre-show in joke.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.320]   Is that allowed?
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.000]   Yeah, pre-show in joke.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.040]   Alert.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.840]   Anyway, Simone, I don't know why we took so long to get you on your fantastic.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.800]   Thank you for being here.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.720]   She's a video producer at Polygon.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.800]   She is doomquasar on the Twitter and one of the three hosts on Rocket.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.160]   And do you do such a good job with the ads on Rocket?
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:36.720]   I was going to say after I heard your ad read, I thought that is so soothing.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.800]   That is the opposite of what I do.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.160]   Yeah, you do the opposite.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:46.080]   But your strategy might be smarter because your listeners aren't falling asleep when they hear the ads.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.600]   When you do that calm ad, I'm like, oh, man.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.280]   Oh, I always do the calm ad really calm.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.040]   Let's see.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.960]   Let's make you relaxed.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.720]   No, actually this one I should make you jittery because it's an ad for LastPass.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:04.480]   LastPass is the number one most preferred password manager, a one you must use.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.560]   We use it all the time.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.200]   I've been using LastPass since they came out, so it's been almost a decade.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:16.320]   And the nice thing is, look, I think everybody understands that passwords are the spawn of Satan.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.680]   They're the terribleest thing.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.800]   But you have to somehow authenticate yourself, right?
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.200]   You have to prove to that website or that app.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.240]   This is your account.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.440]   It's okay if you take money out or whatever.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.120]   So you got to have these passwords.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.760]   This is not anything the human brain was designed to do.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:37.280]   You know, when I was a kid, you didn't have to remember a thousand different passwords.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.840]   The most you'd have to remember is your locker combination, right?
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.280]   I mean, that's about it.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.440]   Your phone number, your home address.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.320]   That's it.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.000]   I could hold that in my mind.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.440]   Now, which is, by the way, why all my passwords are a combination of my locker
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.080]   combination, my home address, my phone number.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:52.720]   Because it's still--
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.520]   And what were they again?
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.960]   Well, it was 293642.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.560]   Never mind.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.200]   I don't use those anymore.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.120]   But for a long, I think a lot of people do that, right?
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.560]   I actually do use my childhood phone number in conjunction with other things in my
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.440]   master password.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.480]   Everybody take a note?
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.640]   You'll never guess my childhood phone number.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.000]   555.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.520]   555.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.240]   That's it.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.760]   But that's the problem is we have to come up with these strategies.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.920]   So LastPass is brilliant because you remember one password, your master password.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:31.680]   And then all the rest are long, completely non-memorable passwords generated by LastPass,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.240]   stored by LastPass encrypted.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.480]   So no one, not even LastPass has access to them.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.320]   They're only decrypted on device.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.360]   Make sure you have a good, strong master password.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.840]   And I always use two-factor authentication.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.280]   LastPass supports every kind of second-factor authentication.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.240]   I use a Yuba key.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:52.000]   So unless you have my keys, you're not going to be able to get my password
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:52.240]   for all.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.560]   I think that's a really great way to secure it.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:07:00.800]   We also use it in business because, you know, I have good password hygiene thanks to LastPass,
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:04.320]   but we want to make sure every one of our employees does because there are passwords.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.200]   They know the logins to the website, to the databases, to everything.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.800]   We've got to lock those down.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.480]   LastPass Enterprise keeps our passwords safe.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.480]   And LastPass has just introduced a new business lineup that I think is fantastic.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.120]   And you'll like this.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.720]   If you've been following security now or you understand the issues,
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.400]   you will really appreciate this.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.360]   First of all, LastPass Enterprise, the one we use has just introduced a single sign-on
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:32.800]   technology, SSO, and already supported by 1200+ apps.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.320]   So you can have a password, but you could also have single sign-on.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.600]   I love this, which manages every entry point with one solution.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.720]   Your employees will love it because they don't have to remember anything.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.000]   It's very straightforward, but it's more secure than a password.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.040]   So you'll love it too.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.760]   They also have LastPass MFA.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.120]   That goes beyond two-factor authentication, multi-factor.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:03.280]   It uses biometrics, geolocation, additional factors to make sure that those passwords
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.320]   are super safe.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.040]   Only the right users are getting the right data at the right time.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.800]   That's important in a business because we might have the, you know, the QuickBooks
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.840]   password in our vault, but we want to make sure only people who should have access to that
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.640]   are using it.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.400]   That is an additional factor.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.120]   I love it.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:25.040]   LastPass Identity combines Enterprise and MFA to give you a holistic view of end user activity
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.400]   from one dashboard that covers passwords, authentication, every app that's in use.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.840]   You see that, your IT department, your security, people see that.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.600]   From a single sign-on and password management to adaptive authentication,
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.120]   LastPass Identity shows you this is why we love LastPass.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.480]   They are on the front line of authentication and gives you granular control to IT,
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.200]   but also gives your users frictionless access.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.280]   So they're more likely to want to use it.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:55.360]   And I should tell you, Micah, that everybody who works at Twit gets a free LastPass account.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.360]   That's part of your employment.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.440]   I was wondering when I'd get the bank account details.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:08:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.160]   No.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:00.320]   No.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.120]   You don't get the passwords.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.120]   Just the last pass.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.280]   We are very excited about what LastPass is doing.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.320]   I think you will be too.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:12.000]   LastPass bridging the gap between access and authentication to simply and securely manage
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.560]   identity.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.160]   That's really what it's all about.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.960]   13 and a half million people use LastPass.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.600]   They love it.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.160]   They trust it.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:18.800]   You will too.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.440]   LastPass.com/Twit to see how LastPass can help you.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.880]   LastPass.com/Twit.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:30.080]   Thank you, LastPass, for securing, for covering our assets as it were.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:34.480]   Patrick Bejaw also here from frenchspin.com.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:35.920]   Not Patrick.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.360]   Always a pleasure.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.000]   Indeed.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.960]   You are doing both English and French language podcasts like Le Honde vous tec.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.520]   Le Honde vous je.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.640]   Le Honde vous je.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.120]   For gaming.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:47.600]   For gaming.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:47.920]   Je.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:47.920]   Je.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.560]   Not jure.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.040]   Je.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:49.600]   Je.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.160]   James.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:50.880]   I got it.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:51.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.000]   Nice.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:52.640]   Exactly.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.240]   And do you do, I want you to do a new podcast called Omele du Frémage.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:56.800]   We all do.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.360]   We do that.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.360]   That should be an amazing language teaching podcast.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.360]   I'm not to speak French.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.640]   So it's funny because you learned that from what?
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.200]   Dexter's lab on Cartoon Network.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.560]   And he falls asleep and he speaks French when he wakes up.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.720]   And all the girls love him for it.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.440]   All the teacher asks some questions and he just says,
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.720]   "Omele du Frémage."
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.440]   And the teacher's like, "Yes, that's the best answer.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.480]   You get an A."
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.320]   But Patrick tells us that's not...
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.320]   First of all, "I'm Le" is "Omelette."
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:26.800]   "Omelette."
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.480]   And it's not "Dew" it's "O."
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:28.880]   Oh.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.640]   So the only thing they got right was "Fermage."
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.720]   I mean, who can get cheese wrong, you know?
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.960]   (laughs)
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.680]   "Omelette O-Fermage" is how it should be said.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.840]   As I mentioned before the show started,
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.600]   I think every American person who wanted to make a joke
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.560]   when they heard I was French in my life has said some variation of...
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:48.960]   Really?
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:49.840]   "I do Frémage."
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.000]   No.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.200]   I'm so sorry.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.160]   I hope I didn't do that.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.080]   Oh man, this was my introduction to you.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:54.880]   I'm so sorry.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.440]   (laughs)
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.360]   That's just part of my childhood.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:57.520]   I know.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:57.760]   Just...
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.320]   Oh.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.080]   Horrible.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.280]   That means you're American.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.160]   That's all it means.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.040]   It's confirmed.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.160]   Everyone does it.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.400]   We talked about Johnny Ive leaving Apple.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.680]   There was a Wall Street Journal article about it
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.760]   that Tim Cook was affronted by.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.120]   And I can't think of very many times that Tim Cook A has been affronted.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.880]   And B has said anything public about this.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:25.360]   The article implied that Johnny left Apple
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.280]   because he was frustrated that Tim wasn't the visionary Steve was,
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.520]   that they lacked interest in design, that they didn't support his work.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.360]   This is the title of the article in the journal.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.560]   Johnny Ive is leaving Apple.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.840]   His departure started long ago and has a big picture of Johnny showing
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.920]   Tim something that Tim's been looking at on his desk for about eight months,
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.360]   which is the brand new Mac Pro.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.920]   And Tim feigning interest in it.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.600]   But I think he's feigning it quite well.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.400]   Tim was hurt.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.080]   Tim was hurt.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.360]   He wrote to a journalist at NBC,
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.760]   "Hi Dylan, hope you're well."
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.600]   I guess Dylan Biers had asked Tim Cook about this article.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.280]   The story is absurd.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.200]   A lot of the reporting, certainly the conclusions just don't match with reality.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:13.520]   At a base level, it shows a lack of understanding about how the design team works
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.480]   and how Apple works.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.760]   It distorts relationships, decisions, and events to the point.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.840]   We just don't recognize the company.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.120]   It claims to describe.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:26.480]   I can't think of a single time Tim Cook has been so pissed off.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.160]   I think this is a PR move.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.880]   He's not necessarily angry or maybe he is.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:39.680]   But the importance here is with Johnny Ive being the second of the greats of Apple,
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:43.840]   that defined Apple to not be at Apple anymore.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:49.040]   I think it was very important to not let that idea that it was a confrontation between the two
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.360]   that led to his departure.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:55.280]   Because if everyone starts saying, "Oh, he left because
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:00.960]   Cook doesn't care about design," it means Apple today doesn't care about design.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.320]   That's very bad news for Apple.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.200]   If that perception becomes common.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:14.480]   My suspicion would be that that was damage control before the narrative could take hold.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:21.840]   It wasn't just Johnny Ive who was being criticized or talked about in this
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.280]   piece rather that he was going away and being disillusioned.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:31.120]   Also, the fact that the team that worked under Johnny Ive felt like Johnny was always gone and
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.880]   not there to make decisions.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.000]   It wasn't just...
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.600]   That was demonstrably true though.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.200]   Everybody has heard that story.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.800]   Johnny set up...
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.480]   Instead of even going down to the campus, he had a place in San Francisco.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:47.120]   The team had to travel up to and twice a month they'd get to show him what they were working on.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.960]   That is not just the Wall Street Journal and that article.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.560]   That's been reported for years.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:59.440]   I think that that's important to talk about the fact that it's not just a war between Cook and
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:06.080]   Ive, but there's a bigger story here about Ive also wanting to step away and not do the same
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.280]   role that he had.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.880]   And those both add up.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:17.040]   The thing that really bums me out about all of this coverage is that by focusing so much attention
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:26.800]   and importance on this person we've put up on a perfect aluminium totem that he stands atop.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.200]   Thank you.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.240]   Thank you for that.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:28.880]   The...
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.600]   You're very welcome.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:30.640]   See, maybe I'm not a man.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.000]   You might say I'm a lady from Ojibri, but he does say aluminium correctly.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.360]   The problem with that is...
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.240]   It should be crazy.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.880]   We forget the teams that create these devices.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:41.520]   And...
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.240]   Absolutely.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:45.600]   It dishonors them to say, well it's just Johnny's gone.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.760]   As soon as Johnny's gone, nothing can do.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.680]   He doesn't sit down and do it all on his own.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:56.480]   However, you gotta say, and I'm actually cribbing this from John Gruber, but Jobs and I were the
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.920]   Lenin McCartney of Apple.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.960]   It isn't like Ringo and George did any great albums.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.320]   I mean, afterwards.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.080]   Unless you like Ringo, start his traveling.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:14.240]   No, I agree with you, but that's a band where you really are having this small group.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:14.800]   It's a small group.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.480]   And Apple's 20,000.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.360]   This is a huge team of people that are just, oh well, now that Johnny Ives gone,
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.640]   you all who've been working on all these products for so long can't do anything.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.320]   And that just really crumbles my gears, my aluminium gears.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:26.960]   That's a good point.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.600]   I don't think that's what people are saying.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.880]   I'm sorry, go on, Patrick.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.920]   No, please, please.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.560]   No, no, no.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.520]   Don't be the gentleman.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:37.200]   Patrick and then Simone.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:43.360]   I don't think people are saying that Apple can't do anything, and Apple themselves
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:51.360]   always puts the teams front and center to the annoyance of journalists that get their ears
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.040]   popped when they're at a show.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:16:00.800]   But I think there is some substance to the fact that some people are in design.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:06.000]   Some people are better than others.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.600]   And it's just like an artist.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.800]   You can't say that any artist can do the same as everyone else.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:20.240]   The concern with Johnny Ives leaving and Steve Jobs dying is warranted.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.600]   You had a unique thing.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.880]   I mean, that was really unique.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.800]   Go ahead, Simone.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:31.120]   I was just going to say, I think that part of why Tim Cook is so peeved and also something
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.160]   that rings true to me is that the article, both this one and Bloomberg's piece,
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:42.160]   talk about the design team kind of seeking out Johnny Ives approval, even as Alan Dye and Richard
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.880]   Howard were essentially running the day to day of the design team.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:53.520]   And it does ring true to me that because he is such a figurehead, it could derail production
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.440]   if people are constantly being like, well, we have to get Johnny's approval on this.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.600]   I don't consider these people are leaders.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.400]   I want his opinion, his sort of blessing on this decision.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.240]   I think that that could cause dissension in a team.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:11.600]   I can see that happening if he is, as you say, a Lenin-like figure.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.320]   Yeah, Mark German's got, you mentioned Bloomberg, Mark German's got excellent sources inside
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.120]   Apple.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.480]   And he essentially published the same story that Wall Street Journal did.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.000]   No, he's got the same sources.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.680]   They say he says the company's closeness design team withered in recent years.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.680]   On the other hand, I think there are a lot of people who see Johnny Ives,
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.520]   and I don't mean this facetiously, but departure as potentially good news,
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.640]   Apple has been so design focused for so long that they, I think they've kind of lagged behind
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.840]   maybe in technology.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.440]   And I think maybe a renewed focus.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.320]   Johnny was not a form follows function guy.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.200]   He was all about form, all about design.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.480]   Remember his Christmas tree?
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.760]   No.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.160]   There's no no decorations on this.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.840]   They asked him to do, I can't remember where it was.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.360]   They asked him to design a Christmas tree.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:01.520]   Yeah, it's a month.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:01.520]   It's a month.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.080]   It's a month.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.640]   There were no, there was nothing on this Christmas tree.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.560]   It had no ornaments.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.920]   His didn't like buttons and ports.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.040]   His toilet.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.680]   It was one slab of aluminium.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.880]   The Americans go crazy with ornaments on Christmas trees.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.080]   I mean, it's shocking when you don't know.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:27.520]   This is Johnny Ives Christmas tree in the lobby of Carriages.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.720]   You can't even see it.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.200]   It's dark.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.160]   It's a tree.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.520]   It's a dark nose.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.720]   It's a tree.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.760]   I take it back.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.480]   I was wrong.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.680]   I did get it back.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.280]   I mean, you see that, you look at it, you go,
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.960]   when are they going to put the decorations on?
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.920]   And what did he design?
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.040]   I don't understand how you designed.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.000]   Is that a living thing?
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.880]   It's a perfect.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:49.200]   It's a perfect reflection, a surprise of having it.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.000]   A tonic idea of a tenon balm.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.280]   There you go.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.320]   There you go.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.520]   So I see what you're saying there,
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.680]   where kind of like what the joke you made earlier about as soon as he walked out.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.240]   It's not just that one tree by the way, there's other trees.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.440]   They're just equally barren.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.040]   They literally just brought in a forest.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.520]   You imagine yourself in a forest instead of just going to a forest.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.920]   Oh, it's growing on me.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.880]   I like it.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.280]   Literally.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.640]   Ah, that's too high-pitched.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.160]   I'm starting to like it.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.360]   I'm starting to like it.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.680]   I think there is something there.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.440]   You can find those in nature.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.400]   I don't know.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.680]   But nature's perfect.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.720]   Why would you want to, uh...
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.240]   Well, that nature's dead now.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:32.880]   That nature's dead now.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.840]   I can't remember the name.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.200]   Burnhamwood to Dutsonane comes.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.560]   Yes.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.440]   He's brought Burnhamwood to the Cleridges lobby.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.760]   Which I think means that the true king of England is dead.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.400]   But I don't know.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.880]   I can't remember which is how they are.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.800]   All right.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:51.920]   Anyway, we're going to see.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.440]   New era at Apple perhaps.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.400]   What's the...
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.680]   Jeff Key Mechanisms.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.120]   Jeff Williams, who is...
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.920]   I think the other reason that Tim might have been peeved
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.600]   is that the design team now reports to the chief operating officer
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.880]   a man handpicked by Tim Cook to replace Tim Cook.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.280]   This was Tim Cook's old job COO.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.000]   He brought in Jeff Williams to replace himself.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.600]   Jeff is an operations guy.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.960]   And I think one of the reasons Cook might have been annoyed is that
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:17.920]   a lot of these stories said,
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.160]   "Well, how could an operations guy oversee design?"
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   He cooks like, "What do you mean?"
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:22.720]   "What do you mean?"
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.840]   So, in fact, there's the Wall Street Journal.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.040]   With Johnny, I have successor,
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.760]   Apple Betz, a pragmatist's intern prophet.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.280]   Does anybody...
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.120]   Okay, this might be a little controversial.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:39.360]   Does anybody really think that Apple's got any of that mojo left
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.960]   that it had under Jobs and I've...
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:43.680]   I'm not going first.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.200]   No, they don't.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:47.600]   They don't.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:51.440]   I think they're still a different company.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.080]   But it's been a while.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:58.880]   And I've been defending the idea that we need to wait for a few years
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.040]   because before we can decide what Apple is,
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:08.000]   the post Steve Jobs Apple is, and not bury them early.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:08.880]   Yeah, prematurely.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.840]   And I don't think...
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.320]   Yeah, that's fair.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.960]   And I don't think that they are very worthy.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.440]   They're just another company that has a
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.720]   focus on design because they're going to keep that
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.800]   in premium products and privacy now.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.880]   But I think they haven't...
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.960]   In order to make them the Apple of the Steve Jobs era,
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:38.080]   they need to be producing impactful products.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.000]   And while I love them,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.800]   the most impactful thing they've done in the past few years
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.400]   is the AirPods.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.440]   I really love them.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.560]   I think they're a brilliantly designed piece of hardware,
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.240]   but they're not impacting society,
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.600]   except you see them everywhere.
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.160]   But the last one was the iPad.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.280]   I don't think the Apple Watch rises to that level.
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.440]   It captured the market, but it didn't grow it.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.920]   So maybe it will change,
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.240]   and maybe they will have a product that will show us.
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.400]   They are still that significant.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:13.600]   But to this day, I think evidence shows that
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.400]   they're still a very cool company and different from
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.720]   Amazon and Google and Microsoft and all of them.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.240]   But I don't think they can be cool the same Apple
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.160]   that they were under Steve Jobs.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:26.080]   I don't disagree with that.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.440]   I quite like that.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.360]   And I think when you're talking about impacting society,
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.800]   there are different aspects of that.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.120]   Pop culturally, Apple has had a huge impact with AirPods
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.040]   because I can't scroll on Tumblr
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.360]   without some joke being made about AirPods.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.320]   You see them everywhere,
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.680]   and everybody's always talking about...
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.760]   You know, we haven't had them though, haven't we?
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.120]   Yeah, they're just kind of...
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.880]   I don't think you laugh at people anymore wearing AirPods.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.960]   Certainly not. No, in fact, it's kind of the opposite.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.880]   And that's fine.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.880]   And so there are different forms of impact that can take place.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.200]   And that form of just sort of being in the fabric of pop culture
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.080]   is an interesting thing.
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.120]   See, I don't care about that.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:03.600]   Change everybody.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.560]   See, I don't care about that.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:05.520]   I'm not interested in that.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.160]   I'm interested in anything.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.120]   We're not a game.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:07.760]   No, no, I'm not.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.720]   Are they going to innovate in technology?
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.200]   Are they going to find a new way to express technology that...
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.600]   You cannot argue that when the iPhone came out in 2007,
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:21.040]   that was a complete paradigm shift in the world.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.000]   We didn't know it at the time.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.200]   That's now...
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.600]   Everybody's carrying something very much like an iPhone,
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.880]   if it's not an iPhone,
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.120]   and staring at it all the time.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.120]   And there's so many technologies that came out of it.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.560]   This was transformative.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.080]   Their next chance is AR, I think.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:34.160]   And...
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:37.760]   Everyone's like, no!
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.080]   Still.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.160]   Maybe, maybe it's possible.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.360]   But the problem with AR is that they need a device.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.440]   You can't have AR be that impactful on the phones alone.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.440]   And it's hard to work on having it for the future.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.800]   So it's not hard.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.520]   You need a device and then you need content for that device,
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.280]   which I think has been the big challenge with AR and VR.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.160]   It's just finding the market, finding the right device,
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.280]   and then putting things on it so that people stay with the device.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.480]   Well, ironically, Apple's the worst position to do.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.760]   You made an excellent point, Shmoan,
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.960]   because I could see Apple designing beautiful spectacles
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.240]   that have all the works in it and give you a heads-up display.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:17.200]   But unlike Google, they won't have any information about the things
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.880]   you're looking at. Google has all that.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:19.760]   That's true.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.800]   So can Apple even make something without the data?
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.280]   That's fine.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.720]   The on-device.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.640]   Yeah, that's a very interesting point.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.360]   What can you talk about?
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.520]   Content-wise, they have done the best job.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.000]   Or at least they had the best plan.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.240]   I don't know how well it's going to turn out,
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:43.200]   because they did start their AR content farming with iOS devices.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:49.280]   And sure, it's not good now because, again, they need an actual device,
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:56.080]   but they have more knowledge on the developer community and an ecosystem
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.600]   than I think it's fair to say than any other AR platform.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.200]   Now, whether or not it amounts to something when they actually come out with it,
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.160]   it depends if AR is good for anything or not.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.080]   And that, I think the jury is still out on it.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.400]   That is a very good point.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.720]   And because they are the biggest mobile, like the home for developers on mobile,
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.720]   they do have access to that whole stable of people who are familiar with their tools.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.320]   So yeah, I think that's a good point that they could have an advantage there.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.680]   Here's the...
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:35.440]   Despite Apple's history of innovation after innovation, it's usually the case,
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:38.320]   it seems to me in technology, that if there's a real innovation going to happen,
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.720]   it's going to happen from a startup.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.600]   It's going to happen from not an incumbent because of the innovators dilemma.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.560]   And incumbents are invested in preserving their existing market.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:54.320]   Only Apple historically really has been able to do this kind of crazy thing where they go,
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.440]   "Yeah, we're going to destroy the iPod market because we're going to make the iPhone."
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.520]   And that's a hard thing for normal businesses to do.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.040]   I don't think Apple does that anymore.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.520]   I think Apple is preserving its incumbency and saying, "No, no, we're going to make more money
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.680]   per customer. That's how we're going to stay in business."
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.560]   It's not a unsuccessful strategy, but it doesn't lead to innovation.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:22.160]   Yeah, and they're late to making a smart speaker, and they're jumping into the TV content game
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:29.040]   in the year of peak TV. And those things don't necessarily... They're not necessarily signals of
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:34.960]   something dire happening, but it is just kind of following trends that have been established already
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:40.240]   for a while with Amazon Echo and Netflix and Amazon Prime existing.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.600]   We have too much TV already. Why are they getting into that now?
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.320]   Yeah, and I don't mean to say Apple's not successful. They are.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.800]   And I don't mean to say Apple's a bad company. They're no different than Google or Microsoft or
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:55.360]   any existing company because once you're an incumbent, once you're that big, it's hard to do
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.960]   anything innovative. I wonder, though, if the big tech companies are so dominant at this point
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.040]   that it's going to be hard for some little guy to come along and say, "I'm going to create AIDAR."
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.760]   They always get acquired. Yeah, there's so many
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:13.200]   Magic Leap and companies like that where they say, "Well, we've got this great technology,
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.600]   but they don't... Maybe they'll get acquired? I don't know." It feels like it's a different
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.160]   world than it was when Apple invented the iPhone. And I don't know who's going to invent the next
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:28.400]   big thing or where it's going to come from. I think that's a fair concern.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:32.800]   Because you do want those things, right? Yeah, absolutely. You want those game changers.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:38.640]   Yeah, and that's where it's kind of a positive and a negative because sometimes when those big
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.760]   companies do gobble up these small companies, the companies are good stewards, but that's a
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.400]   more rare thing to happen. And they kill the innovation. Exactly. It becomes part of it.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:55.840]   But that's... Earlier, I had mentioned that when I see Apple's next chance in innovating is an AR,
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.360]   I see that as still down the line. If we look at what Apple's doing right now,
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.000]   which we've got TV, we've got this, those are not places where they have an opportunity to innovate.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.520]   But augmented reality is not here yet. I feel we were talking... Patrick, you had mentioned,
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:18.320]   it's not here until we have the hardware and that kind of thing. And so if I see Apple figuring
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.960]   out another place to innovate, that's where I see it happening. And again, I know I talk about
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:29.920]   those earnings calls a lot, but I do think that there are threads of a narrative that come to
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:35.280]   exist in those earnings reports. And Tim Cook, before they were talking services services,
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:42.480]   services, every single earnings call, he loved to talk about AR. And right now, yeah, it's not great.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:48.000]   It is buggy. It's just talking about AR every single call. And that's why I think that...
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.920]   Did he stop in the last call? He has in the last call because services services services.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:57.440]   But... Well, that's a good point. I think that we have to look at that and see that maybe this is
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:01.680]   where they're pushing their next big bet, but they're also making sure that they're covering
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:08.320]   their assets with these other things as well, where they can be in the smart speaker market,
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:14.480]   and you can pull my home pod and they can be in these music and stuff. But the next time they make
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.400]   a change that actually impacts, I wonder if they're looking to AR for that. You know who would I
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:26.160]   would say, because the innovator these days would be Tesla. But they're running up against a buzz saw
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:32.960]   of all these other big car companies. The big car companies made. And they created the electric
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:37.920]   car category. They made it acceptable. They made it positive. But it's going to be all these other
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.080]   companies that are going to make all the money off of it. Yeah. It's kind of... I wonder if the
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:45.600]   world has changed a little bit. There is, and we're going to take a break, but there is a company
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:54.480]   that on last this past Friday celebrated 25 years that maybe the one big incumbent that could change
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.160]   the world, but we're not going to tell you that is. Think about it. 25 years old. Think about it. Who
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:03.440]   could that be? But before while you're thinking, let's show you a little movie we made. I think John
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:08.320]   made it this week. We last got our editors to make little movies showing some of the best things
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:13.280]   you missed if you missed anything this week on Twitch. Watch previously on Twitch. Ladies and
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:20.240]   gentlemen, I introduce you to our newest Twitter host, Micah Sargent. Yeah, my God. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:28.240]   I feel bad because Micah is in Missouri right now, and all your family is in Missouri, but we're
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.120]   all in there. They're going to allow us to steal you away. But we're thrilled. I couldn't be more
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.800]   thrilled. Hands on tech. The cameras and video capabilities of modern smartphones are pretty
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:45.840]   awesome right now. So I went to Mountain View packing my Google Pixel 3 XL and the Sure MV88+
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.000]   video kit. Let me tell you, this kit is made for portability.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:57.840]   Mapquake Weekly. This weekend was the 12th anniversary of the shipping of the first iPhone.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.400]   Younger people have never used iPhone. If you have a friend who has one in a drawer, I can't
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:08.320]   recommend highly enough. You charge it up and say, "Wow, the screen is so rough."
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:14.480]   Windows Weekly. There were some more things testers in the fast-ring can do with your phone on
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:23.440]   Android. It's still working on it. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I want to play Mary Potter on my surface
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:32.000]   go, and now I can. Twitch. I got your touch surface right here. By the way, it did not play well at all.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:37.120]   I'm sorry to say, "Serve's go. I'm sticking with the phone." Our show today brought to you.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:42.320]   You might notice I'm very well rested. You noticed that? Yeah, I did. It makes you look younger.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:50.240]   You get that Dewey fresh expression? I'm actually 94. I'm 108 years old. But thanks to Casper,
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:56.720]   I only look like I'm 70. It's an amazing thing. Our Casper mattress, we love it. Casper is an
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:01.920]   incredible online retailer. Premium mattresses, they really invented this for a fraction of the
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:07.440]   cost. The folks at Casper realized there is a big inefficiency in the mattress market, and that's
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:13.920]   the mattress showroom. They take half the profit. They have to have the price of the mattress. They
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:18.000]   literally double the price so that you can go and live on a mattress for 10 minutes in the bright
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.480]   daylight in the showroom to choose it. No, that's nuts. Casper said, "Could we sell mattresses directly
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:32.960]   to customers cutting a lot of the cost of a middleman out?" Yes, they can because they give you 100
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:37.520]   nights to try it. You don't have to try to show them. You have 100 nights to lie on your Casper
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:42.800]   mattress. If for any reason you want to send it back, they'll come and get it. By the way,
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.280]   look at that box. It comes in the most compact box. You're going to say, "But how did I get it
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:51.360]   back in that box?" No, you don't have to save the box. They'll come and get it, and they'll give
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:56.240]   you every penny back. Here's a... We just got the new Casper, the hybrid mattress collection.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:02.000]   Here I am in my jammies opening it up because as soon as the Casper is out of the box, I want to
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.760]   lie on it. I love these Casper mattresses. They have created so many new technologies,
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:12.400]   bedding, bed frames as that glow light I showed you. This is the hybrid mattress collection,
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.400]   and I like it because it combines the pressure relief of their award-winning foam mattresses,
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:20.240]   but it has springs. I know you're going to say, "Wait a minute, springs? You watch."
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:25.360]   "Boying springs." I'll tell you why you want springs. First of all, it still fits in that
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:32.800]   compact box, but the springs give you elevated lift, active support, and durability for all body types.
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:37.840]   Increased airflow within the spring network so that they sleep cool. Caspers have always sleep
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:42.240]   up cool, and that's important. Sleeping cool is really important to having a good night's sleep.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:47.600]   Does that look comfortable? Then you see, I'm not a small man. I'm not a little man.
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:54.080]   When I get out of some beds, the mattress compresses to the degree that I fall out.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:00.160]   The enhanced edge support in these new Casper mattresses give you a firmer perimeter,
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.560]   and it makes a huge difference. I love our new Casper mattress. You will too.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:13.200]   Comfortable, soft, free delivery, painless returns in the US and Canada, a 100-night risk-free sleep
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:18.400]   on a trial, and still it comes in that small box, which is great because you can get it up the
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:24.560]   stairs into your little apartment in Manhattan simply and easily. I just love Casper. Get a

[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:59.280]   Foundation. You have more. Yeah, the Casper bed frame, the Casper sheets. Oh, my God, I love it.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.040]   Oh, you know what I love? In fact, I ask Lisa for it every night as my Casper pillow.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:06.800]   Have you ever had a Casper pillow? Yeah, I've got two Casper pillows. I got the king,
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:14.000]   and it's like a body pillow. I wrap myself around it, and Lisa likes soft, flat pillows.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.560]   Oh, no. I don't like flat ones. I don't want a flat pillow. She wants them to be flat, so I always,
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.800]   and I say, "Lisa, you have my pillow," but I notice she often has it, so I'm going to leave my pillow.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:27.840]   That's my Casper. That's that one's mine. I've been doing stealth advertising for Casper
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:35.360]   this entire podcast. I noticed. I noticed. Oh, thank you. I'm so cold, I made bed. I'll have you
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.440]   know I don't sleep with sheets, because it's 90 degrees here. You don't sleep with sheets?
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:47.120]   No. That's very European. Well, also top sheets are a lie from Satan as well. What? Oh, yeah, top sheets.
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:52.560]   So that's the new thing now. You go to a hotel, and they just have a feather.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:02.640]   Yeah. You lay it with a big feather. No, it's a feather blanket with a wrap duvet on it.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:07.200]   Mm-hmm. Duvet with a duvet cover. And no sheet. What is it? Duvet with a duvet cover.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.240]   Can you be my daddy?
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:17.360]   Duvet. I gotta go. Duvet cover. Oh, my God. Duvet with a duvet.
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.480]   So, wait a minute. I thought the cover was the duvet. The whole thing is a duvet.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.840]   The duvet is the thing inside. You put a duvet cover over the top of it.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:27.840]   And no sheet. No. What do they take the duvet cover of washing every day?
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.800]   Yeah. Yeah. So you can keep the duvet for a lot longer on your bed, and you don't have to wash
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:38.000]   it so much so it doesn't wear out, which is nice. Is that what you do, Simone? I mean, uh...
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:44.160]   Remember no covers. You don't have any covers. You sleep naked on the bed, because it's so hot.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:46.080]   Don't call me out like this.
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:53.040]   I like top sheets, and I think it's weird and perverse not to have a top sheet.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:58.160]   I don't understand it. Top sheets. Is that an age thing? It might be. There's like a website devoted
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.560]   to calling out the French. The French don't even use pillows. That's true. I heard that.
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:07.360]   What? You know, that is foul. They sleep on Appleware's T-vowo-mups.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:14.240]   First time I went to Paris, admittedly, this was 1967. They had a bolster, which is this round...
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:19.760]   It's like a cushion you'd find on a sofa, round cushion. I couldn't sleep the whole time I was in
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:24.240]   France, but I was admittedly, I was 11 years old. But you've gotten rid of that?
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.120]   There you go. What? Throw your top sheets. In town and country, it's time to say goodbye to top
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:34.720]   sheets for good. What? So what are top sheets? Oh, you don't even know, because you're French.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:41.920]   It's just a sheet. It's a thing Americans invented for sanitation. It's a thing that Americans invented
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.360]   to get you to spend more money on sheets. It's a bottom sheet that's on the mattress,
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:52.320]   and there's a top sheet that's above you. So you are sheathed in sheets, and then is bedding,
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:56.560]   and the blankets are separate. It's just a sweaty, nasty mess.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:00.720]   Bedding and blankets are separate, but you don't...
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:09.920]   Well, yeah. Okay. It's a comforter. The comforter goes, or as we say in France, a duvet.
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.680]   Apparently not. He calls out a comforter. This weekend tech, we try to figure out how beds work.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:18.880]   There's a comforter, and then there's a top sheet, and then there's a Leo, and then there's a sheet
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:24.640]   underneath. I'm like a Leo sandwich with sheets. For me, it's a sheet on the bed. It's basically...
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.280]   Sheet on the... Sheet on the... Sheet on the... Sheet on the... Sheet on the... Sheet on the... Sheet on the...
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.200]   And then a mica and a cute dog. Like an open-faced mica. An open-faced mica with two dogs,
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:35.040]   and then a duvet with no top sheet. You get all tied up in it. You're trying to pull it up.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:40.000]   You get hot, because it's way too many blankets. You're insulated. Your feet are trapped in there.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.400]   Your feet are trapped in there. It's all wrong. You don't have to tuck them in. Anyway,
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:54.400]   do we have an on? 25 years ago. July 5th, 1994, Jeff Bezos went to the
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:01.440]   business office wherever you do this and filed to create amazon.com. This is a really nice
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:08.240]   BBC piece on the 25th anniversary of Amazon to show how successful they've been. And I have to say,
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:13.840]   if there's going to be a company that's going to innovate, even though it's big and successful,
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:19.440]   Jeff has managed to keep Amazon nimble. And you look at the Echo, which I don't think anybody
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:24.720]   thought the Echo was going anywhere. I even think Jeff didn't. It was like it was like,
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:30.640]   very famously Amazon Web Services. Bezos said, "Well, I still don't think that your Echo is going
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.280]   anywhere." Really? I think it's going to explode at some point and people are going to realize it's
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:41.840]   completely useless. I think it created a category just as much as the iPhone created a category
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.200]   that we will look back on and say, "Oh, yeah, that's when that all that voice thing is heard."
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:50.960]   I know I'm alone. I don't like it and I don't use it. So I base all of my analysis on my--
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.920]   That's what I'm talking about. We've got to be-- Well, there are a lot of conscientious
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.400]   ejectors to the Echo because you don't want something with a microphone in your house.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:06.320]   In fact, we just learned that Amazon never throws out those Echo recordings unless you
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.680]   explicitly tell it to. I don't know. That doesn't bother me. Well, I think that's not a good look.
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:19.840]   Nothing but a jeez. That just ain't it, Sis. And by Sis, I mean Jeff Bezos. I think that
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:28.240]   a lot of people that I know that have echoes my mom, my grandma. Us older people like it.
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:34.080]   My-- Well, even my partner does not care about the privacy thing. Like, "Oh, it is keeping those--"
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.920]   It's just not a problem. To be clear, I don't care because I don't believe that it's recording
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.880]   everything. And here's this only recording stuff after I say the trigger word. We know that that's
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:49.040]   how it's supposed to work anyway. I don't have a problem with it having 100 recordings of me saying
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:56.480]   "Play Britney Spears." No, yours goes, "Hey, buy me a top sheet," is what yours says over here.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.800]   Echo, what's it do, Vay?
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:08.960]   Omelet du Fage. Echo, I want an Omelet du Fermage. And she never gets that one. She doesn't understand.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.200]   Never gets that. Weird. I think what bugs me about it--
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:17.200]   And obviously, it's not recording everything, as you said. But what bugs me about it is it's just
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:23.200]   one of those intrinsic things that is so easy to accept because you have to make the effort to
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.320]   tell it not to keep your recordings. It's so easy to accept. And they are using that data to
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.800]   eventually make money off us in the future. But they're not. To what? Like big brothers say,
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:40.880]   "Oh, when 1998 you said I hate the government, take it all down." No, no, purely on a monetary
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:45.120]   basis. Yeah, they're selling it. All of the information, all of the information about where I go,
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:51.120]   what I'm looking up, what I am interested in buying can be used to sell stuff to me. And
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:56.320]   it's impossible to avoid. I get that. But that's part of the reason that I don't have an echo
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:02.720]   is because I don't want to opt into the commodification of my existence.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:07.120]   Which is totally-- That's totally fair. Wait a minute. Whoa, that was a phrase.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.640]   I liked that. The commodification of my existence.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.440]   Just off the top of the dome there. Wow. Press that nose again.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:17.920]   Yeah. And you're just coming up with us and saying-- That heat isn't even bothering you.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:23.280]   Wait, wait, wait. I actually press my nose to record myself. And I never totally chose recordings.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:31.600]   I think-- Okay, remember the movie She. Was it She or Her? Her. Her. Her.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:39.280]   So he-- What's his name? Joaquin Phoenix. Joaquin Phoenix has a little earpiece
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:43.840]   and Scarlett Johansson, but it's not. It's an AI. It sounds like Scarlett Johansson.
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.920]   But I imagine they will in 30 years or whatever.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:56.160]   Totally real. They're getting very close. Totally hot. She's super hot. But she also knows
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:02.800]   everything. And he can say like, "Well, go through all my email and tell me." And she can do it like
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:10.480]   that so fast. I think that sounds great. Yeah. I do. Yes, of course. That's not what is though.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:16.640]   No, but it's that. It's always a word. It's no more that than the Atari video game system,
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:23.600]   Pitfall and the video game system was Fortnite. But you have to start somewhere. Sure. Sure.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:29.760]   But that movie isn't the more truthful look at how our future would actually look at the
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.640]   spoiler. Well, not the spoiler, but if you haven't seen it, watch it and stop this recording right
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:38.480]   now, watch it, and then come back because I'm going to spoil it. Okay. Actually, if you start this
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:43.200]   recording. I haven't seen it. Someone you have to watch. No, no, I'm not going to do any spoilers
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:50.880]   here. All I'm saying is it's not a movie that involves the truthful nature of what our existence
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:54.880]   would look like with that, where there would be ads served as science fiction. Yeah. And that
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:59.440]   movie is like, it's not about ads being shown to us because it can go through our email and stuff.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:04.880]   And so for us, I do like that future. And I like the idea of being able to have those different
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:12.080]   but you can't have that right unless you have you have you have the movie would lead us to believe
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:15.840]   that you can without without without talking. They don't talk. They don't write. That's yeah,
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:21.040]   that's kind of what I'm getting at is that movie gives a really positive, at least at first. Anyway,
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:26.880]   I'm no spoilers. That's that's absolutely true. But I think you can have data. The problem is not
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:33.920]   data collection. The problem is data sharing. So if you have a thing that allows you to keep the
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:41.120]   data in a place that you trust, you might have hacks and etc, etc. But that would not necessarily
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:48.000]   you know what it doesn't even matter if an AI does what her does in her. No one will care.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.920]   Everyone will just use it data collection. I think we're already that I think frankly,
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:57.120]   Patrick, we're already there. That's the point is that we get such value out of it that people
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:04.000]   are just whether willfully blindly or ignorantly. I don't know but pretending it's not happening.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.560]   I just Sam I will submit who's our car guy was just on the radio show showing me the interface
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:16.640]   that GM and others are going to put on your car soon that will have an
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:20.560]   hugely valuable for instance, the data of parking spots nearby. And you could say,
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:24.160]   where's a parking space and then and then it'll say, okay, turn left here.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:31.040]   Oh, that sounds great. Without adding the fact that probably some parking people will pay money
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:36.960]   to be the first on that list. It'll also have a it there's a Starbucks button and you can
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:42.160]   you can press you could say, where's the nearest Starbucks and make sure my drink is ready and
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:47.120]   knows your drink and it'll be ready there. All of that sounds like a convenience. All of it is
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:55.120]   advertising driven and revenue for the car company. Right. It's in and it's it's inextricable and
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:03.440]   it's coming because your car with GM on star or with my Tesla, these are always on connections
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.600]   to the internet knows where you are at all times. You know, when I first got the Tesla, I thought
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:10.720]   it was going forward when it should be going backwards. I called them up and they said, well,
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:14.640]   when did that happen? Oh, yeah, let's look at the log. No, no, you were in reverse.
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:22.320]   Like they know everything that happened moment by moment. And you know what? I don't mind.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:32.400]   Oh, man, when I think that that's so fascinating. Returning to the parking space example is that
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:39.280]   that can the fact that technology and how much money a company puts into that technology can
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:44.240]   change how we perceive reality. Because if the app is telling me, yeah, here's this parking space.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:49.440]   It's free. This you maybe it's the only one. You don't necessarily question that in the moment
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.440]   that you're looking for a parking space with the app is telling you that's nuts.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:59.280]   Well, and let me point out as Sam did that huge amounts of gasoline are wasted every year for
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.640]   people circle. You live in Manhattan. If you had a car, which I'm sure you don't,
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:09.760]   you'd be nuts. Not. But if you live in San Francisco with a car, you spend more time driving around
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:15.120]   looking for parking than you do a going somewhere. And so this will be a benefit for the environment.
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:20.320]   It will save everybody huge amounts of time. We're all going to be happier. And you know,
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:25.920]   the other thing this comes out of is the information sharing that you didn't like so much, Patrick,
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:30.800]   because we've seen how poorly it works. For instance, many municipalities that know in the
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.080]   subways coming or they know when the bus is coming, they know they have all this data. And they should
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:41.200]   because it's their governments that would be pay for them that taxpayers, they should share that
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:45.760]   data, but they have notoriously turned that data off to things like Google Maps and CityMapper,
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:51.360]   because they want to make money on their own New York City subway system application.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:58.000]   We want them to share data. Sharing data makes this stuff more useful. So this is the problem.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.480]   Yes, absolutely. There's this massive conflict between what you want as a private person.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:06.720]   And what you want as a consumer of technology.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:13.840]   And I don't think it can be reconciled, honestly. I think in a lot of the feelings of
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:19.680]   ambivalence that ordinary people have when it comes to security, I think comes from the fact that
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:25.600]   it's too late for us to be secure in any real sense. Because when we all first got online,
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:31.440]   we were like, "Whoo, whatever, set up accounts, I don't know what a password is." So I think for
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:38.640]   many of us, especially young people like me, it's too late for me to ever have true control
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:41.680]   over my identity online. Mark Zuckerberg already knows everything.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:46.480]   It was done. Yeah. Extremely online, as they say. But even if you're not young, even if you're old,
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:50.080]   when I first got online, I shared everything. I still share everything.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:53.600]   Yeah, you had the thing that tweeted when you were on your way to work or whatever,
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:56.640]   over when you were arriving in the office. Oh, Leo. I had the little...
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:59.840]   Stalkers are going to nab you. Oh, no. I hope they wish they would.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:06.960]   I had a little automatic, the thing that goes in the OBD2 port, and it would tweet when I was
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.360]   arriving at work. Scares me after that. Why? Why did you do that?
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:15.600]   I have... Well, the funny thing, I've told this story before, I apologize, but you guys haven't heard.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:22.320]   In 2015, I had a YThings internet connected scale, and I set up a Twitter account for it. So
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:26.800]   whenever I weighed myself, it tweeted my weight. I thought that would help me lose weight. It didn't.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:30.960]   But the funny thing is, and then I stopped using it and nothing happened.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:34.080]   The other day, I'm talking to somebody, she says, "Congratulations on your weight loss." I said,
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:41.840]   "How do you know about that?" She said, "You just tweeted it." I had set this up five years ago,
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.480]   stopped using it, bought another YThings scale like a couple of months ago.
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:51.440]   That was a new one? It was a brand new scale and blood pressure monitor. It logged into my account,
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:56.880]   and started retweeting my blood pressure in my weight. Oh my god.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:02.880]   That's the thing. Welcome to the quantified life.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:08.640]   That's... I think, Simone, I have to say, I feel really good about the fact that you and I were
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:15.040]   particularly freaking out about this, because I do think that that gives some sense of perspective
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:21.120]   to maybe how we are having a little bit of a turn back, where we're paying a little bit more
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:26.560]   attention to privacy. What are we going to do? Hey, I'm not paid to fix it. I just got to worry about it.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:32.320]   We're making common generation. Yeah, you're general. Stop climate change.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:35.520]   Stop climate change as you get into your Hummer and drive it.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:38.480]   All right, I got answers for that. We don't even have cars.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:48.160]   The sad reality of this problem is that if the companies are not going to be making money with
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:56.080]   your data, then you need to pay the product more. That means you are creating another digital divide
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:01.440]   between the people who can pay for these things, who can't. That's pretty terrifying.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:06.800]   The US Congress has asked Facebook to hold off on its
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:12.240]   coin, its Libra coin, its cryptocurrency, which of course Facebook's going to say,
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:16.560]   what did you say? I'm sorry, what? Sorry? Did you hear the tech support in Congress again?
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:24.400]   What? But somebody pointed out that this coin is not aimed at the US. This coin is aimed
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:29.840]   at countries where they don't have robust banking systems. People can't afford banking.
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:37.520]   The opinion we have in the US about Facebook is not necessarily held worldwide. It will also be
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:42.720]   popular in countries where Facebook is the Internet, which is AOL was the Internet.
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:48.800]   I don't know that I would have a hard time finding a country where Facebook is beloved.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:56.640]   Are they hated and false? Oh, yeah, they're hated everywhere. They're held responsible for
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:03.040]   old yields of the world pretty much everywhere. Maybe in India, it's more what's that?
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:07.360]   In India, they were bad. One of the reasons that Internet org didn't work in India
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:11.520]   is because the Indians saw it as colonialism. They said, no, we have private experience
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:14.880]   with a Raj. We don't want a new Raj in Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:19.440]   They said, we want the real Internet. Thank you. Yeah, we'll take the full thing. Thank you.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:30.480]   And the thing though is that it is an American company still. So I think I'm guessing that
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:36.800]   the US does have some kind of jurisdiction there. Maybe not the right to tell the way to say it.
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:42.080]   And the Libra would affect the US even if it's a good effect every country in the world and
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:46.640]   every bank in the world. That's why they hate it. But I got to point out that Facebook only
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:52.640]   contributed the technology to a Swiss holding company that Facebook and a hundred other companies
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:58.560]   are members of. So Facebook preserved plausible deniability. So what they're going to tell Congress
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:05.040]   is, oh, that's not ours. Wow. Even though it is still theirs, they're going to hand it over at the
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:11.200]   end of 2020. Right? Yeah, it's or 20. Yeah, I think it's they invented it. And they created this
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:18.240]   cleverly, I thought Swiss. Yes, very smartly. Yeah. And if anything, I think it's probably the best
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:23.120]   that Facebook comes up with something that can work out in the crypto space, because at least you
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:28.880]   have, you know, Facebook or the Libra Association, you have someone to talk to. If it's completely
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:33.360]   decentralized and, you know, the way that crypto currencies have been going for the most part.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:41.520]   And one actually takes off. You have no one to talk to, no one to actually ask what the hell is going
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:46.640]   on. I think, you know, Facebook is probably the best worst case scenario you can hope for in this,
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:52.960]   in this, you know, with this technology. All right, I'm going to give you trust in them is in the floor.
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:57.040]   Yeah, I know. Are you still on Facebook, though, Simone?
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:06.320]   Unfortunately, yes. So that's a perfect example of we know, but we put up with it because whatever
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:12.240]   whatever the benefits. Yeah, because my dang mom posts photos of me as a kid every year for my
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:17.520]   birthday. And I want to see them. It's all your mom's fault. All my mom's fault.
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:26.960]   So at works out, who would you rather have as the creator Facebook, which is a company?
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:32.560]   No, that I have a good solution. Right. Because what I don't like about this is that it's Facebook
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:40.240]   and a bunch of already powerful institutions doing like an end run around a financial system that
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:48.080]   is imperfect, but still does involve consumer protection and has been built to in some ways
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.520]   consider consumer protection. And I just don't think that Facebook has ever had consumers'
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:58.400]   best interests or safety at heart. So that's why I don't like to see it.
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:03.120]   I think they have a different worldview. It may not be a worldview we support, but they
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:09.280]   they have a work mark has a worldview that it's that nothing should be secret. Nothing should be
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:14.000]   private that will all be better off if we all just know everything about everybody. It certainly
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.560]   helps his bottom line. Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to separate his financial measures.
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:21.680]   I don't think he's learned his lesson.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:25.600]   I think he's shifting back towards privacy. That's right. I mean, didn't they have that whole
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.520]   you know, but yeah, he published a big post and we're going to go end to end encrypted.
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.160]   So all right, I really want to scare you now because remember, Elon Musk is putting up with
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:39.840]   Starlink 12,000 low-Earth orbit satellites. Amazon has just applied for permission
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:50.400]   to launch its own internet satellites, thousands of satellites in the sky, 3,236 satellites.
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:56.400]   Basically, the sky is going to be covered by big corporations.
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:02.800]   And then I just read an article, I think it was an MIT technology review that we're not sure,
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:06.640]   but satellite technology satellite camera technology has gotten so good. Oh, good.
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:13.360]   That it's very likely we certainly don't know what the military is capable of, but it's very
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:20.000]   likely that the technology exists for them to see everything that's going on. If you're outside,
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:26.560]   oh boy, smile, if you're outside. Now, I don't know if they're going to put cameras in these big
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:34.960]   satellites, but they say they're not. Who can really know? Who can say? Maybe you don't need
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:40.320]   cameras. Maybe you really learn enough from people by what they do on the internet. Yeah,
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:46.080]   you connect that. That is a very good point. But it's a different word. No.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:53.280]   If the word is that people know where you are, etc, it's not the same if they can actually
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:57:00.560]   physically see you any time of day anywhere. That's a very primal, visceral
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:08.320]   privacy concern, which is very... I can guarantee you, if you ask people, oh, well, do you care that
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:14.000]   Facebook knows everything you do? They'll say, whatever. If you ask them, do you care that they
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.440]   can actually see you from the sky? I'm sure about that. At that point, they're going to be like,
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:22.800]   oh, okay, that I don't like it. I think this is going to be... We're just going to eventually
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.200]   just become in your tool. It's just going to be so ubiquitous that we'll just go, well,
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.920]   what are you going to do? I remember first showing my... I think Facebook...
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:34.880]   Go ahead, Simone. Yeah, Facebook is the first step of that, I think. It's the frog in the pot of
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:39.920]   boiling water scenario where, as you said, as you said, Patrick, sharing stuff on Facebook,
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:45.520]   they know everything I do, whatever. The gradual progression of that over time, I think, will be,
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:50.000]   oh, God, they're watching me through the satellite cameras, but what can I do about it?
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.600]   Yeah, I want to kiss you, so let's go in. Let's go inside. It's safe. Well, they're going to have
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:58:01.440]   cameras inside too. Oh, crap. There already are cameras inside. I've got an echo spot in the bathroom.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:04.480]   There you are. Lasted has come on. Yes, you're saying about the echoes.
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:10.320]   It was hysterical on Wednesday. Facebook had an image outage. So if you were on Facebook,
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.960]   you didn't see the image, but what you would see is the alt tag associated with the image,
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:21.600]   which would tell you what Facebook's AI had tagged your photos with. Now, you would think this would be a
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:29.280]   big eye opener for people. One guy tweeted, "Facebook... I forgot Facebook uses machine learning to tag
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:34.320]   our photos with what it sees in the picture. To be fair, one person, beard, is pretty much a spot
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:46.720]   on description of me. Your profile photo may contain one person beard, but for some people,
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:56.960]   it was the AI just tagged my profile picture as basic. Oh, basic. Ouch. Oh, default, exactly.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:03.600]   Well, okay, so in terms of accessibility, I think this is fantastic. Instagram, not too terribly long
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:10.240]   ago, launched image descriptions, but shortly after launching image descriptions, which serves as alt
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:19.280]   text, they said that photos on Instagram would also be AI tagged as well. And so for that reason,
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:23.200]   I think that features like this are great, and I don't think that this is scary. For blind people,
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:27.360]   this is huge because you can at least get some idea of what you're missing. What is in the photo,
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:32.960]   exactly? For instance, here in a picture of Ruben with six other people indoors.
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:39.840]   You know, it's just six people. We should describe what the photo is. Well, it's the last supper,
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:44.240]   and actually there's seven people. So he says, "Facebook's broken AI photo recognition left one
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:52.880]   person out. It's either me or Judas." Facebook knows what Judas did. You and six people. I love it.
[01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:59.600]   Yeah, I love stuff like this for the same reason I like going into Facebook settings and looking at
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:05.200]   all the ad suggestions that they generate for me. Because there are two usually in the
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:08.960]   think. Do you think that's disinformation that they're making them bad on purpose?
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:15.040]   That's a good question. I want to thank Ain for coming. I have a very long-time
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:17.920]   discussion. Because then you would velvet shorts that I want.
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:26.400]   It actually says, "Next is Simone de Roche for Velvet Shorts." I actually did an experiment. I
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:33.520]   tweeted, "I wish I really don't want Facebook to advertise affordable velvet shirts to me. I would
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:38.160]   hate to see cheap velvet shirts all over my head." And did you? And eventually I did.
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:45.360]   I kind of love that. I'm glad to know such a thing exists. I could use an affordable velvet shirt.
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:52.400]   Yes. Let's take a break. I got an ad for you that I bet you've never done on rockets.
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:01:01.040]   Tell me. But I bet you you supported. You know that guys are terrible taking care of their health.
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:07.840]   When we're kids, we're taught when you're playing baseball, the coach says, "You
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:13.360]   didn't get hit by the ball." They said, "Just rub some dirt on it." But the coach, I think I have a
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:19.840]   concussion. Just rub some dirt on it. We taught from a youth to ignore injury that it's manly to
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:24.960]   go with the doctors like nobody wants to go to the doctor. In fact, that's why men with spouses
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:31.920]   live longer. Literally, I'm convinced because the wife says, or the spouse says, "Would you please
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:36.960]   go to the doctor that you've been coughing for six months? Please go to the right?" Yeah.
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:43.360]   Well, the same is true for ED. The rectile dysfunction. 70% of guys who experience ED,
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:50.160]   they just kind of live with it. Trust me, this is not something that's worth living with it because
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:56.960]   there is a very simple cure. Roman is a wonderful organization. He was started by a young guy
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:03.200]   whose father is a doctor. He had a heart condition, didn't know about it until his father,
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.240]   fortunately his father is a doctor, said, "We're going to take care of it."
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:12.160]   Cold source, gentle herpes, premature ejaculation, hair loss, erectile dysfunction.
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:17.040]   These are things we as guys just go, "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Don't worry. I don't
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:21.680]   want to go to the doctor. I'm fine." With Roman, you can get medical care for ED. If it's appropriate
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:26.800]   from the comfort and privacy of your home home, you do it online, it's really easy. You visit
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:33.360]   getromen.com/twit. You'll do an online visit with an actual board certified doctor. And this is key.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:37.120]   They're not going to prescribe it if it's inappropriate. But if they decide treatment is appropriate
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.520]   based on your medical history, what you tell the doctor, they can prescribe the medicine.
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:46.320]   Like any doctor, genuine medication delivered in discrete packaging right to your door,
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:51.680]   and you even get free two-day shipping. In fact, I'm going to make it even better because we're
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:57.920]   going to waive the doctor's visit fee as well for you. So there's no reason to suffer in silence.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:04.000]   Visit getromen.com/twit. Connect with the doctor. Get your free online visit and free two-day
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:10.240]   shipping. But you got to go to getromen.com/twit. I think this is so important that I really want
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:14.480]   to get behind it and really encourage it. Guys, if you're watching and you're saying, "Yeah, yeah,
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:24.400]   honestly, getromen.com/twit." Getromen.com/twit. I'm really glad that they decided to trust us with
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:29.920]   this because this is a hot button, soft subject, and I think they trusted that we were treated with
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:38.000]   the dignity that it deserves. Now, I am really curious what you guys think of this. Superhuman.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:45.440]   You familiar with this? It was a email company that raised a lot of money,
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:54.800]   and all of a sudden this guy, Mike, and Mike Industries wrote a piece about it that caused a
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:04:05.120]   furore. Superhuman has a receipt system built into it. It's used by a lot of people to send out
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:12.320]   sales pitches and stuff. And what Superhuman does is they embed a hidden invisible pixel in
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:18.800]   the email when that's an image. So when your email program opens the email,
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:24.560]   it tags the image server, and the image server said it was red. It was here. It also will say
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:31.040]   where it was red because it knows from IP address roughly where. Mike Industries,
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:35.680]   Mike Davidson says, "Superhuman is a surveillance tool that intentionally violates privacy by
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:43.280]   notifying senders every time their emails have been viewed by recipients." Huge, huge kerfuffle.
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:51.040]   In fact, Superhuman, the CEO, posted and backed down. He said, "Okay, we're going to change our
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:59.200]   policies." I agree. I think this is really interesting because you're getting tracking pixels in every
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:05.040]   single email that you get. Look in your spam folder. Look for tracking pixels, and you will find an
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:13.920]   immense number of these. Every marketing message does it. It is hugely common practice. And people
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:21.600]   act like, "That's kind of how I was feeling like this." It is different when it's... You
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:28.560]   expect that kind of thing from a company, but when it's someone that you know or you're corresponding
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:34.480]   with, I couldn't explain exactly why, but it definitely feels different to me. And it feels a
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:43.120]   little bit more icky. Superhuman clearly took this seriously. Go ahead, Samo.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:49.920]   I think for me, what bugs me about this, and it's something he points out in the piece,
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:57.600]   he calls it a dark pattern of ethical decisions to say, "Well, we have this tracking pixel. Why
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:02.560]   not do this other thing? If people are okay with this, they must be okay with this as well." And I
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:10.080]   think what bothers me about this, and it's not something that we can solve, is that once everybody
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:17.600]   is doing it, it's again, the frog and the pot of boiling water, we can't really avoid or opt out
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:23.360]   of having our location tracked seeing whether we've read, people seeing whether we've read emails
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:29.600]   or not. And it's just kind of exhausting, I think. I don't have a solution to it. I think you're right
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:34.880]   that a lot of people are doing it. That means that it's super human-made and unethical decision.
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:39.520]   Do you ever turn and read receipts in iMessage? I don't know. No, because that's
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:44.720]   abuse, the psychological torture. But it's a feature you could turn on, right? Yes, it is.
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:47.840]   And there are those who point out, "Well, this is a problem with business emails. I don't know
[02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:51.520]   if you saw my email. I want to know if you saw my email. It's not unreasonable to say, "Did you see
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:59.520]   my email?" I just automatically assume that every email has a read receipt. I only use email
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:03.280]   programs that don't load images. And I would strongly suggest that anybody was worried about
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:09.200]   privacy. It's very simple. Look in your email settings. Can you turn off load images? And in most
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:15.120]   emails programs, you can. The ones I use, you can. And so those single pixel images are never
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:20.720]   loaded. So they don't get a read receipt from me. Superhuman responded, their CEO says,
[02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:26.240]   "We understand. We hear you loud and clear. We've stopped logging information for new email,
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:30.560]   releasing new app versions that no longer show location information." I think that's one thing
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:34.960]   that freaked people out is that location information. He said, "We never showed the city. We showed,
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:40.400]   you know, a generic kind of location. We're deleting all historical location data from our apps.
[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:45.760]   We're keeping the read status feature, but turning it off by default, such like Apple does, users who
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:49.840]   want it. We'll have to explicitly turning it on. And we're prioritizing building an option to
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:54.240]   disable remote image loading. So superhuman, actually, I think responded pretty well. They
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:59.040]   were shocked that they got hit with this because they said, "Well, but everybody does this."
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:06.640]   What is generic location information, if not city? Is that like country, state?
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:11.440]   Yeah, I think it was though. Yeah, you could see. Okay. Do not. He says,
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:15.360]   "Sometimes the product shows approximate location data, such as the state or country in which the
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:20.320]   email was read. We deliberately do not show city level data." Okay.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:24.640]   So for example, apparently I opened this email because there's Tuesday at 11.35 AM, there was
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:29.440]   Missouri, comma United States. That's you. You're the only person in Missouri.
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:34.720]   So you're looking at that Mike's blog post. Mike industries, yes. I can't blame Mike for writing it.
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:41.120]   It certainly got people to start thinking. But I would just say, I would go a little farther,
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:45.600]   say not only is superhuman spying on you, but almost all the spam market and all the marketing
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:48.800]   email you get every newsletter you subscribe to. Right. So you have tracking pixels. Mail
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:54.720]   shimp uses it. A lot of, don't you think it feels different though? If it's from, no?
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:00.560]   I mean, I guess if my grandma sent me an email, which she wouldn't, and she had a tracking pixel,
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:04.480]   then I would know that she did it by mistake. So I wouldn't be bothered by that either.
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:07.600]   Why does that bother you if she did that? She wants to know if you saw it.
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:12.240]   Well, that's what I mean. Like if it's on, then she did it by mistake anyway.
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:16.000]   But what if she did it by purpose? I'm trying to think. Maybe I would be.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.280]   If she didn't discuss it with me first, I think, let's come over ahead, please.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:25.280]   Yeah, it does bug me. Sorry, because I think a lot of times I'll see a text message, and I know
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:31.040]   I can't reply right in that instant. And it would really bother me as it does when I'm texting my
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:37.920]   dad on WhatsApp. Yeah, it's like, I swear I'm not ignoring you. And to have to like go through that
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:42.000]   process of being like, I'm going to reply to this later, but I'm going to do this thing first.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.400]   I just feel we shouldn't have to do that with remote communication. We should be allowed to
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:51.440]   take moments to ourselves and say, no, I will get to it when I get to it.
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:57.680]   I think it's fair to call it a dark pattern. I don't think that's unfair.
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:02.640]   And I like it. If you go to dark patterns.org, there's if you're wondering what that means,
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:07.360]   there's a really great site that explains essentially dark patterns are tricks.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:14.080]   They could be used by apps, websites, email programs that make you do things you didn't tend.
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:19.280]   Whether it's you know, it's those checked boxes when you download something.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:24.800]   Facebook that did that where you you authorized to have your email
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:29.280]   contacts. And then I think it was on one of the shows. I think we were doing a show together.
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:29.600]   Yeah.
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:33.040]   And they ended up having you log into your email through this.
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:34.160]   And then uploaded it.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:35.200]   Yeah. And uploaded it.
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:35.680]   Yeah.
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:36.080]   Yeah.
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:39.200]   Yeah. So they have this site is great dark patterns.org.
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:40.880]   They have different names for kinds.
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:41.760]   There's one whole.
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:47.120]   There's sneak into basket where you're purchasing something and then they put an additional thing
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:51.120]   in your shopping basket, figuring you won't notice and you'll just buy it.
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:57.120]   There's the roach motel, which is obviously a site you check into, but can't get out of.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:02.000]   There's privacy, zuckering. You're tricked into publicly sharing more information than
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.040]   you really intended to.
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:04.800]   Like your location automatically being out.
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:09.280]   Yeah. I think that what Superhuman was doing was privacy, zuckering.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:09.520]   Yeah.
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:10.720]   Yeah.
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:11.520]   I love that phrase.
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:18.160]   I watched this whole thing play out and I understood the upset,
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:23.920]   but I think the upset depends on you not realizing how often this happens. You should maybe be
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:26.960]   upset about it, but you've got to be upset with more than just Superhuman.
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:32.000]   Now, here's something I'm definitely don't think is a good idea.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:39.120]   China is installing, forcing visitors who are coming in through the Xinjiang region.
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:42.960]   That's where they're having all the trouble with the Weijer uprising and they're putting
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:47.360]   Muslims in concentration camps. If you come in through that border checkpoint,
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:54.000]   they're going to make you install malware on your phone that downloads text messages,
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.400]   calendar entries, phone logs and scans the device for over 70,000 different files.
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:00.320]   No big deal.
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.120]   This is from Vice.
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:03.280]   Boy, I think we can all agree that that one.
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.240]   That's a bad idea.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:10.080]   We can all agree that as soon as this article came out, the US Customs and Border Patrol
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:11.920]   wrote to China saying, "Hey, where can we get that?"
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:13.280]   Let's check out that.
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:15.840]   I'd like to download that.
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.880]   You know, I love the darkest pattern.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:24.560]   Yeah. This article is about Android devices, but I looked it up to see what they were doing
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:30.240]   with iPhones and the New York Times reported that they would unlock iPhones or get iPhones
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:33.200]   unlocked and then connect them via USB to a handheld device.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.720]   What that device did could not be determined.
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:39.200]   So they've got their worker on for iPhone 2.
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:39.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:40.000]   Don't worry.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:47.200]   Maybe question motherboards decision to publish this on GitHub, but you can actually download
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:50.640]   the application on GitHub.
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:54.480]   Yeah, maybe not. Maybe don't.
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:55.600]   Yeah.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:56.240]   Oh, no.
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:58.320]   You have to sideload it.
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:00.560]   Hey, yeah.
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.680]   Yay, karamba.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:06.720]   Boy, there's so much I'd like to talk about with you guys.
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:11.600]   I just, I don't want this show to ever end, but after all, my dream daddy awaits.
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:16.640]   So I really hope to God that you do download Dream Daddy and give it a go.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:19.040]   I just, I feel like I've learned something here tonight.
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:21.760]   I want to thank you, Simone, for teaching me.
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:27.040]   Simone de Roche for is a video producer at Polygon, Doom Quasar on the Twitter,
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:30.880]   and listen to her on Rocket, the Polygon show, and all sorts of other great shows.
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:32.640]   It's really fantastic to have you on.
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:33.040]   Please.
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:34.400]   Thank you so much.
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.280]   I have a really good time.
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:36.320]   Hope we didn't scare you.
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.280]   Come back.
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:39.200]   No, I'm glad that I could educate you.
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:44.720]   You and your Casper are always, and you've been your daddy, are always welcome on this note.
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:47.120]   Oh, Lord.
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:48.400]   I'm horrible laugh.
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:49.280]   Oh, Lord.
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:50.480]   I love your laugh.
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:52.960]   I always love you on Rocket, so I'm really thrilled to get you on.
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:54.480]   I feel like I'm kind of blushing here.
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:58.640]   And of course, I always blush when Patrick Pejat tells me he doesn't use your hand sheets.
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:13:59.360]   It's shocking.
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:13:59.920]   Shocking.
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:01.120]   Frenchman.com.
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:03.600]   Trust Frenchman to teach you about sheet sounds.
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:04.000]   Of course.
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.080]   He's taught me so much, not Patrick on the Twitter.
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:09.280]   Give us a plug.
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:10.320]   What do you want to plug today?
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:17.120]   Pixels, if you enjoy gaming and you speak English, and if you speak French,
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:22.240]   just try "La Ande du Tequere la Ande vous jous", which are in my two shows about, well,
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:23.360]   tech and gaming.
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:24.240]   I speak French.
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:27.360]   Ave vous una malay du frémage.
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:32.720]   Frenchspenthe.com.
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:33.120]   Thank you.
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:34.080]   Always a pleasure, Patrick.
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.080]   You stay up late with us and I'm very grateful.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:36.720]   Thank you for doing it.
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:37.680]   Well, thank you for having me.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.400]   Yeah, I love it.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:42.240]   And of course, we couldn't be happier than to welcome Michael Sargent.
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:45.120]   It's clearly going to be a big star here on Twitter.
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.520]   Thank you so much for giving us a chance to bring you and Luke out here.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:51.840]   And was it Mizzie and all?
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:52.960]   Well, Henry.
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:53.760]   Yes, Henry.
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:54.240]   Henry.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.200]   Spelled onry.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:56.240]   Spelled onry.
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:57.840]   The Chihuahuas will be joining us.
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:01.280]   You were out here looking at places and then end of the month.
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:02.560]   End of the month.
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:03.280]   I will be here.
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:03.760]   Okay.
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:05.280]   I'm really thrilled.
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:07.920]   And you'll see him Tuesday and iOS today.
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:09.520]   Yes, that was going to be my plug.
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:11.040]   Check out iOS today on Tuesday.
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:11.440]   Yeah.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:14.480]   But you do like 800 podcasts and I want to make a point.
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:16.480]   We are encouraging you to continue.
[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:21.360]   Yes, that was one of the sort of things that I would have been concerned about.
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:23.680]   I was like, oh, no, am I going to have to give up my too many shows?
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:26.480]   No, nor do we gain ownership or anything like that.
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:30.400]   This is anything you want to do in your limited spare time.
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:31.120]   Yeah.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:34.400]   So somehow I manage the podcast about the office.
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:34.720]   Yep.
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:36.400]   Will continue that.
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:38.080]   You've got hundreds of episodes left.
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:38.560]   Yes.
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:40.320]   It's only at season four, episode 10.
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:44.400]   Every office episode there's an episode.
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:45.360]   We're working through it.
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:46.720]   Tiffany Armenton, myself.
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:47.200]   That's awesome.
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:48.160]   All right.
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:51.040]   And the website chihuahua.coff.
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:52.080]   Chihuahua.coffy.
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:54.720]   CHI H-U-A H-U-A dot coffin.
[02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:59.120]   Start following Micah because I'm sure you'll hear more about his exploits here in
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.120]   Petaluma at Micah Sergeant.
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:01.520]   Yep.
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:03.200]   On pretty much all the social stuff.
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:03.760]   Yeah.
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:03.920]   Yeah.
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:05.200]   That Facebook owned company.
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:08.640]   Yes, see, I got rid of my Instagram and Facebook.
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.800]   I couldn't bring myself to get rid of Twitter, but I just--
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:13.120]   Facebook's gone, but I can't get rid of Instagram.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:13.760]   Look at Twitter like this.
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:14.080]   I go.
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:17.040]   Oh, I don't want to--
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:19.440]   Especially when it tweets out your blood pressure and you're--
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.640]   And then you're like, oh, no.
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:23.040]   I don't even remember the password that I count.
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:23.680]   I don't--
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:24.720]   What about last pass?
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:25.920]   And it's using--
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:28.720]   Oh, you know, this was probably so long ago that I didn't even have--
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:29.840]   You know what maybe it does?
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:30.400]   I should--
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:31.440]   You should check the--
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:35.920]   What I do know is that the if this, then that script that does that
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:37.840]   is on an if this, then that account I lost.
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:38.800]   Oh, I'm ready to say in that.
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:43.200]   Because I use second factor on it and then unaccountably deleted second factor.
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:43.760]   Oh, no.
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:45.200]   That's all right.
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:46.000]   You can call him?
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.280]   You can call him and say, please kill it.
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:48.640]   But I don't want to.
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:49.200]   I like it.
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:50.320]   I think it's hysterical.
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:50.800]   It is funny.
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:51.760]   Thanks for a great story.
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:55.440]   Anna, as long as I continue to lose weight anyway.
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:56.880]   Thank you everybody.
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:00.400]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, right about 230 Pacific.
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:03.360]   That's 530 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:04.640]   Would love it if you stop by.
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:07.120]   There's a couple of ways you could play the home version of our game.
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:12.320]   You can watch the live or listen to the live stream at twit.tv/live.
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:14.880]   If you do that, please join us in the chatroom.
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:17.120]   You can talk along amongst yourselves.
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:18.880]   We always are watching the chatroom during the show.
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:20.400]   So it's actually great for us.
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:23.120]   That's i-r-c.twit.tv.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:26.800]   You could also come to Petaluma if you're going to be in Northern California.
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:28.160]   Please join us in the studio.
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:29.840]   We have visitors from Australia today.
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:33.280]   Actually, two people ran out about halfway through.
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:36.160]   They had flown up from Southern California.
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:38.560]   But we've got Andrew visiting from down under.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:39.600]   Hi, Andrew.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:41.680]   And Charlie and Karen were here from Van Lines.
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:43.200]   They had a plane to catch.
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.680]   And Devin and Jolica.
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:47.520]   Is it Hologa or Jolica?
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:49.760]   Jolica visiting from Detroit.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:50.720]   Nice to have you.
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:52.640]   All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:53.920]   We'll make sure there's somewhere to sit.
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:56.640]   We'll send you packet information about how to find this.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:58.480]   Our secret fortress.
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.320]   It should be a fortress on Harry Potter.
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.040]   I wish.
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:04.320]   We wish it was not.
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:06.080]   We don't even have an inn next door.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:06.800]   You'd think.
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:07.440]   There's nothing.
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:10.160]   I ran out of lightning before the show even began.
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:12.080]   Which is the only reason I paid attention at all today.
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:17.680]   Sometimes they'll take the camera and they'll catch me going.
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:22.080]   Yeah, I noticed you're really good with those gestures.
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:23.120]   Getting good at my traces.
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:24.000]   I was impressed.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.440]   I love that.
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:28.800]   Thankfully, they didn't catch me taking selfies during the Get Roman Adread.
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:30.960]   I just wanted to promote the show.
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:31.840]   It's the best time to do it.
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:33.120]   It was.
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.600]   Okay.
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:37.760]   Let's see what else.
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:40.960]   Oh, we have downloadable versions of the show on demand.
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:41.600]   We call it.
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:47.360]   Some people call it podcasts at our website, twit.tv or subscribe.
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:48.480]   That's really the best thing to do.
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:51.440]   If you have a podcast application, just search for twit.
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:53.200]   Or this weekend tech, you'll find it right away.
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:54.960]   You can also ask your voice assistant.
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:58.320]   You could say, "Echo, play this weekend tech podcast."
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:18:59.440]   And she'll play it.
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:02.320]   Thank you all for paying attention.
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:03.200]   Staying up late.
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:04.000]   Whatever you did.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.440]   Thanks for ignoring it.
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:06.800]   If you didn't pay attention.
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:08.160]   But I'm glad you listened.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:08.720]   Keep listening.
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:09.520]   We'll see you next time.
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:12.080]   Another twit is in the camp.
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:12.480]   Bye-bye.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:22.000]   [Music]
