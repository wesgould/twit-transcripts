[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech to show the covers your weekly Tech News.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And boy, there's a lot of it, although most of it is about what's going to be happening next week.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   But first let me introduce our panel starting with Beauty Before Age,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Mr. Cherry Cornell.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's here. Science fiction writer extraordinaire.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I would say the senior tech reporter in the bunch, he's been doing it for longer than anybody else,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   starting with his Chaos Manor column in Bite Magazine, Legendary.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Great to see you again, Jerry. How's everything going?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Pretty good. They chopped the last of the cancer out of my nose, so I have now a three-time cancer survivor.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Holy cow, that cancer ain't going to get you, is it?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It ain't going to get me.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Wow, good for you. So you had brain cancer, I remember, that's gone.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Yep.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You have apparently nose cancer, that's gone. What else?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah, two kinds of skin cancer, and they're both gone now.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Hey, that's really actually great to hear. And you seem like everything's going well for you.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Pretty good.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Pretty good.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Awesome.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   John C. Devorek, aka Brian Brushwood, you look good in that.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You see people listening on audio, John's wearing a, what do they call it, a pork pie hat?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   No, it's a visor with hair coming out of it.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Pork pie hat?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Hey, would you get me my pork pie hat? I left it over there.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Also with us from Houston, Texas, Mr. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle, and the tech blog there,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and of course technology, what is it? Technology Bites? Look at that, see?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   You look like a pie hat.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You got the hipster look down.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I'm going to be playing the clarinet right now. But fortunately, I'm not. I'm drinking mangroia.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I'm drinking Adam Corolla's mangroia.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Wow. I'm sorry.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   You're drinking what? Adam Corolla's what?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Mangroia.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   He bottles it?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   No, it's actually bottled.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Oh, that's wine. I see what you're talking about.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It's from our friend here at the patio wine company in Napa, California. What's your name, sir?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It's not Steve Burke.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Birch.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Birch.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I have headphones and I can't hear a thing.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   No!
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   But anyway, this is Adam sells this on his podcast.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And Steve here bottles it for, mangroia.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And it sells well?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Yes. Very well.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   What does very well mean?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   100 cases a week.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And what does it go for a case?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   $180 a...
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Do the math.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Do the math.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Geez. You're kind of taking them for a ride.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Wow.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That's better than a knighthood.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yeah, that's a double knighthood.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   That's a double knighthood.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Wow.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Adam's doing very well.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Adam's doing...
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Adam Corolla.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Go ahead.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   With the Spanish sangria is traditionally the way they get rid of wine that didn't work out very well.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Is that what it is, Steve?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   This is Adam Corolla getting rid of the ideas that didn't work out.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So Adam sells everything.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I mean, Adam is really good at monetizing, which you have to be.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   You are too.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   No agenda show is really good.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Not as good as that wine monetization.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   But this is inspiring.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   We could do this with the no agenda wine.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Well, I have a friend in the business.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   He could hook you up.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   We'll make it better than this one.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Okay, so big story.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I don't know where to begin.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Apple sent out invitations this week.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Tuesday, Apple's going to have yet another event.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   We don't know what it is, but we believe, of course, it's the iPad mini.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   The next is seven.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   No, 7.85.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Slightly bigger.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Ah, showing off.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The rumors will be that it's basically an iPad 2, 12, 8, 10, 24 by 7, 68 in a smaller case.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Do I get any leads on this?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Anything you know about it?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   This is all rumor at this point, but I think everybody seems to agree.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's all rumor.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It's all vapor.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   I think they have to get into the space.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   What's interesting is more than the specs.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Everybody expects it to be a smaller, less powerful iPad, but I think what's most interesting is the pricing.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   John Gruber had an interesting discussion this week on daring fireball about the idea of whether
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   or not it matters if you take this smaller iPad and price it anywhere near the new iPod
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   touch that's come out, because what it starts at $2.99, I think.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   There's been some discussion about the iPad mini being at $2.49, and today's rumor from
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   9 to 5 Mac is $3.29.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I think Apple has to price it at $2.49 in order to be competitive with some of the Android
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   tablets and the Nexus 7 that have come out.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I don't think they can price it at $3.29 and expect to have a lot of sales.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   But I may be wrong.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's Apple.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   People will pay that.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   $3.29 too high, John?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   But if it has some specifically great feature that takes it out of the fray, I think it would
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   be fine.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   What kind of thing would it be?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Well, that's it.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I don't think there is one.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   They say this is going to be a education iPad that they're going to really focus on.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I book author.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I book three.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I presume that the $3.29 iPad will be eight gigs, which is enough for one textbook.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   These books are huge.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   They're four or five gigs each.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So it's not going to be the one.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Not only is that price too high, nobody's going to buy that one.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   You're going to have to buy the $1.16.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Actually, the rumor is it'll be an $8.32.64.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   There will be no $16.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   $8.32.64.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.720]   And I think if you end up having this at a too high of a price, you've got Amazon coming
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.440]   in with its new tablets, which are very nice.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:26.160]   I think the obvious trajectory for pricing is $2.50 and below for these seven-inch tablets.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.680]   And I just don't see how Apple could do it like that.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:37.360]   Unless it's incredibly thin, that it's as thin as say the iPod Touch, that would be really
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.080]   interesting if they did it, something that was just so remarkably thin that that was
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.960]   the big draw, that it was very sexy, easy to handle.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   Jerry, you're an iPad.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.280]   I know the fact I see it behind you.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   You're an iPad user.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.920]   I know you love the iPad.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.160]   For what it's worth, it's very good.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.600]   Of course, I've got the old one with no camera.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.360]   I was about to buy a new one.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.880]   And now I guess I'll wait to see what this looks like.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.480]   But I think I'll get the latest full iPad.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.760]   Well, somebody in the chat room a couple of days ago suggested that what that killer
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.920]   feature might be, and maybe John and Jerry, this will resonate with you.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   What if they put a really good camera in it?
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.280]   What if it had an excellent camera in it?
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.560]   That would do it, I think.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.080]   It wouldn't do it for me because I think walking around with a big clunker like that.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.080]   But it's not a big clunker.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   No, it's a little one with it.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.320]   The little one is still, get a camera.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.080]   There's real things in these phones are fine.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.080]   Now here's the thing.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   You don't get in the way.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.280]   You know, it's a big clunker.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.920]   No, but it's not that big.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   It's smaller.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.360]   I now use the iPhone as a camera.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.400]   Sure, so do I.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.320]   I carried cameras for years in addition to my phone.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:49.780]   I had a camera and a good pocket Kodak, you know, a 10 to 1 mechanical zooms and things.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:58.780]   I now find the iPhone 4 is as good a camera as I need.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.260]   Almost anything.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.180]   My friend Hans Peter Bronbo, who works for Nokia, is teaching a class and giving lectures
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:11.460]   on a new form of photography, which is focused on the software.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.900]   The lightro might be an example of this, where it's no longer the physical lens and the physical
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.620]   pickup, it's what you do with it after the fact.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:27.060]   And what better than to take a fairly powerful piece of computer, an iPad mini and put a decent
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.540]   camera on there, doesn't add the iPhone.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.020]   It won't be more powerful than what you're hearing.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.500]   I mean, the phones are pretty powerful.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.660]   Well, no, you're right.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.200]   It's in fact not anymore powerful if the rumors are, it's just an iPad 2.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   It's an A6, B86.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.700]   And this is more convenient.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.700]   It goes in the pockets.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.300]   You know, you're gonna carry a phone and a thing.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.860]   But you see, I'll tell you why I like the, I even shoot pictures with the iPad.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.300]   It's great for video pictures because you're seeing a big screen.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.020]   You're seeing what the picture looks like.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.620]   Even though you look like a total, you look like a dork.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.380]   But at least, yeah, you're right.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.380]   I agree with that.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.380]   It looks pretty cool.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.380]   There's something to be said for that.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.500]   So what if you have really powerful software on the other end?
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.620]   And now it's a computer camera.
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.620]   It's a digital photography.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.620]   Is that correct?
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.620]   Sure.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.620]   What if you bundled it?
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.620]   Sure.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.580]   What if you bundled it with, say the iPhone 5 camera?
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.580]   What if the iPhone 5 camera?
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.580]   Right.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.580]   Cape megapixel.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.580]   Great camera.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.900]   And then you say you put as a gimme on this iPhone.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.820]   Oh, the $5 iPhone.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.820]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.820]   I'm just, I'm trying to think of what might be, John, you know, that killer feature.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.540]   And I think that that's a good one.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.540]   I'll give you an example.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.780]   I went to see Madonna on Thursday.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.780]   What?
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.780]   What?
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.780]   The material camera.
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.780]   Like a version.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.500]   Well, you, did you go out to dinner with her or?
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.780]   No, no, I went to a concert.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.380]   Well, wait, you went to, you went to Denver.
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.380]   I went to Denver.
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.100]   This is decadent.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.340]   They do not allow you to, I know, I got, I got the weirdest email, which I'll share
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.340]   with you later.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.340]   From Madonna?
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.820]   No, from somebody who said, how decadent?
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.140]   But, but they don't let you bring a nice camera in there.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.380]   So I only had an iPhone.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.700]   In fact, that's all anybody had.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.700]   But I was able to get decent pictures, even, I mean, this is not an ideal.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.700]   I'm looking at it now.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.700]   With not an ideal.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.700]   You call it decent picture.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.700]   Well, or that.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.700]   It's not perfect.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.900]   I would love to have a DSLR.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.780]   Look at where your seats are.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.940]   You're in the third row.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.940]   That's what I said.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.740]   I had dinner with Madonna.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.300]   So, but see, everybody's got cameras.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.860]   By the way, one of the most, I mean, camera phones, one of the most annoying things.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.460]   This guy right in front of me, the whole show, he's like, I got to have a video of this show.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.220]   He's holding up his phone the whole time.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.820]   That's annoying.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.340]   I was hitting him in the head.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.740]   It's very annoying.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.740]   Leo didn't help.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.140]   He obviously didn't hit him hard enough.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.940]   Apparently not.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.200]   So, so Leo, David Byrne played here in Houston last week.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:48.820]   And one of the things that he did during before the show, he came over to the PA and he said,
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.660]   you can take pictures, you can take video, you can do whatever you want during the show,
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.820]   which was pretty cool, I thought.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:00.620]   But then he said, but please don't use an iPad to take pictures or video because in
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:06.080]   a concert setting, you have this big block in front of you, you know, so people can't
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.080]   see behind you.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.360]   And he specifically said, be thoughtful of the people behind you.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360]   Don't use an iPad.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:17.500]   There's one, two, three, four camera phones in this picture that I have to look through
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.500]   to watch the show.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.060]   You know, of course, I'm number five.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.980]   You're right there in the front.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.400]   You could have hit her with your phone.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.100]   That don't say no, they have good security.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.100]   No, it was really.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.100]   No, they can't stop a phone.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.260]   I got to tell you the technology in concerts now.
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.540]   I don't know if you've noticed this Dwight.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.620]   I don't think these guys go to concerts anymore.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.860]   But the technology in concert.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.500]   I went to that brick thing, the wall, whatever it was.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.500]   The wall.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.460]   They, the projectors, the CGI, the lights.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.740]   This is huge advances now.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.740]   These things are amazing.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:53.220]   And you go to an installation like Cirque du Soleil in Vegas where they're there permanently.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.820]   Have you seen love in Vegas?
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.820]   Unbelievable.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.420]   Yeah, there's a lot of love on the street, especially in Los Vegas Boulevard.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.980]   They all look like Elvis.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:05.900]   Do you think it doesn't mean a good not to let somebody bring in an actual camera?
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.700]   No, it's nuts.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.700]   I agree.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.700]   I have to say.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.900]   I'm impressed that David Byrne said no iPads because I totally agree with him.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.300]   That's such a bright, big light.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.300]   That's the last thing you want.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.420]   Yeah, but could you bring in a Panasonic real?
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.420]   It would be less annoying.
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.500]   Yeah, I would think so.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.900]   And I'd get better pictures.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.420]   And how does that hurt in any way?
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.420]   It's promotional.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.660]   But I understand artists these days are very nervous.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.540]   I'll tell you what makes me upset.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.980]   So you can put a gun in one of those real cameras.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.980]   That's the problem.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.980]   Maybe that's it.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.980]   You're right.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:37.980]   They're very security conscious.
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.980]   There you have it.
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.100]   Yeah, not by Madonna, but I got frisk.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.180]   You got frisks.
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.740]   I literally got a frisk.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.340]   You went, was there a metal detector that you looked when you set it off?
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.340]   No.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.340]   They saw you.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.340]   They said, what is this?
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.340]   Everybody going to the shore.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.340]   Everybody going to the shore.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.340]   Everybody going to the shore.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.340]   Everybody going here is like an elderly man going in.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.500]   No, put your arms out.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.780]   This is what they, not that way.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.780]   Have you never been frisk?
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:03.660]   They felt me up all up and down, all around, every part of my body, they squeezed, they
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.660]   prodded, they put it.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.660]   We're wearing that hat.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.900]   That could be it.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.340]   Was everybody going into this?
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.420]   I mean, security is incredible.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.540]   So did you fly to Denver just to go to the show?
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.540]   She never comes out here.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.540]   No, she was in Santa's act.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.540]   I couldn't get tickets.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.540]   Oh.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.540]   What is the show any good?
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.020]   Yeah, it's a great show.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.020]   It better be.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.940]   You know, it was very controversial because it's in Denver, right?
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.260]   And of course, the Aurora shootings nearby.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.180]   And there's a whole segment of the show where she is shooting people right and left.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.260]   In fact, she first appears on the show with a machine gun.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.060]   There's a lot of gun stuff in the show.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.540]   And it was very controversial.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.740]   I don't know how you take that out of the show because it's, you know, the show is a
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.140]   very broomstick.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.620]   Yeah, broomsticks.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.180]   Anyway, let's ask the questions.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.980]   John Gruber asked of the new iPad.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:59.980]   First of all, can how can the new iPad not have a retina display?
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.980]   How can it?
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.980]   How can it not have the rumor is it?
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.380]   Of course, it does have a 24 by 768.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.660]   In fact, you know, Google is having an announcement on the 29th in which their, the rumor is they
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:17.500]   will announce a very high res 300 plus DPI 10 inch tablet.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.340]   Yeah, Samsung tablet.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.500]   Running the new key lime pie version of Android 4.2.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.820]   So I thought it was kind of interesting.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.580]   So Apple's got their announcement on Tuesday.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:36.460]   Microsoft has the Windows 8 launch party on Thursday and the pop up stores open Friday.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.380]   The windows I've got my windows RT tablet will arrive Friday.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.580]   They sold those out, by the way.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.580]   They sold them out.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.540]   But a lot of people, I think a lot of people think because they're getting a Windows tablet
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.380]   that they'll be able to run their Windows applications on it.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:59.540]   I don't think the message about Windows RT being not able to run legacy Windows apps,
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.340]   except for the ones that are pre-installed on it, is getting through to people.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.180]   I think you're going to have a lot of people who are really upset and get it and can't
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.260]   put their favorite Windows apps there.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.860]   Microsoft's done something very interesting.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.940]   In fact, if you look at the ads, they've got Windows 8 phones, Windows RT tablets, and
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.260]   Windows 8 desktops all with the same Metro start page.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.500]   And the implication is it's the same operating system across the board.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.500]   And I think you're right.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.420]   I think people are going to be very upset when they get a Windows phone 8 and it doesn't
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.900]   run anything but Windows phone software.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.980]   RT tablet, which only runs RT software.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.780]   People were leaving comments in my blog about how excited they were to get hold of the surface
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.660]   they had already ordered it.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.460]   And they were looking forward to being able to use a Windows tablet.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.140]   And it was very clear that they didn't understand what they were getting.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.100]   It'll be three months before the surface that runs Windows 8 Pro comes out, and that will
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.860]   be a Windows.
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.060]   And that's the only one that interests me, actually.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:02.460]   You know, remember the old Windows tablets, the one that I love mine.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.820]   Yeah, because they designed the handwriting recognition with your handwriting.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.380]   Of course, yes.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.380]   Of course you loved it.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.180]   That was the most useful thing I ever had.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.740]   I still got it right over back over there, but the problem isn't.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.100]   She's pretty old.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.020]   You were the only person it worked for, Jerry.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.940]   Oh, well, I still have no, I have a convertible HP tablet with the.
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.540]   The problem was that that operating system wasn't designed around touch.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.980]   No, it was an after.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.340]   It was one of the best research tools I ever had.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.300]   You can make notes, you can copy things in, you can put videos in that.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.660]   And one note made a terrific research system.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.940]   No, I kind of agree.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.700]   In fact, I was kind of, I bought this tablet because I was sitting next to a salesman on
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.900]   a plane and he showed me how he used the touch interface with PowerPoint to do presentations
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.940]   and he could annotate and it kind of wowed me.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.940]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.220]   But then I got it home and it's kind of, I think it really is better to not have touch
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.020]   added to an existing operating system but designed from the ground up.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.540]   I think that's really why Windows 8 is going to be important whether it succeeds is another
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.420]   matter, but at least it's touched from the ground up, right?
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:19.020]   Yeah, I mean, well, it's actually a phone IO moved up one notch and then moved up another
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.020]   notch is ridiculous.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.820]   I mean, Microsoft is like skitsoid.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:29.540]   They started off in their olden days, they would take a desktop and then they shrink it
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.260]   and shrink it until they had the windows for phone, the original one was actually Windows
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.460]   on the phone with a stylus and it was like a little version of Windows.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.220]   And now they said, well, that didn't work.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:45.700]   So let's go the other way and design a phone operating system and try to put it on a desktop.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.020]   I mean, I don't understand whether there has to be the same interface for every type of
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.020]   device.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:58.260]   It doesn't take a genius to use an iPad and a Windows 7 for one minute and go to the next
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.260]   minute.
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.260]   You don't have to have everything.
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.060]   So it's exactly the same because you're an idiot.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.340]   Yeah, well, that's what I do.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.820]   You see the iPad behind me there?
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.260]   You're using it with a keyboard it looks like, Jerry.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.260]   Yeah, I've got the little keyboard that goes with it.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:20.180]   I would find the little iPad to be a pretty good machine to just carry around with me
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:26.660]   if it were just a little more powerful.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.660]   One of the things that is happening here is Microsoft is trying to do with this what
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:36.140]   it wanted to do with Windows CE long ago and the Windows mobile where it looked like
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.140]   Windows.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.580]   And so they're saying, oh, instead of starting with the desktop Windows and making a miniature
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:47.300]   version of it for these devices, let's start with what worked on touch and move it over
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.740]   to the desktop.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.020]   And in addition, there's a little bit of Apple copying going on, although not in the interface,
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:21:00.060]   but in the concept that if you keep it simple and make hard choices about what you don't
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.380]   have, you'll come up with a better operating system.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.580]   The problem is with Windows 8 is that they have grafted these two ideas together.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.060]   And I think if I think for people who buy like a tablet, like if you buy one of these
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.860]   little Samsung tablets or you buy a Windows RT tablet or the service tablet, I think you
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:21.580]   have a pretty good experience. It's the people who buy a traditional desktop or who buy a
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.500]   traditional notebook computer with this on it.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.420]   They're going to be really frustrated because jumping back and forth remains fairly jarring.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.220]   It's also there was a study done by the Nielsen Norman group.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:39.500]   They do usability testing and they noted that normal users who are not like us kind of inquisitive
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.980]   when faced with Windows 8 just were kind of baffled because they weren't willing to kind
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.820]   of click around. They'd try because you get the charms by moving the mouse in the lower
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.060]   right hand corner. Then you get charms. Then you have to do this to shut the machine down.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:57.020]   You have to get the charms bar to shut up to start. Click the gear. I mean, it's four
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.980]   steps to turn the machine on.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.780]   I actually think.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:06.220]   And people, yes, if you knew that it's Windows key C, it could do it much faster and so forth.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.900]   But people don't know that. They don't read the instructions. And so the lack of discoverability
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.420]   Nielsen Norman found they thought that was going to be a problem with kind of non sophisticated
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   users.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.660]   Did you sign some instructions?
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:23.580]   Well this was also a debate. I know when Microsoft was debating this, they were trying
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:30.820]   to figure out should we put a movie in the computer when they turn it on to show you
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.820]   how to use it.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.100]   Yeah, have Chris Perillo's father do the movie.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.940]   Yeah, he's an example of somebody who's just baffled. Couldn't figure it out.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.980]   So they do have video in the help file.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.300]   Yeah, they're going to do it.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.420]   They decided to do it.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.780]   And so today I was playing around with it and I was playing with it on an older machine
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:55.260]   I have that has a 19 inch monitor. And I was trying to make it make it snap with two,
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.820]   you know, you can put two Metro well, it turns out, and I didn't know this till I saw the
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.300]   movie in the help files.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:09.460]   That you can't that you can't snap to Metro apps on the same screen if it's lower than
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:14.300]   a certain resolution as to be 1300. So I couldn't do it on my 19 inch monitor.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.540]   And you thought there was something wrong with you?
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.060]   I thought, well, I thought, oh, yeah, well, you know, why can't I make this work? And I've
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.660]   done it on the tablet, but I couldn't make it work on this. But there's no indication
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.180]   you're not told in any way unless you go looking in the help files and who looks in the help
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.180]   file.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:35.580]   Well, why would you look in a Microsoft help file? Has anybody on earth ever gotten the
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.700]   help from a Microsoft help file?
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.460]   Actually, at Windows seven, they're not bad. You know, you know, I will agree. They're not
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:49.460]   bad in seven, but I've been playing around. I've got two machines very fast, one with seven
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:57.580]   and one with eight and eight driving me nuts. If you like desktops, you will not like Windows
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.260]   eight very much.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.940]   So Steve Jobs used to say stay what it was, stay hungry, stay foolish. Somebody in the
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.260]   chat room said Microsoft's motto is stay clueless, stay clunky.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:14.500]   Yeah, that's good. Yeah, yeah, that could they could use that. They could pay money for that.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:24.260]   Well, some parts of eight work very well, but other parts are just baffling and needlessly
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:31.260]   so. Yeah. I mean, why can't I have a view that lets me have the little close file go from
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:41.580]   full screen to Windows, you know, the usual one to Windows seven's fine. Windows seven's
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.820]   as good as Mac.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.420]   If we thought that, remember that little era between XP and Vista and people refusing
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.300]   to upgrade and refusing to upgrade and demanding they keep it on the market and making Dell
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.900]   sell them Windows XP because they've nobody wanted Vista. This is going to be going on
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.300]   again. This is just a repeat. People are going to demand us keep with seven.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.300]   I think you're right.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.060]   I'm going to take a break. I was going to go through John's questions, a groupers questions,
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.260]   but I think we're doing a much better job anyway. So if you want to read it and during
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:15.540]   Fireball done that he he this is, you know, John Goober's really become an Apple apologist.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:21.260]   And so he poses all of the negative questions like how could Apple possibly charge $329
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.820]   and he answers it. You know, well, let me explain why he almost says why we're doing
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.780]   this. By the way, the name is a is a big question. There's no way they're calling an
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.180]   iPad mini. No, sounds like a female hygiene product.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:44.860]   I wouldn't think so. So what do they call it? He guesses iPad air. No iPad. Small iPad,
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.060]   just iPad. And you get it in different size.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:54.740]   Any pad. There you go. That's definitely not mini. All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.060]   We got I tell you, we got a great panel. I don't care what the news is. Let's just talk
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:02.740]   to Jerry, John and Dwight and just have some fun here. Drink more man. Gria. Thank you,
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.980]   Adam Corolla. Thank you, Steve. Sure Adam Corolla. Would rather you buy it.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.380]   So I'm going to go get some I'm going to get some burger. Guys, we're going to be
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:17.580]   in Korea. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Get the pencil on. It's in bourbon. 180. Yeah.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:24.540]   Dollars a case. 100 cases a week. Yeah. We got asked for the junk wine that he's buying.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.580]   Shh. Oh, college. I shouldn't say that guy makes it. The guy makes it sitting right over
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:38.140]   here. Well, he says it's traditionally sangria in Spain is the one they couldn't sell in
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:44.820]   the other way. So they mix it with fruit juice, pour it in rum and there you are. They still
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:50.700]   do that. It's a big party drink. It's a punch. It's a punch. It's a man. Gria. Yeah. There's
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:56.020]   no claims made as to this, you know, this is what it is. It is what it is. The fact that
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.940]   it's in a bottle and not a plastic thing with a screw top is beyond me. That's $18,000 a
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.620]   week. Hello. Get your pickled as well as anything else.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:10.100]   Well, 18,000 dollars a week. Well, there's some. For me, and Gria. Oh, there's over here.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:15.300]   I mean, I, what is the box? What is the what is the take home on that? I mean, this is
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:23.420]   that was what's the name of $15.00 bottle of sangria. It's about $14.95. He would know half
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:29.780]   of that federal taxes. I'll get a size tax. Yeah. They get you every time. So let's talk
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:34.580]   about go to meaning. Oh, oh, I think we have a winner. We were given away an iPad. Is there
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:40.660]   a winner on this list? Yes, there is. So go to meeting.com. Let me tell you a little
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.340]   bit about go to meeting.com and I'll tell you who wins the iPad. So this is an online
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.380]   meeting service. We've talked about it before. It's the number one, I think, online meeting
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.540]   service where you share the screen. It's very efficient. The folks who do this, Citrix
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:58.060]   invented remote desktop. They know how to do efficient screen sharing, but now they've
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:04.540]   added something that makes it super compelling. They've added video. So now you can actually
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:09.020]   see the people you're meeting with go to meetings. Always been the go to choice when
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.540]   you can't get together for a face to face meeting. Now I don't even know why you'd bother
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.860]   because you're seeing your clients or colleagues. You're working together. You're collaborating
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.980]   and you can start a meeting on a Mac or a PC, but you can attend meetings on an iPad,
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:26.260]   an iPhone, an Android tablet. In fact, if you have an iPad, oh, is this sweet? It will
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.180]   use the camera on the iPad. The effect that this would be so good with a new iPad uses
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:34.860]   the camera on the iPad, uses the headphones and the microphone. You could be out in the
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.020]   garden. You could be at a hotel. You could be at an airport. You could be anywhere and
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:43.940]   attending a meeting just that easy. You could share content from share file or drop box on
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:50.020]   the iPad. I mean, this illustrate highlight whiteboard. This is just a fantastic product.

[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.580]   I haven't gotten a chance to go get it, but there's a bottle of makers mark down there

[00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:04.180]   Jerry there to a smooth the way? Smooth the way I'm having a Pepsi Cola. Thank that's
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:11.020]   good. Thank you to somebody who's a fruit those corn syrup. What's wrong with this?
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:18.180]   I'm going to be a corn syrup. This is a diet Pepsi Cola. There you go. Better. I'm afraid
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:25.060]   you get to be my age. The crown royal is not so much in the picture anymore. Yeah, I don't
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.860]   blame you. I'm old enough not to drink it. I certainly not going to mix it with whatever
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:37.340]   the hell that is. LOL. So I don't is this a story the Russian Orthodox Christians say
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:42.900]   that Apple's logo is blasphemous. I never you know, I never even thought of the bite
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:52.820]   out of the apple. Here's John's reaction for video only WTF. Oh, he can be harpo marks
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:57.740]   on this show. According to a Russian news report, some conservative believers see the
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.660]   image of the bitten apple as a symbol of Adam and Eve's original sin in the Bible. Some
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.220]   have gone so far as to cover up the logo and replace it with an image of a little late
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.500]   in the game. I don't I think this can't be this logo has been around since 1975. This
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:19.740]   is a pretty bogus story. I think yet somebody has decided on a publicity grab. Yeah. So apples
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:25.820]   in the news. Let's mention that's mentioned. That's sacrilege. It'll get us some SEO.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.820]   Um, Apple. Okay. So I think we've covered the apple announcement that we didn't mention
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.300]   the fact that the rumors are besides the iPad, the little iPad, there'll be a new versions
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:39.620]   of the bigger iPad with the lightning cable that was inevitable. Unfortunately, I, you
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.860]   know, I like the lightning cable. Once everything's moved over to it, it'll be fine. It's just
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.740]   it's I got to buy new cables. The number of announcements is interesting. You got Apple.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:52.420]   You got, I know it's great Google. You got two Microsoft announcements. Samsung. You got
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:56.780]   two Microsoft. It's crazy. I mean, I thought we were done with this. So that last month
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.740]   was September was supposed to be announcement month October is even crazy month. So they
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.020]   will also invited to one of these things. Not one, not one. But anyway, they'll announce
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:14.420]   the new, uh, the dean of technology, journalism in America, Jerry Pournell, not one of them.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:21.580]   Well, you're not a blogger who said that the, um, the original Macintosh was a wonderful
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:26.660]   operating system attached to a toy computer and Apple didn't like that. That was that.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:32.660]   That was the end of it ever since John Scully passed it along to Michael Spindler who passed
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:37.140]   along to Gil Emelio who passed along to Steve Jobs. They all said, remember that guy, Jerry
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.420]   Pournell, don't let him in. That's actually the way it works. Tim Cook got it. That's what
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.220]   happened to you when you, when you got, you got black ball that you haven't been back.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:51.100]   When you send to the CEO ship at Apple computer, you get, and then get, you get three envelopes.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:57.460]   Box of names, box of names. Do not let this guy in. Um, so they'll also announce new Mac
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:03.140]   minis, new iMacs and new, and those will both use, I guess, the Ivy Bridge Intel updated
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:08.660]   Intel processors, probably USB three. They'll probably get rid of the firewire port thunderbolt
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.980]   and USB three will be the cross the board. And, uh, I think the most significant of the
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:18.460]   announcements will be a retina Mac book pro 13 inch to go with the 15 inch retina, which
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:24.740]   by the way is a great computer. I recommend it is really like it. Um, there will not be
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:29.300]   him. Mac pro. Nobody's nobody's saying the word Mac pro. And that's weird because we
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.340]   have, we need one. There's, there hasn't been a new one in ages. Apple really is abandoning
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.780]   the Mac market. I think what didn't didn't come to him. Say it. I use the gentleman.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:42.620]   Yeah. Didn't Cook say earlier in the year that there would be he implied there be Mac
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.940]   pros next year next year. He's just, yeah, he's kicking it down the road, kicking the
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:53.020]   can down the road. Yeah. Yeah. I think he answered somebody's email. Some Mac users email.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:58.620]   The implication was that it'd be next year. By the way, I got, I got an invitation to
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:03.740]   both of the Microsoft events and I can't go to either one of them. Actually, I also got
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:08.300]   an invitation to the windows. Yeah. Yeah. I get invitations to the Microsoft. Basically,
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:12.340]   they're begging anybody to go that will come. I'm going to go to the one on Monday. It's
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:18.260]   going to be San Francisco. Yeah. Should go. So, so to recap, Tuesday is Apple. We'll
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:23.460]   cover that live, by the way. Thursday is Microsoft's Windows 8. It's more of a part.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:27.460]   You didn't cover it live with the puppets. We might have puppets. Would you like? Did
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:31.980]   you like the puppets? I thought that was your best television ever. Tim Cooked puppet.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.580]   A couple puppets and then the talk to over the puppets. Because we couldn't do it live,
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:41.060]   we'd do a reenactment. Yeah. Yeah. It was something. And then Thursday, we will also be
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:45.220]   at the Windows 8 event top, Paul Therotten, Mary Jofoli will be covering that. We'll do
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:52.020]   a special Windows weekly. The pop up stores, 32 new Microsoft stores will open on Friday.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.540]   They've been handing out vouchers. If you go to the mall where there's a pop up store,
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.220]   you could get a voucher for a surface. So, some people will be able to go to the store
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.420]   and get them. But apparently three week delay now, if you go to the Microsoft store online.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.780]   Oh, they're packing them in. You know, it could be that they only made a hundred. We
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.020]   don't know. It's doesn't, it's not meaningful. They did announce that they made like 350,000
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.020]   million. There are some rumors. There are some rumors about three to five million of them.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:23.500]   But you know, that's the number. If I, this is, that's one device that you should wait
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:30.260]   and see what all of the apps, the adopters, where the apps and no one has actually had
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:35.260]   a chance at the event when they launched the surface, they wouldn't press type on the little
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.860]   little. But they still haven't let anyone touch it. No, they know what has touched this
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:44.860]   device yet. Right. Now I ordered one and I, and I ordered one right at the beginning.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:50.620]   So I will, I will get it Friday. So you have, you'll have an RT, when I have an RT 99 one.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:56.260]   I, yeah, I wasn't. I got the cheapest one I could find. Did you get a keyboard? Well,
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:00.660]   okay. So here's the deal. Now they've, they've changed how, well, let's see, let's, let's
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.900]   go shopping. Should we go shopping? I think so. So I got confused and now they've rearranged
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.540]   this from the way it was. And I think it was because people were confused. It used to say
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:16.340]   32 gigs without black touch cover. And then the other one said black touch cover with
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:21.540]   black touch cover. I thought it said with black touch cover. Oh, so you paid $4.99 expecting
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.340]   a cover and I didn't get one. So I then ordered, I thought, well, if I'm going to buy a cover,
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:29.620]   I might as well get for 10 bucks more. A blue one. No, you can only get it in black, the
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.620]   surface type cover. So there's two cover. This is even more confusing. There's a touch
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:38.700]   cover and a type cover. What do you think the difference is? One is got colors. That's
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:45.260]   right. Yeah. And, and the type cover has a little bit more play in the keys. Ah, it
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.260]   has actual keys. Well, I don't think they move. I think they're rubber keys. They're
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.280]   check like a rubber, that rubber keyboard that you can buy, you know, it's a rubber
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.940]   eel keyboard. Yeah, but it's a rubbery. IBM PC, Jr. It's a PC, Jr. keyboard. PC, Jr.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.420]   Good. I remember how well that did. Yeah, that was one thing. I think it's more like
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:07.780]   the rubber keyboard. So PC, Jr. was a real, it was hard. This is like chickless. Well,
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:14.460]   we'll find out. Nobody has seen this. Let alone typed on it. So the surface touch cover
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.820]   does have keys painted on the surface and you type on them, but they don't move. They're
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.620]   not raised. Oh, I didn't know that. You can type on that. So you pay the extra 10 bucks
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.940]   to have some more the right keys. Boing, boing, boing, boing. I don't think it goes
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.500]   bling, boing, boing. I think it's just right. Bling, bling, bling, bling. I think it's a
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:37.060]   chicklet keyboard. I don't know. As anybody does anybody know, nobody knows. They don't
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.660]   tell us anyway. So that's what I'll be getting. But that only comes in black. You're are you
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.980]   going to get the black one? I thought you're going to pay 10 bucks more. 10 bucks more.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:53.140]   You don't get color. What? You understand my confusion? I, I, but I got the email for
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.020]   Microsoft. They said that's what? I didn't get a keyboard. So I went back, but fortunately
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.300]   it's all going to forever Friday. So come back next Sunday and I'll show you. You could
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:06.740]   play with it. And what happens if this dog grabs it? Yeah, chew it right up. The issue
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:13.300]   is going to be an A, no 3G, right? No 4G, no 3G, no wireless. No 2G. It's just Wi-Fi.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:18.220]   No 2G Wi-Fi. Oh, well. And B, there's not, what apps is going to come with office? And
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.580]   I think that the office app is a desktop app as well as a metro app. Sure. It's just not
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.860]   online. Right. Dwight, this is the only way. It's basically a Chrome box. It's like, no,
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:32.500]   it's a real operating system. Okay. And most of the apps from the metro side will, you can
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.700]   grab them and download them and use them on the surface. There apparently are a couple
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:41.900]   of them that don't work, but almost everything that's on the app store will work on the metro
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:47.300]   side. So they're really selling this as a metro device. So that's, so, so maybe that's
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.300]   their explanation to people who've taken home and say, well, wait a minute, I can't run
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.100]   my, my, I can't do this. They're going to run into that problem, by the way. People
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.780]   are going to take it home thinking it says windows. Yeah, it's not windows. It's windows
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:05.340]   RT. Yeah. Well, what does RT mean? Real time. What? Real time. Like windows. Not real
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:11.380]   time. That's not real time. Run time. Somebody puts that. That's the win RT kernel. That's
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:18.100]   what RT means in the way. So Microsoft has rotten tomato RT product called Windows retweet,
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:25.780]   Windows retweet, real trash, real technology. What did NT stand for? New technology. Yeah.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.340]   What is RT stand for? Really old technology. Retread technology. Retread technology. It's
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:36.100]   good. Retread technology. There we go. Is that the official twin name now? I don't know.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.660]   Rough times. I don't know. Anyway, I, I'm, I'm, I'm reserving judgment. I want to like
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.780]   this thing. I want it to be elegant, beautiful. I want it to be usable. I have had the experience
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:49.780]   of using windows eight on a touchscreen and it really makes much more sense. Let's stand
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:55.780]   for RT rubber touch. Rubber touch. That might be the guys at the chat room are on a roll here.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:02.900]   Redmond trash. Redmond trash. Real tablet. Recycled tech. Real tired. Real tablet. Maybe
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:12.020]   it's tired. Yeah. All right. We. Okay. I don't, I don't want to. All right. So the stores open
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:19.140]   on Friday, pop up stores. Now that's this coming week. Yay. Next week. There are, there's the
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.820]   phone announcement, which you're going to and then Google said like just at the last minute,
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.340]   a couple of days ago, Hey, well, we're going to have something before then. Well, the Google
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:31.620]   one's going to be on the same day in New York, but in New York, so they can get the earlier
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:37.140]   deadlines so they can, they can ace them now. Why would Google even care? Why does Google
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:41.940]   want to undermine the windows phone? They don't trust Microsoft. They think it's
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:46.580]   possible that I'm going to go to this for one reason only. I want to see if Microsoft pulls
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.500]   a Google and actually gives the phone away to everyone who shows up. They should. They should,
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.660]   but I'm guessing and actually I would take money on this. I'm not going to do it because I'm not
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:59.860]   a betting man, but they won't do it. They won't be a good. They did it with CE, you remember?
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:06.820]   They had that big, yeah, well, Treasure Island and Cad Condax and everybody who went into the,
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:11.940]   to the display got a got a got a free little CE. Yeah, I vaguely remember that.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:17.060]   So the next web, and I don't know if they have good sources or not, but the next web claims
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:25.060]   some very interesting things about this Google event. They say, and I think this is intriguing.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.620]   Of course, we expect Google announce a phone. This will be the next Nexus phone. It'll be LG.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:36.180]   We've known about this for a while. Right. Very nice Nexus phone, quad core 1.5 gigahertz.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:42.020]   The rumor is it'll run 4.2, the next Android, which we think is going to be called Keyline Pi.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:46.340]   Actually, in fact, they're going to call it Jelly Bean, but just the next Jelly Bean.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:54.660]   Jelly Bean 2? Jelly Bean 2, I don't know. It'll have a 4.7 inch, 1280 by 768 display. That's a nice
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:43:01.940]   iris display. Two gigs of RAM, 16 gig storage, 8 megapixel rear, 1.3 megapixel front camera,
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:08.180]   and a 2100 milliamp battery, which is not a very high power battery. The more interesting device
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:16.740]   will be the Samsung 10 inch tablet, which we mentioned earlier, rumored to have 2560 by 1600
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:23.540]   pixels on 10 inches. That'd be nice. 300 pixels per inch. The iPad is 264. This is super retina.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.700]   People are going to want to see those 10 inches. Well, now, do those use a
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:33.460]   stylus or a... No, no, no, no, no, no. Can't have that, Jerry.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:42.900]   See, what I want is a fast edition of the old Microsoft tablet, the HP compact tablet.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:47.380]   That would tell you... They're a Windows 8? It's a useful computer, I can imagine.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:52.020]   I don't know. They're Windows 8 tablets that are coming out that will have styluses,
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:56.740]   so they're doing what they can do, appeal to those folks, whether it has the same handwriting
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.420]   recognition capability. It probably depends on what kind of software they put on it.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:05.220]   Well, if they put any handwriting recognition software in it at all,
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:14.180]   it will still be based on the old paragraph core, and that'll recognize my handwriting.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:17.620]   You got it. It's all Jerry cares about. It's all about Jerry's handwriting.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:22.020]   It's all about Jerry's handwriting. Now, this is the Google, the Galaxy Note 2. This is the
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:26.260]   five and a half inch. Look at the size of that thing. That's what... I love it when people say
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:32.740]   that when I whip it out. So, this is... That's what she said. This does have a stylus, and it has a...
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:37.140]   See that? That'll be lost. Let me see the stylus. It's nice. No, it won't be lost. You know why?
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:41.540]   It's gonna be lost. No, it has a thing in the phone when I walk away from the stylus. The phone beeps.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:47.220]   Well, I have to go farther away, but the phone yells at me. So, now John's gonna steal my stylus
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:52.100]   to test it. See you later, John. Keep going. Not yet. Keep going.
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:59.700]   You got it, didn't you? Keep going, John. Go down the street.
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.420]   Down the street.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:07.380]   No, it does. You have to be a ways away.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:11.780]   What that you'll be getting on the plane, where you left this thing at the counter.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.700]   I'm a little disappointed. I didn't try it. It did say it would do that.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.140]   Yeah, well, it doesn't. There's a button you can push.
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.580]   There's a button. Now, watch. Now, you can... Okay, go ahead. I'll let you play with it.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.180]   Just don't turn it into Russian again.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.740]   Greek is the latest one I like to use.
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:31.380]   Yeah. So, it does... It windows. It windows. You want to see you can have two windows on the
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:37.620]   screen. If I press and hold the menu, then I can have... You know, you can watch videos.
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:38.980]   No, this is a nice unit.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:43.620]   I love it. Yeah. But that does have a stylus. So, I wouldn't be surprised to see Samsung put
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.460]   maybe use... You know, the Samsung Note tablet.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.140]   You feel like an idiot with a stylus thing. Hey, hi. I'm on the phone.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.660]   No, you look fine. What are you talking about?
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.180]   I'm on this giant phone.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.980]   Well, if you act like that, you look like an idiot.
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:03.460]   You look like those early cell phones, the ones that were about the size of a military
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.260]   walkie. Yeah, he looks like Michael Douglas in Wall Street.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:06.820]   Hello, Mom.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.700]   Now, let me try it with the hipster hat. Let's see. How does this look?
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.820]   Oh, that looks great.
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.220]   Oh, it looks good. Yeah, hipster is a good one.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.980]   That wouldn't go work with a hipster thing.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.540]   Yeah, it works.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.580]   It's actually a hipster phone.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:17.460]   It's a hipster phone.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.100]   Yeah, I get it.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.100]   No, that work looks good. It looks like I'm playing in a jazz.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.460]   You look like a typical hipster with the phone. Yeah, I agree.
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.660]   Hey, hipster, you lost your pen.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.380]   Give me my pen.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:34.180]   Well, but you understand that if you get the right app on it, you can use it like a saxophone.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:34.820]   Exactly.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:37.540]   That looks normal.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.020]   I actually love this phone. It's gigantic.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:48.020]   I have to say, I am a little more sourd on the iPhone 5, having used it now for a few weeks.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:48.740]   Aha.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.140]   Not having a zigat on there is a big thing.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.180]   You know, not having Google Maps.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.060]   You're going out all the time flying to Denver for dinner.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.020]   Exactly. I couldn't find a good restaurant in Denver on the iPhone,
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:58.980]   but I could on the...
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.140]   Let me tell you something. There's no good restaurants in Denver.
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:08.420]   So you don't like the Google Maps on the web?
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.780]   The web? Oh, that's not a good...
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.220]   Do you think that's a good solution?
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.420]   No, it's not a good solution, but it's all we have, Leo.
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:22.500]   No, actually, if I have found that using the maps just like day to day,
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.780]   just like to find places around town, for the most part,
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.060]   they get me where I want to go.
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:33.860]   At one point, it took me to a location of a car dealership in Houston that had closed 20 years ago,
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.220]   but otherwise I've had pretty good luck with it.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.460]   But Google Maps has done the same thing to me too.
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.140]   So they all screw up.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.780]   No maps is perfect. I think the maps thing is overblown,
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.940]   but I have to say that if that...
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.660]   It turns out when you're traveling, that is an app you use a lot.
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:52.500]   And I did like having Google Maps on an Android device,
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.540]   as opposed to not having it and having just Apple Maps or Waze.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.820]   I use Waze. I like Waze.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.220]   Do you have LTE and Petaluma?
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.820]   Yes, and it's very fast.
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.020]   And I do miss the LTE.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:02.740]   It's amazing.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:02.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.300]   Verizon. We have Verizon LTE.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.900]   We're getting Sprint LTE.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.220]   Sprint's trying to rush out LTE.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:14.100]   You know, during the show last week, Sprint then asked that they were sold to SoftBank for 20...
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:14.260]   Right.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.540]   Yeah, they have it.
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:16.420]   ...billion dollars.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.940]   Now Sprint has launched LTE as a genius.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:20.900]   And it's not...
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.380]   It's not?
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:22.340]   It's not?
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.100]   No, it's very spotty.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:31.060]   You're lucky if you find it, and when you do, it's not as fast as Verizon or AT&T in my experience so far.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.580]   What has Nest been here at Star...
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.140]   Sorry.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.260]   Nest is my thermos thing.
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.940]   You want to turn on the hit in my house?
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.100]   Let me take a look.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:38.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:39.460]   Go ahead, Jerry.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.100]   Sorry.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:40.580]   Yes, sir.
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:44.100]   Do you think that sale of Sprint is kind of significant?
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:53.140]   What you have here is a major Japanese corporation exporting capital from Japan to America.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.900]   A lot of capital.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.380]   They seem to think that they're going to make a lot more money on their capital by buying
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.620]   Star in America than they are in investing in Japan.
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.140]   And that, I think, is a very significant thing to think about.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.300]   Why is it...
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.820]   Well, now the Japanese economy has not been in good shape, am I right?
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.580]   For the last 15, 20 years.
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.260]   It's slot for 20 years.
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.380]   Yeah, since the 80s.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.060]   Japan that could say no and they did.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:23.380]   Now, interestingly, China has been investing in the US as well, right?
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.180]   Yep.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:30.980]   So while we here in the US feel like we're going through terrible economic tribulations
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:37.860]   and look to the east as the rising tiger, in fact, they're looking to us.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.060]   Yep.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:39.380]   Why?
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.100]   Wouldn't you?
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:42.420]   Yes.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:50.660]   I mean, betting against the United States is one of the best ways to go broke on Noah.
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.900]   Well, it's because we still...
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.420]   And everybody who's tried it had.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:56.020]   We still innovate here, don't we?
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:56.500]   This is...
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.020]   Remember back when we innovated...
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.340]   ...the man was buying up Yankee Stadium and the Brooklyn Bridge.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:07.700]   And half of Hawaii would belong to Japanese tourists.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.860]   So what happened?
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:17.060]   All these Yankee real estate salesman took them for a ride and they took their haircut, didn't they?
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.220]   Didn't they own Rockefeller Center for a while?
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:19.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.540]   They owned Rockefeller Center for a while.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.340]   Well, the...
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.860]   My publisher was there.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.380]   The funny thing about the Rockefeller Center thing is that unlike...
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.900]   They didn't ever sell it.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:29.700]   They walked.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.140]   Really?
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:31.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:32.900]   They just walked.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:33.380]   They said...
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:33.780]   They went...
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.860]   We're done?
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.420]   You have it?
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:36.900]   It's yours.
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.300]   Bank.
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:37.620]   Take it.
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:38.900]   It was like a foreclosure.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.380]   It was just...
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:39.780]   They walked.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.500]   They walked from the deal.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.220]   They just left it.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:41.620]   All right.
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:48.500]   That Yankee traders may not be quite as dumb as the Japan that can say no thought we were.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.340]   Now, I mentioned ways the mapping app.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.100]   That's an Israeli product.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.740]   But I think that still the majority is certainly in the app economy.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:55.860]   Most sod, probably.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.900]   Yeah, probably.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:57.460]   Oh, God.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.900]   I didn't even think of that.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:50:59.540]   Now you know.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:04.180]   That it's in all likelihood, especially in the app economy, that much of the innovation
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.860]   that's happening is happening here in the US.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.740]   Doesn't like the app economy to keep things propped up.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.900]   Hey, it's all we got.
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:13.380]   What?
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.420]   99 cents.
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.460]   It's all we got.
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.660]   99 set apps.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:17.460]   We got them here.
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:19.620]   Look.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:30.020]   We have known since early science fiction days that the productivity of labor was going
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:34.980]   to keep going up and up and up, which meant fewer and fewer people needed to produce the
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.180]   same number of goods.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:36.500]   Right.
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.260]   Now, we've known that since the '40s.
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:42.260]   Hell, I wrote science fiction stories about it in the '70s.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.940]   I remember Jeremy Rifkin's book, The End of Work, in the '70s.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:49.460]   So why are we surprised now that the
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.740]   productivity factor is enormous over here?
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.380]   But the industrial base is declining.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.900]   The Rust Belt is declining because it's a service economy.
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:51:59.380]   It's a service economy.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.580]   You were people.
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:00.820]   No.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:07.060]   If you stop to look at it, the United States produces about as much as it ever did.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:07.780]   Does it really?
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.860]   Mostly bombs and planes.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.820]   No, but people doing it.
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.580]   And it's higher quality work.
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:15.460]   It's higher tech work.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:20.260]   No, I mean, think about it. The agricultural economy has collapsed, right?
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.500]   It employs no one, right?
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.060]   But you don't really think that agriculture has collapsed.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.140]   We grow more crops than we ever did.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.260]   I'm looking for the settings.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:31.620]   It's not activity.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.860]   In the higher the productivity, the fewer the people it takes to make the stuff.
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:36.420]   Excuse me.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:42.020]   My god, the average person in this country consumed more than the whole family did in the '40s.
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.780]   But so that would explain a higher unemployment.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:46.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.060]   So what is it?
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:51.220]   Give me a Mr. Science Fiction writer.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.900]   Give me a year of prognosis for the future.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:56.500]   What does the landscape look like 10, 15, 20 years ahead?
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.620]   Learn to be of service to people who are productive.
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.980]   Then what does that mean?
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.860]   It means that you're probably going to go back to having maids and valets.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.740]   All right.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:13.860]   You know what I want? I want somebody to iron my newspaper before I get it in the morning.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.580]   So I don't get here.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.620]   I wash your change on my hands and clean change.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:18.180]   Yep.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:18.660]   Thank you.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.940]   And you can also wash bills or mostly cotton.
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:27.700]   Well, you can have that choice or you can just pay them to stay out of your way with
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.820]   CalFresh, they call it nowadays.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:31.620]   It's going to be good.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.180]   What is that?
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:32.980]   Consuela.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:36.340]   CalFresh is the name for food stamps.
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.100]   It's a debit card that you get.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:41.860]   They call it CalFresh so you don't have to feel ashamed of yourself
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:45.620]   when you go in and get stuff off of food stamps.
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:48.100]   And of course, a lot of people have no choice.
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.460]   I mean, they have to live on it.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:56.180]   But what we're up to 40% of the people in California are on food stamps now.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.060]   Is that low?
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:57.380]   No.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:57.780]   Really?
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:58.500]   It's that high?
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.060]   It could be.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.020]   It wouldn't surprise me.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:00.660]   It's way up there.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.100]   The state is broke.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.980]   So that's why we're buying people's food.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.860]   Wow, somebody's got a duet.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.500]   Oh, they're having to have to have to have to.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.340]   You heard the CalFresh ads on...
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:10.820]   No.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:15.780]   ...and we're making vegetables in the pot they go and so forth.
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.060]   They're advertising for more people...
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:17.540]   In the pot.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.460]   Well, that's mostly LA advertising.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:23.860]   The CalFresh program formerly known as food stamps and federally known as the
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.100]   supplemental nutrition assistance program.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.900]   See, those feds, they don't know how to name stuff.
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:30.340]   Yeah, they're all snap.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:33.220]   That we call it CalFresh.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:34.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.220]   Yeah.
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.580]   They have back to tech news.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.020]   Making America stronger.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:38.980]   That's so right here.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.380]   Oh.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.740]   Well, it is tech news.
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:45.700]   You're going to have to figure out some way to keep people going when they're not needed.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:49.700]   So, if you're a young person heading, should you go to college, Jerry?
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.140]   Should shoot yourself apparently.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:51.620]   Apparently.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:52.660]   No.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:56.660]   Well, number one depends on what you want to do.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:02.660]   If I were a young person, well, my problem is I grew up smart.
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:06.500]   I understood that I really didn't want to be a plumber.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:06.820]   Right.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.180]   So, for that, you need education.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.900]   But you certainly don't need a college education to be an electrician or a plumber,
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.500]   or something of that sort.
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.500]   And those people always have jobs.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:23.060]   So, it would be a good idea to get a skill in a trade.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.980]   You don't need to go to college to get a skill rate.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.300]   Trades are great.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:25.620]   Trades are great.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.860]   You don't need to get any college skills in trade.
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.940]   Heck, you don't even need college to be a medium grade physicist.
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.700]   You know about the con lectures.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.020]   That's really true nowadays.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:41.060]   Although, good news in Minnesota, you can, in fact, take free classes from Coursera.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.100]   They reversed their test.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:42.660]   Oh, they did.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.580]   Because we were discussing that on the middle of a show.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:49.940]   Is that why, in Minnesota, they decided that because Coursera was not somehow accredited properly,
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:53.060]   that it was illegal to take a Coursera course.
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:53.540]   But you know what?
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.620]   People have said, "What are you crazy?"
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:56.980]   And they changed it right away.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.900]   Well, they could say, "What are you crazy?"
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:04.660]   But, in fact, there's a union that's going to keep trying to hold on to the certification process.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:10.260]   Because nowadays, what's expensive and not an education, you can get that online for free.
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:14.900]   It's getting a certificate that says you have the education that costs you the money
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.780]   and that puts you about $30,000 in debt.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:25.060]   Now, the notion that you have a middle class, every one of whom starts off with an enormous
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:28.260]   lifetime debt, is not something that condoms.
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:34.180]   I mean, that used to be known as being a bondsman and was not considered a very good idea back
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:36.340]   in the days of Republican theory.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.780]   And I mean, republic getting the sense of the old republic.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.660]   Lower case, sir.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:41.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:41.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.660]   Not a party.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:52.100]   Now, it's certification that costs money and there will come up a way of giving certification
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:54.020]   without costing $30,000.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.540]   Then you got something.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:56.660]   Yeah.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.620]   And that's one of the big things I see.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:05.620]   And that's one of the reasons why these tablets and iPads and that sort of thing are so interesting.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:09.060]   That's why Apple's pushing education in this iPad mini.
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.580]   Yeah, I accepted the specs on it as you point out.
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:17.300]   If it won't hold more than one textbook, that ain't the education tablet, is it?
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.260]   Well, but yeah.
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.340]   So obviously, you won't be able to get the low cost one.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.060]   You'll have to buy one.
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:25.300]   Well, are you going to have one that takes an SD card or something?
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.980]   What language are you making?
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:27.780]   Can't.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.620]   This thing has got too many variables.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.820]   I have made a couple of adjustments.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:33.460]   Oh dear.
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.340]   But nothing too drastic.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:40.260]   You know, this thing does things like it has a camera on the front and it looks at
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.700]   your eyes orientation.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.620]   So it rotates the screen to match your eyes.
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:48.020]   So if you're looking at it, it doesn't turn off the screen until you put it down.
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.860]   It does some very interesting things.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.780]   This is where innovation is happening.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.980]   In Korea.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:53.860]   Yes, exactly.
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.860]   All right.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:57.700]   There you go.
[00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.420]   Can Microsoft listen to your Skype calls?
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.020]   Forbes thinks it can.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:06.100]   We'll talk about that when we continue just a bit.
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:07.620]   I showed you what they want to as the question.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.580]   Brought to you by the United States Post Office.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.100]   What?
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.940]   No, I just thought I'd just get your...
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.100]   Just see what would happen.
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:19.540]   In a way it is because you post office loves stamps.com.
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:20.740]   I like stamps.com.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.460]   Who doesn't love the idea that special printer?
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:24.340]   I got a demo printer.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.140]   You got the whole thing?
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:25.860]   Oh yeah.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.020]   You don't need a special printer.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:28.980]   What are you nuts?
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:31.220]   You don't need a special printer.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:32.260]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:34.740]   You don't especially use your printer, your computer.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:35.940]   You print the mailing label.
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:36.820]   You print the stamps.
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:38.500]   You can even print on the envelope.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.620]   In fact, if you use...
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:44.100]   If you're an Amazon seller eBay Etsy PayPal, if you use QuickBooks,
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.340]   it'll take it from your address book.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:47.780]   It'll take the address.
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:48.900]   It'll take it from the website.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.900]   It'll put the stamp on there, put your logo on there.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:51.620]   The whole thing.
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:55.300]   This is kind of the 21st century post office.
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.140]   You never have to go to the post office again.
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:02.020]   Not just to buy stamps, but literally any package you...
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:05.860]   Mail of any size, the mail carry will come and pick it up.
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.500]   You can schedule free pickups or just use regular rounds.
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.100]   You get discounts.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.620]   You don't get it at the post office.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.900]   Up to 21% on Express mail, 15% on Priority mail.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.140]   If you do international mailing, you know what a pain that is
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:18.020]   to go to the post office.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.980]   You get to get the special international postage fill out the forms.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.260]   Stamps.com does that all.
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.940]   You do not go to the post office again.
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.100]   I am a big fan.
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:26.660]   We use it here.
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.700]   In fact, we love the free USB scale,
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:31.300]   so we end up getting two accounts.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:31.780]   Here's the deal.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:32.900]   Go to stamps.com.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.700]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:36.100]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:36.740]   I know you're going to say,
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.700]   "Hey, I need your dollar value."
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:41.620]   It's a pretty good $25 free postage, free scales, supplies, kit, fork.
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:43.220]   No, that's not good enough.
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:44.740]   That's not good enough for you.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:47.300]   Our esteemed listeners click the radio microphone
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.420]   in the upper right hand corner,
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:53.380]   and then use our offer code TWIT and go.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.900]   And it's not-- whoa, first of all, you get a great picture of me.
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.780]   Thank you, Tony Wang.
[00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:04.100]   Second of all, you get $110 bonus, $55 in free postage,
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.700]   a free digital scale.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.180]   You just pay shipping and handling, which is $5.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.580]   You then get a $5 supply kit to make up for that.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.540]   And a four-week trial at stamps.com.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:14.580]   This is a great deal.
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.300]   That USB scale really makes it perfect.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.900]   You always exactly the right postage.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.700]   You never have to guess.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.580]   Stamps.com, please do me a favor and do yourself a favor.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.300]   Try it free right now, especially if you do a lot of mailing
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.660]   if your eBay or Amazon or PayPal seller Etsy.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.260]   It does it all automatically.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:32.580]   Stamps.com.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:35.780]   It's terrifying and sickening.
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:40.900]   This actually came from Slate, Ryan Gallagher on Slate.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.300]   Let me go to Slate and show you this article.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.980]   And I'd like to know, maybe Dwight, if you understand this,
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:52.020]   new surveillance laws being proposed in the US and other countries like Australia
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:56.580]   would force makers of online chat software to build in backdoors for wiretapping.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:00.900]   Because law enforcement doesn't like it that you can use Skype and similar programs
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.460]   to make phone calls that they can't wiretap.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:08.020]   Skype has historically been a major barrier to law enforcement.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:11.620]   Police in Germany complained in 2007 they couldn't spy on Skype calls.
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:17.460]   Recently, however, hackers have alleged Skype has made a change to its architecture
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.220]   for lawful interception of calls.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:25.380]   Skype sent a comment to extreme texting, "No."
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.580]   The restructure was an upgrade and nothing to do with surveillance.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:34.340]   But Mr. Gallagher says when I repeatedly questioned the company on Wednesday,
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.060]   whether it could currently facilitate wiretap requests,
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.460]   a clear answer was not forthcoming, a non-denial,
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:44.180]   denial, citing company's policy, Skype PR man, Hayam Haas.
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:47.540]   What's PR guy?
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.860]   Wouldn't confirm or deny? Maybe he didn't. He's like, "I don't know. What is he talking about?
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.540]   Do you know? I cannot confirm or deny that at this time."
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:59.060]   Well, it's Microsoft. He did say.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.740]   Yeah. He doesn't know. No, he did say, "Well, on the code works."
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:08.180]   He said, "Skype cooperates with law enforcement agencies as much as as legally and technically
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.540]   possible." He didn't know you were right.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:16.580]   I don't know. Do you think Skype can, you know...
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.260]   Can't put it back, Dorian. It make it work.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.380]   I don't see why they wouldn't. I don't see why they haven't.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:24.180]   Exactly. I think you have to use Mumble.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.460]   What?
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.860]   Hit your own server and go back and forth on Mumble.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.020]   Is that safe? I think it is.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.500]   Is that because you're going through your own server?
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.540]   I think it's harder to...
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.460]   It's open source so we would know if there's anything in it going on.
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.700]   By the way, I saw this back there.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.740]   So you were having depth charges, apparently.
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:43.860]   Double depth charges at the then-
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.340]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:45.940]   In Las Vegas recently.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:47.700]   Double big straws in there.
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.220]   We actually had four or five of those glasses.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.100]   I don't know where the rest went.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:54.820]   I don't know, John.
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.060]   Why do you go through our stuff every time you're here?
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.580]   You've now got a giant bottle of Crown Royal and a giant glass from Beniana.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.140]   It is...
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.180]   Anything else I can get you?
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.500]   It's a plethora of props in this place.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.220]   I know! What are you...
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.100]   It's a studio!
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.660]   We like to keep stuff in here.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.580]   You know why they call it a scorpion?
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.420]   Oh, it's a scorpion line.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.620]   Because it stings.
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:16.180]   Well, they use better booze in it then.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:19.220]   So Leo, didn't Microsoft...
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:25.860]   Wasn't there a rumor years ago about windows having a back door in it for law enforcement?
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.260]   Oh, yes.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:26.980]   That where they could.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:27.540]   Yes.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.900]   And so, but whatever came of that, I don't remember it.
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.420]   Do you remember the NSA-DLL and all those things that used to be?
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:34.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.180]   It was a DLL called NSA.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:36.820]   Yeah, I believe so.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.100]   There's a couple of ways to hide it.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.460]   It has a couple of things like that.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.180]   I don't know what ever happened to that story.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.620]   So now that Microsoft owns Skype and Microsoft traditionally is...
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.620]   Microsoft is the man, right?
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:50.180]   You know, they're...
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.220]   Well, they wouldn't want to cooperate with law enforcement.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.260]   They wouldn't want to cooperate.
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:54.820]   Right.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:57.380]   So once you get hold of Skype, why don't you buy Skype?
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.940]   You know, don't you do what you need to do?
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.860]   What did you do, John?
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.500]   What is this?
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:09.860]   Are you really under the impression that you can have private telephone conversations
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.420]   without doing something like, as John says, your own private server?
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:17.300]   Probably not.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.100]   So mumbles.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:18.980]   I have never heard of this.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:19.700]   What is mumble?
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:23.780]   Mumble is an alternative to Skype that...
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.340]   Open source, low latency, high quality voice chat,
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.740]   primarily intended for gaming.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.260]   Yeah, a lot of gamers use this.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:30.980]   I've used this a lot.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:34.980]   So this is instead of those other things that gamers used to use that were right.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.060]   Right.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.540]   There's a whole team-speaking...
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.100]   Team-speaking.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.300]   Other things like that.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.780]   But this one's free, so you could put it on your own server.
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.700]   And if you're really an adept gamer, you normally have a gaming server anyway.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:46.180]   Anyway.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.060]   So why not throw it on there and then have a free service?
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.340]   Our producer, Chad Johnson, who is an expert in gaming.
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:56.020]   He does his own show on the network called OMG Craft, all about Minecraft.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.140]   OMG.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.260]   OMG Craft.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.620]   OMG Craft.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.420]   Well, his name is OMG Chad.
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.860]   It is?
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.580]   Legally, yeah.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.380]   It's on his driver's license.
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.580]   So have you used mumble chat?
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.300]   Yeah, we have.
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:09.780]   Now the-
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.580]   Does it sound good?
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:14.180]   The one downside is Skype does all of the setup for you.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:18.420]   Mumble, you go in and it's using Speaks as the audio codec.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:19.380]   Oh, I don't like Speaks.
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.340]   It's terrible codec.
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:24.820]   You have to tell it exactly where your voice ranges.
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.820]   They're moving to something called Opus, which is a newer.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.700]   Opus, everybody.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.620]   I think Skype is moving to Opus.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:34.340]   See, I would love it because Speaks is not a very good codec.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:37.300]   We tried it and it's been for only voice.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.900]   And it's not going to-
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.100]   It works fine with voice.
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.140]   No, it's a-
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.660]   I hear audible defects in it.
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:43.220]   I don't like it.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.820]   It's not-
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.860]   Skype works so well.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.380]   Listen, how good Jerry and Dwight sound.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.420]   They sound like they're in the room with it.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.300]   Sometimes you run into situations where it doesn't work as well as-
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:51.460]   Okay.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.100]   Mumble.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.420]   Yeah, if you have a lower quality bandwidth.
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:58.660]   This new code thing floating around with it called Opus or whatever.
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.300]   Opus, yeah.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.660]   Yeah, that's going to be-
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.780]   Picked up by everybody at Picked up.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.660]   Yeah, it looks like it's-
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.780]   It's obviously a government-
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:04.580]   It's not ETFs.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.380]   There's your government bottom.
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.580]   There's your back door right there.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.860]   It's in the codec.
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:10.580]   So to answer the question about security,
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:15.780]   I don't know if there's a way to encrypt your conversation in your rooms and your stream.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.540]   I don't know if that's built in.
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:18.900]   I haven't done any research on that.
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.140]   Anyway-
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.340]   Well, if you-
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.660]   Surprise, I found something you didn't know about.
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:25.140]   Want to use your own?
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:29.380]   If you want to use your own encryption engines,
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:34.980]   and you have a certain amount of control over the channels you're using,
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:39.060]   you can kind of count on a certain amount of privacy.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:42.580]   But if you just broadcast things,
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.220]   and that's what you're doing when you talk to the internet,
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.740]   you're putting it in the cloud,
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.820]   do you really think that it's private?
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.220]   If somebody really wants to listen to you?
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.620]   Yeah, with a lot of people who have podcasts,
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.540]   they'd hope to God they would be listening to,
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.460]   because nobody's listening to any of this stuff.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.500]   Exactly.
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.060]   Exactly.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.500]   No, but it is an issue.
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.300]   You know, I remember-
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:11.220]   who was it, former world chess champion who ran for president in Russia,
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.900]   would only do interviews via Skype,
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.420]   because he was very concerned about Putin.
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.140]   Casparov?
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:15.860]   It was Casparov.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.260]   He was very concerned about Putin's government listening in on it.
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.820]   Yeah, I talked to him by that.
[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:25.780]   He was part of the same group that were the people who did the handwriting program,
[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.820]   so I got to know him when I was in Russia.
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.740]   Super smart guy, very interesting guy.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.260]   Yeah, very, very interesting.
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:34.180]   But that's why he insisted on using Skype.
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.740]   But now I think he would probably not use Skype.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.900]   So I guess what we're just presuming that Microsoft-
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.540]   I don't- it's not that Microsoft's listening in,
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.620]   it's that Microsoft, if they were subpoenaed,
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.220]   would hand the keys over to law enforcement.
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:47.780]   Ah!
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.420]   Did the heartbeat.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.300]   No, heartbeat.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:49.860]   Here you go.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.700]   Why would they find it?
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:52.900]   No, they don't.
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:53.860]   They don't want to find it.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:56.260]   It's not in their interest.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.580]   It's an-
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:02.020]   Give them the keys and give them a coupon for a cheap Windows 8.
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:04.660]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.340]   So, um...
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.140]   Let's take a break.
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:10.580]   I'm just looking at the stories.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.900]   We've covered the Apple event, we've covered the Google event,
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.980]   we've covered the Microsoft Windows 8 launch.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.060]   We've covered our feelings about Windows 8.
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.660]   We haven't covered Huawei, have we?
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:19.300]   Or did you cover that?
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.300]   Huawei, let's talk about Huawei in just a bit.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:25.460]   Huawei, we haven't talked about, and we haven't talked about Newsweek going.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.700]   That's an amazing story, isn't it?
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:28.900]   Let's talk about that too.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.260]   With the old die-hard, inked stained wretches,
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:35.540]   this all three of you are inked stained wretches.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.180]   That's us.
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:36.740]   That's you.
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.340]   Yeah, well, that is us.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:41.380]   Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle,
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:44.660]   John C. Devorak from Channel Devorak in the No Agenda show,
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.220]   Jerry Pournell from Chaos Manor,
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:49.700]   and jerrypournell.com.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:50.980]   We're going to continue with Twittin' a bit,
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.140]   but first, since we do have a new device,
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.140]   we believe, coming from Apple,
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.980]   I'm going to give you the standard disclaimer.
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.940]   It's time to get a bid for your old iPad,
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:00.820]   just in case.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:01.860]   This is not a commitment.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:05.540]   Just in case you want to sell it and get the new one at Gazelle.
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:07.700]   Gazelle is great because it gives you 30-day quotes.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.740]   The quote is guaranteed good for the next 30 days,
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:14.100]   and I could promise you, when the new iPad comes out,
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.820]   that old iPad becomes much less valuable right out of the box.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.100]   You might as well get the quote now.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.540]   That's nice too, because what you could do is wait and see,
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.500]   if you like what Apple is talking about, you can order it,
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.740]   you can get it, you could transfer the data,
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.100]   you have 30 days to do all of that,
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.340]   and then send your iPad in, or whatever device you're selling,
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:32.980]   to Gazelle.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.740]   And by the way, Gazelle is great.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.500]   They will give you a check, they will give you a PayPal.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:44.740]   This is a 32 gig, 300 bucks for my 32 gig Wi-Fi plus 3G iPad too.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.500]   That's going to get me real close to the new iPad,
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.540]   if those numbers are right.
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:50.980]   You want the iPhone 5?
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:51.540]   No problem.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.660]   Let's take your iPhone 4S, AT&T.
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:58.340]   Let's, I got a 64 gig in good shape, 215 bucks.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.980]   Now you throw that in the box, anything worth more than a buck.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:04.180]   Gazelle will pay the postage, oh, and by the way,
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:06.900]   they even take broken iPhones.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.020]   So if the glass is cracked, or even if it just doesn't work,
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:10.900]   they will take it.
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:14.660]   1 million gadgets now have been traded at Gazelle.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:19.460]   They have paid over $50 million, or almost $50 million
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.140]   to over 300,000 customers.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.980]   They will send you a check,
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:28.180]   they will send you PayPal, or if you get an Amazon gift card,
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:33.300]   and I kind of like that, you'll get a 5% bonus on the amount they quoted you.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:37.540]   I guess they're rebating the Amazon affiliate fee probably.
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:38.980]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:43.780]   Look, just proactively go to Gazelle and get an offer for your stuff,
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.700]   because I can tell you one thing, no matter what it is,
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:52.100]   whether it's a Galaxy S3, a Galaxy Note, an iPad, it's not getting more valuable.
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.260]   They take Blackberries, too.
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:57.380]   Just not be curious what a Blackberry is worth.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:00.340]   These days can't be very much.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:07.140]   So Leo, I did this with my iPhone 4, and was really happy with it.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.460]   I had a 32 gig iPhone 4.
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:13.140]   Gazelle gave me 190 bucks for it.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:13.460]   Wow.
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:18.180]   That's almost all the way to an iPhone 5.
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:21.860]   Right, I wound up getting a 64 gig iPhone 5, so I ended up, you know,
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.020]   but I was very happy about it.
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:24.740]   Oh, that's good.
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.460]   And you got quick response, quick turnaround and all that.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:33.620]   Yep, and they let me do it for, I think for iPhone 5s at the time,
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:37.540]   they were giving 40 days out because the phone hadn't actually been announced yet.
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:43.460]   And what I really liked was that you don't have to send back the charger
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:44.500]   or the cable or anything.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.180]   You just put the phone in there.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.620]   Well, you can if you have it, though.
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:50.020]   Well, you can send it back if you want,
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.460]   but you know, you have another charger and they don't dock you for it.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:53.940]   Oh, they don't.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:54.500]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.100]   It was great.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.420]   Look, a Blackberry torch is worth 100 bucks.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:11:59.380]   Who would have thunk it?
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:11:59.940]   I wouldn't have.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:02.420]   Somebody called me on a radio show.
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:05.300]   Your advice, Gazelle, by the way, Gazelle.com.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.260]   There's no offer code.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.540]   Just use it.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.100]   Be happy.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.620]   Somebody called me on the radio show said, should I wait?
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:17.220]   I'd like your opinion, John C. Devorak, for a Blackberry 10 next year to come back.
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.420]   The Blackberry 10?
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.740]   Yeah, the OS 10 Blackberry.
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:21.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.180]   Should I wait?
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:22.660]   He said.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.420]   I think yes is the answer to that.
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:28.100]   Should he wait, Dwight?
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.420]   Yes.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:34.820]   Let's make it unanimous.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:35.940]   Should he wait, Jerry?
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.580]   Jerry fell asleep.
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.260]   Blackberry?
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:40.740]   What?
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:41.940]   Wait for the 12.
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:42.900]   Wait for the 12.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:43.860]   Those are good advice.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.620]   I told them, though.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.140]   There was a story.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:51.300]   The New York Times had a great story about Blackberry's not being cool anymore.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:55.300]   And the defensiveness of Blackberry users, it was full of great interviews.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.660]   And Blackberry and Miga.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.540]   I kind of feel bad.
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:01.060]   I, you know, until the iPhone came out, I was a major Blackberry guy.
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:04.100]   I used every single one starting with a pager with a keyboard.
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:04.740]   I loved it.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:05.940]   What happened?
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:06.660]   I did.
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.100]   I loved Blackberry too.
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:12.020]   Let me tell you a quick story about Comic Con in New York.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.700]   My son was there.
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:18.340]   He was providing the internet connectivity for the convention.
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.180]   That's what he does now.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.300]   Alex and--
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.340]   He does a great job, by the way.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.180]   I've used his connectivity at CES.
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.140]   And it's fantastic.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.420]   We used it as showstoppers.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:31.540]   Yeah, he does showstoppers.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.260]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:38.260]   Well, he was telling me that at one point in Comic Con just a week ago,
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:44.340]   the only telephone connectivity anybody had from the Javits from--
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:51.140]   the Javits Center was a LTE from iPhone 5.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.540]   There was no 4s.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.020]   Nobody was getting through on anything else.
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:14:02.820]   Just plain iPhone 5 LTE was getting connectivity and nobody else was.
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:07.060]   I am a big fan of Verizon's LTE.
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:07.460]   I'm not.
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.900]   Why not?
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.300]   My wife, because they're billing--
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.180]   That's this.
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:12.580]   That--
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:13.380]   Well, there you have it.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:15.300]   You don't even know it's in your own place.
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.660]   Dave's coffee syrup.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.300]   Yeah, it was a refrigerator.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.460]   Actually, this is quite good.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.620]   So my wife joined a family plan with Verizon.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:27.860]   We got a bunch of phones and a couple of phones crapped out.
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.220]   They wouldn't replace them.
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.100]   The amount that they bill them every month is totally different
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.540]   and not what was promised.
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:38.500]   My wife is actually going to pay the $500 to get out of the contract.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.700]   The early termination fee.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:45.700]   She's willing to pay that because of the scam pricing that Verizon does.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.660]   I would never subscribe to anything for--
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.460]   She's going back to T-Mobile because they got her some pretty good deals.
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:55.220]   Having said that, the LTE is really fast.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.020]   Great.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:56.900]   Fantastic.
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.820]   Here, give me your wallet.
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:14:59.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:04.180]   I didn't say it was cheap, but it was the only thing working.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.020]   T-Mobile?
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:10.660]   No, T-Mobile is what we're going to because we can't afford it.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:11.220]   Really?
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.460]   Yeah, because it's just everything because--
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.460]   Well, everyone knows about the AT&T,
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:19.300]   Bogative pricing, but the Verizon is worse apparently.
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.060]   She's an organization.
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:22.020]   I don't know how that's a sprint.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:24.340]   He likes the pretty girl on the edge.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:25.300]   Oh, that's it.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.980]   That girl on the motorcycle.
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.220]   One, two, three, four.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.100]   That's the sprint one.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.060]   Oh, you got the X-girl.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:31.620]   X-girl.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.180]   AT&T.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:34.340]   The thing for what's the corrosion.
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.300]   What about AT&T?
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:42.260]   AT&T at least allows you, if you're unlimited and you get an LTE phone,
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.860]   you can keep your unlimited plan.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:48.420]   Yeah, they'll probably get five, but you can keep your unlimited plan.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:49.860]   Verizon won't let you do that.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:53.380]   And AT&T hasn't done away with its regular tiered plans.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.340]   If that's what you prefer, if you don't want to do the shared data.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:16:00.180]   So looking at the way AT&T has things structured,
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:03.620]   I think they actually are being more fair to their customers
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.140]   than Verizon is.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:07.140]   Although Verizon does have a great network.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:10.100]   But sprints the last one with unlimited data, right?
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.820]   Yeah, but it's really what it's crappy.
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:13.540]   So who cares?
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:16.660]   I'm disappointed to hear that the 4G's not good.
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.260]   We're getting sprint 4G too.
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.220]   Is it new?
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:20.260]   Has it been rolled out?
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.820]   Or maybe you're just using the pre-rewarded?
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.660]   No, it's rolled out.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:28.500]   Houston is one of the cities where they rolled it out on day one.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:29.300]   Why is it bad?
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.780]   Because the same thing with Clearwire, their earlier 4G, the YMAX, was terrible.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:37.780]   It's spotty in that you could be on one tower that has it.
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:39.780]   I mean, downtown Houston is a good example.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.540]   You can be on one tower that has it.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:46.580]   You walk a couple of blocks and it's gone, or it has dropped dramatically in speed.
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:55.300]   The way Verizon and AT&T rolled it out is they got it in most of the center of the town,
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:57.460]   most of the center of the large cities.
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:00.260]   And then they made sure it was working right and they lit it up.
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:05.380]   But the impression I get from sprint is that they rushed it and they're getting it up
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.980]   because they're so far behind.
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:10.020]   They're just getting something up, anything up, and then they're tuning as they go.
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:15.300]   Well, maybe a soft banks acquisition and pouring $20 billion into them will help.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:17.060]   That might probably help.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:17.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.860]   It's likely to help a lot.
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:23.220]   Now, think soft bank is crazy.
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.580]   Crazy like a fox.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:33.940]   You know, I'm thrilled because what we don't want is what we almost had with AT&T acquiring
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:38.500]   T-Mobile and sprint would have then gone away and we'd have two phone companies,
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:41.380]   both of whom are not great.
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:43.940]   At least we have some competition.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:47.940]   And you know, these younger, more nimble companies like Boost and
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.900]   they're kind of interesting.
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:55.700]   Well, by the way, El Franken had a lot to do with the queering that deal.
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:56.500]   Thank you, El Franken.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:56.980]   Really?
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.740]   Senator.
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:01.460]   You've got something good to say for El Franken.
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:04.420]   Well, he has been going after the telecom companies.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:07.060]   I mean, I know what you're thinking.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.020]   What am I thinking?
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.060]   No, Jerry.
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.180]   I know what Jerry's thinking.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.660]   And that's actually pretty tasty.
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:13.620]   It's coffee syrup.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:15.220]   Half quart.
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:16.020]   Half quart of it.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:16.900]   That goes a long way.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.580]   You probably don't want to drink the whole aisle.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:22.100]   But he does a pretty good job of standing up to the telecom companies,
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.860]   unlike anybody else in the Senate.
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:28.420]   You know, I wonder if he's getting campaign contributions from them.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.060]   Because I know they're--
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:29.780]   I would think not.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:32.740]   He's got a ton of money going in there.
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:36.180]   Now, Jerry, you brought up two good stories.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.740]   Let's start with Huawei, which is the Chinese.
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:42.580]   Apparently, this Chinese phone company, Chinese electronics company,
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.900]   has ties to the Chinese military.
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:48.980]   And a commission that had been studying this for a few months
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.260]   from the Department of Commerce, I think it was Department of Commerce,
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:56.340]   the US government anyway, said, "No Huawei phones for anybody in government."
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:57.860]   We could tell you that right now.
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:03.060]   But it seemed that they were more concerned about industrial espionage
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.420]   than military espionage.
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:07.220]   They were worried about intellectual property being stolen
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.820]   by people using Huawei phones.
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.340]   Well, it wasn't just the phones.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:11.540]   It was mostly the switches.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.940]   And also the 4G network.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.420]   Right.
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:18.660]   But there was nothing in any of those things where there was any hard evidence.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.180]   It was all there.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:22.980]   They are ties with Chinese military.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.940]   They have these components in critical infrastructure.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:28.020]   And the X could happen.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.980]   But there was no evidence that the X had happened.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:35.220]   No, but when you listen to the C-SPAN had some of these hearings,
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:39.060]   and when you listen to this stuff, it was apparent that what they were accusing
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:43.300]   Huawei of doing was what we can already do.
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.620]   I mean, you could just tell that they were projecting.
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.060]   I don't know that way.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.620]   You do this, so we assume the Chinese are doing.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.220]   And I would assume so too.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.900]   And then they did have some hard evidence about some stuff some years ago,
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:55.860]   not in the United States.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:00.260]   But it was just they just don't want switching gear from China.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.140]   Like, does that make sense?
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:02.020]   In this country.
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:03.300]   This was by the way of correction.
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.220]   It is a national security issue.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.860]   It was the House Intelligence Committee, and that makes more sense.
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:08.660]   This is...
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:17.780]   And they were concerned also about ZTE, which is another Chinese company.
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.180]   Yeah, ZTE has actually tried to...
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:23.140]   I've never heard of them before these hearings,
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.300]   but they're apparently trying to worm their way out of this
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:30.180]   and trying to get into the good graces of the intelligence committee.
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.780]   Huawei, I don't think has a prayer.
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:34.980]   The report says China has the means, opportunity, and motive
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.740]   to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:42.020]   based on available classified and unclassified information.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:45.860]   Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence,
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:47.780]   and thus pose a security threat to the United States.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:50.900]   Yeah, and the head of Huawei is the secretive guy.
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:51.780]   He used to be in the government.
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.740]   He used to be in the military.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.740]   Never with those interviews.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.260]   It's just a bad situation.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:21:00.980]   But is it every single phone we use made in China?
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:02.100]   That's the irony.
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.460]   Somebody said, "What about the iPhone?
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:04.260]   It's made in China.
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.300]   Everything's made in China."
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:10.900]   I mean, I think this is more about the 4G networks and the people...
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:14.900]   We apparently can trust Ericsson more than we can trust the Chinese.
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.180]   We're freaked out about it.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:18.020]   So that doesn't bother me.
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:21.140]   I think if you presume that the Chinese government
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:24.260]   are influencing Chinese companies,
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:26.660]   you might as well presume they're influencing Foxconn
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:28.020]   and everybody else, Pecotron,
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:32.260]   is making all the gear you see in front of you today is made in China.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.900]   Now, I presume if there were a listening device in there,
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:35.860]   hello?
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:36.420]   Somebody...
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:36.820]   Hello?
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.860]   Somebody...
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:38.660]   Hi, listen.
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:39.460]   Somebody would have noticed.
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:40.420]   No, somebody would have noticed.
[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:40.500]   Somebody would have noticed.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:40.500]   Somebody would have noticed.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:40.500]   Somebody would have noticed.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.540]   Somebody would have noticed.
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:42.180]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.380]   Somebody would have noticed.
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.500]   But why not in the switches?
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.260]   I mean, can't we tell if it's phoning home?
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.740]   Well, it seems to be...
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:49.700]   More complicated.
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.820]   It's a rough go.
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.220]   Better just to...
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:56.580]   She stayed with Cisco and Ericsson and Alcatel and we're...
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:00.100]   But isn't much of Cisco made in China?
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.660]   Yeah, everything's made in China.
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:03.700]   Yeah, but Cisco...
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:04.580]   Is it a chip?
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.580]   Yeah, but Cisco's specking out most of the...
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.820]   Your hip replacement is made in China.
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:09.300]   Most...
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.340]   And it's listening now.
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:17.220]   The Cisco main networking chips are pretty much designed by Cisco
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.740]   and I don't think that they're...
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.100]   And they have the tape outs.
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:24.900]   I don't think that the Chinese are throwing back doors into Cisco products.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.460]   Steve, have you ever considered coffee flavored sangria?
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.380]   That is...
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.740]   Leo, you're going to make us all sick.
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:33.060]   It's horrible.
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.220]   It's kind of like a speedball.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:37.220]   I wouldn't know.
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:41.380]   As a science fiction writer, I think about things like
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:44.420]   communications Pearl Harbor day.
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.860]   Yes.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:50.980]   How hard would it be to shut down every router in the United States if you built them?
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:55.140]   Well, your president, Obama, wants to have a kill switch.
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:56.100]   My president?
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.220]   At your president.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.820]   At his disposal.
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:22:59.300]   Our president.
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:00.260]   He's your president.
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:04.580]   He wants to have the kill switch at his disposal so he can pull it and do exactly what you said.
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:05.860]   What is his status to that, by the way?
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.860]   I probably has it.
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.020]   It's probably a big ring of his body.
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:10.820]   My assuming has it.
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:11.380]   It says...
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.860]   But that was in case of cyber warfare and in fact,
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.900]   I'll tell you what's really vulnerable is the grid.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:20.740]   And it's all running on gearmaking China.
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.420]   And it's all highly vulnerable, I think.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:28.660]   In fact, as I seem to remember, the reports showed that many
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:36.180]   of our privately owned power companies had infested hardware on premises.
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:36.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:39.620]   Well, hey.
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.540]   Well, how come something hasn't happened?
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:42.500]   Forget the switches.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.620]   Just turn off the power.
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:44.580]   They won't work either.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.020]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.380]   I think you're right.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.620]   I think a Pearl Harbor day would be quite a wake up call.
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.140]   Meanwhile, good news.
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:56.980]   Best buy is going to be offering the Nokia Lumion 920 and the HTC 8X for $149,
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:01.380]   $999, $999, $999, respectively under contract.
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.700]   So don't worry about the Chinese.
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.060]   You can get cheap phones.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.180]   Yeah, that's all it counts.
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:08.340]   Best price.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:09.700]   Forget the cyber warfare.
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:10.740]   We got cheap phones.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:14.500]   Okay.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:15.940]   Well, that put a crimp in the action.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:17.140]   Well, I just pointing it out.
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:17.540]   That's all.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.740]   What was the other topic?
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.740]   What was the other topic that you might have mentioned, Jerry,
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:21.620]   that was also good?
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:22.580]   We were Huawei and...
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.500]   Newsweek.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:24.980]   Newsweek.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:25.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:25.940]   Newsweek.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:27.300]   So at the end of the year,
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.140]   Newsweek will print its last print edition,
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:31.380]   almost 100 years old as a Newsweek-ly.
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.060]   They're going all digital.
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:35.940]   I don't understand why they didn't get to the 100-year mark and kill it then.
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.620]   It's a little more interesting.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:42.580]   I guess this is where we're headed, right?
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:44.340]   I mean, it's all digital or...
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:49.220]   What do you think, Jerry?
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.740]   I don't know.
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:51.540]   Is the death of print?
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:51.860]   I'm...
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.740]   Death of Newsweek.
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:59.860]   It depends entirely, I think, on how good the tablets are as they get better.
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:05.540]   Right now, it's pretty hard to read out in the sunlight.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:09.060]   Well, if you have a paper white, it works pretty well.
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.260]   Do you know Kindle's work fine?
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:11.060]   Kindle's work fine.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:14.020]   You can't read some light from the store.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:15.700]   The paper white is good indoors.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.180]   You have one?
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:16.900]   I really like it.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:20.020]   I-S has one, and it really was nice.
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:20.980]   It was beautiful.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:22.100]   He's not here right now, sir.
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:25.620]   In New Zealand, it was founded in 1933.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.860]   Well, they'd have a ways to go.
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:30.100]   It was the big rival to Tom.
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:33.300]   And Washington Post owned it for a long time.
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:38.340]   Circulation in the 2000s was around $3 million,
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:43.220]   but by 2008, it declined to $1.8 million.
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:44.180]   Holy crap.
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:45.540]   Still a lot.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:46.980]   Yeah, that's from the land.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:48.340]   That sold it for $1.
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:52.580]   The interesting story is that is Sidney Harmon.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.620]   Who bought them in 2010 for a dollar.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:58.820]   Well, it's more complicated than that.
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.380]   A dollar, and he assumed $47 million in debt.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:03.140]   Yeah, so he bought them for $47 million.
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.820]   $47 million in $1.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:11.140]   He was a multi-millionaire stereo and car navigation equipment mogul.
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:12.660]   Never published a thing in his life.
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:18.260]   Tina Brown joined almost immediately.
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:20.900]   Harmon died the next year.
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:22.020]   Huh.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.460]   Circulation continued to slip as of June of this year,
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.460]   $1.57 million.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:31.780]   So it's time, I guess.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.820]   The editor of Newsweek says this is an opportunity.
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.180]   This is not the end of Newsweek.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.060]   It's just the beginning.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:40.260]   It's just the beginning.
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:41.220]   Just the beginning.
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:43.140]   The beginning of a college slide.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.140]   It got very weird over the last year.
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.100]   If I were a subscriber, I would have stopped.
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:49.380]   Well, what was weird about it?
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:50.420]   It covers everything.
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:53.060]   They were becoming very sensationalistic.
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.460]   Yeah, the Obama's gay cover.
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.580]   Yeah, that was very strange.
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:57.300]   I thought so.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:04.580]   So I wonder how a lot of this has to do with just the news cycle for News Weekly.
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:05.780]   It's too long.
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:06.820]   It's too long.
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:07.540]   I'm curious.
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.260]   I wonder how healthy time in and of itself is,
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:12.100]   not necessarily the company,
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.860]   but is time in the same position?
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:14.500]   I think so.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.540]   That Newsweek was.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:16.020]   They have to be.
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:22.580]   I think that going digital is probably the way the headline on it was right.
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:23.940]   It does liberate them.
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:25.940]   It allows them to do what they want to do.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:29.700]   The question is, is there so much digital journalism out there
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:33.060]   of varying qualities, what can they do to stand out at this point?
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:35.860]   Time magazine, 3.3 million subscribers.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.980]   So it's doing much better.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:42.180]   They can't manage to make money online because the model is so alien.
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:46.180]   I mean, with a little magazine, they sell these full page ads
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.180]   and people thumb through them and they see these ads.
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:50.020]   The online thing is nothing like that.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.820]   The whole model for selling advertising online is completely...
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.660]   It's almost impossible.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:58.260]   As Adam Curry pointed out, you're taking what was a scarce resource,
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:02.900]   print ads, and trying to assign the same value to an infinite resource,
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:03.700]   banner ads.
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:04.100]   Right.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.380]   And you can't do it.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.420]   The math doesn't work.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:06.740]   Life.
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:09.140]   Infinite resource is not as valuable as a scarce resource.
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:10.340]   You know, he just became a ham.
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.140]   He's a smart man.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.020]   He got his license.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:12.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.780]   We should all be afraid.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:18.260]   No, but when the end times thing, everybody out there should know that if you can get...
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.300]   I've got...
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:19.700]   It's easy.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:22.100]   If Adam can do it, if you can do it, if I can do it...
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.220]   Any idiot can do it.
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:24.660]   Now is he a technician or is he general?
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:25.700]   He's going for general.
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.260]   He's going for general.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.700]   He's trying to get people out there to...
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:30.660]   Everybody should be a ham.
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:33.860]   It's a second wave of ham.
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.740]   And if you want to be a ham, you should watch our show Ham Nation,
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:40.180]   which is all about the art and science of amateur radio.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:42.020]   It's a fabulous show Ham Nation.
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:43.700]   Every Wednesday, 6 p.m.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.420]   Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern on the Twit Network.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:51.940]   That actually is quite relevant to what we were talking about with Newsweek.
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:57.220]   Don't you think that what's doomed is the big general purpose magazine?
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:00.020]   Go niche, you're saying.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:00.580]   Go niche.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.340]   Yeah, well, look at it.
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.500]   Niche, for me, is my income now.
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.300]   My backlist is selling on Amazon Kindle like crazy.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:17.700]   I'm making more money out of my backlist than I used to make from bite.
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:20.820]   Here is a graph.
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:24.820]   And I'm selling through, selling about a thousand books a month of one kinder,
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:27.300]   another, some of them 40 years old.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.900]   And they're doing very well.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:32.020]   People read them, they like them, and they throw them away, I guess.
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.860]   I think...
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:34.740]   Probably keep them.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:41.620]   But the point is that there are other people, my friends of mine,
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:46.100]   who never had many readers, but they have enough.
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:51.300]   And they couldn't get big publishers to pay attention to them
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:55.860]   because they didn't have enough readers to go out and you see what I mean.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.060]   I think there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.180]   We're a niche broadcaster.
[01:29:58.180 --> 01:29:59.620]   I think it's a niche broadcaster.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:00.020]   Right.
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:05.780]   What's happening is that publishing is going to be a very large number of niches.
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:07.300]   Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.860]   It's the same thing happening in music.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:11.300]   It's the opposite of wrong.
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:12.660]   That was fantastic.
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:13.380]   Look at music.
[01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:17.620]   The platinum multi-million sellers are probably going away,
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:18.660]   but that means a lot more...
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:19.620]   You mean like Madonna?
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.100]   Like Madonna, like Metallica, but a lot more...
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:23.380]   They're bringing in all the big dough.
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.700]   Well, they are still, but I think over time,
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:28.660]   what it's going to mean is a more democratization of music,
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.100]   the democratization of media.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:32.820]   It's very different between performances and records.
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:38.580]   One of the problems with the recording industry was that the recording industry was so rapacious.
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:39.380]   Well, yeah.
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:40.340]   They killed themselves.
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:40.820]   I agree.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:42.740]   I think artists began telling people,
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:47.220]   "Please go pirate my stuff because the publisher doesn't give me any money."
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:49.780]   You saw the 60 minutes the other night.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:58.420]   The guy who was the most popular singer in South Africa for years,
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:30:59.860]   and he never knew it.
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:00.740]   Yeah, he's penniless.
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:04.260]   His publisher collected all that money,
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:09.300]   and that he was bothered to tell him he was selling half a million records a year in South Africa.
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.180]   You know what's kind of telling?
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:13.460]   Madonna's current record deal is not with a record company.
[01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:15.540]   It's with their concert promoters, with Live Nation.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:18.020]   Then in fact, that's where the money is.
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.780]   She has a deal to make a certain number of albums and tour behind each of them.
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.820]   And the money, I'm sure,
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.780]   given how much I spend on a ticket, is in the performance.
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:26.820]   How much is it spent on a ticket?
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:27.620]   700 bucks.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:27.940]   What?
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:29.940]   Well, that's how you get those...
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:30.980]   Oh my God.
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:34.340]   Hey, I got a laminate and a program and a t-shirt.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.220]   Holy moly.
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:36.660]   They gave me a little prime rib.
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:36.660]   Whoa.
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:40.660]   You're paying that, St. Madonna.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.380]   Did you get...
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:43.860]   You should have got a lot more for $7.
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:44.980]   Yeah, I got a great...
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:49.380]   No, look, I'm telling you, I paid $450 to see you too.
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.580]   If you want to get good seats at a big concert...
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:53.860]   $50 to see me?
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:54.260]   You too.
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:58.180]   If you want to get first...
[01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.860]   It's expensive to go to concerts,
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.940]   but there's a lot of production in there.
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:03.140]   How much was...
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.220]   How much was love?
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.460]   I think it was probably 300, 400 bucks.
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:08.020]   It was expensive.
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:10.500]   You're spending a lot on them?
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.540]   I'm on the 1%.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.180]   Screw you.
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:13.300]   Yeah, I was.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:14.100]   Screw you.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.380]   Errington, you heard him.
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:20.020]   But you see, you have your niche, and we have ours.
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:24.180]   Nobody's going to pay $700 to see me talk.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:24.660]   Right.
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:29.780]   But maybe 700 people will pay a dollar to buy a copper.
[01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.060]   My book this week.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.300]   Not bad.
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:35.060]   So, Leo, what I found...
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:38.420]   Did you have covered this in an earlier tweet?
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:40.740]   But Marco Armin's magazine...
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.260]   Now that I don't get it all.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:43.060]   Okay, tell us about that.
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:43.860]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:44.660]   That I do not get.
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:49.620]   Marco Armin is quite popular among Mac fanatics.
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:52.020]   He created an app called InstaPaper.
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:54.580]   It started as a website, and it later became an app.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:56.660]   Free website, he charged for the app.
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:06.020]   And he has a blog that's extremely popular among a certain small group of mostly Mac fans.
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:07.220]   Marco.org.
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.020]   Marco.org.
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:11.060]   He talks about technology, coffee, and InstaPaper.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:16.180]   He decided to take articles from his blog and others
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.900]   and make something called The Magazine.
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:20.180]   It's an iOS app.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:21.620]   Very simple.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.780]   It's not glossy or glitzy.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:25.220]   It's pretty much like InstaPaper.
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:26.580]   It's clean text.
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:30.100]   I think it's four articles twice a month, something like that.
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:35.780]   I'm Marco Armin, creator of InstaPaper, technology writer, and coffee enthusiast.
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:36.180]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:37.300]   We should send him his bottle.
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.060]   He's kind of a coffee snob, to be honest.
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:39.860]   Oh, he's a coffee.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:40.820]   Yeah, he wouldn't like this.
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:43.460]   So here's why this is interesting.
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:45.220]   He does a podcast too over at 5x5.
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:46.980]   So this is why...
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:48.020]   This is interesting.
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:49.700]   Nobody listens to 5x5.
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:53.700]   This is the one guy who is both a programmer,
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:55.380]   and he's interested in writing.
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:59.060]   He got Jason Snell, among others, to write from the initial interview.
[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:00.660]   Editor, editorial director of writing.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:02.660]   He called him $1.99.
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:06.500]   It cost you $1.99 a month, I think, for this.
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:08.420]   It's only four stories.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:09.380]   It's four stories.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:09.860]   Right.
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:10.420]   Right.
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.100]   Four stories in each issue.
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:15.780]   And he's essentially a staff of one.
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:20.500]   He will probably make a really decent amount of money doing this.
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.740]   And it's a minimal effort.
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:25.540]   And he has a Ruby piece and a amount of money.
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.140]   $100 million.
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:29.700]   That's not how much he's going to make.
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:30.740]   Oh, I don't know how he's going to make.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.020]   But he'll probably sell 10...
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:33.300]   I would guess $10,000...
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.140]   $20,000 a month.
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:37.060]   As much as...
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.660]   I'll sell $20,000 a month.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:40.180]   Adam makes from his same degree.
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:40.980]   A week.
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:41.300]   A week.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:42.420]   Sure.
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:47.060]   I mean, you know, Apple takes 30% of that $1.99.
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.260]   So he...
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:49.300]   You know, he...
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:51.620]   In terms of his publishing and distribution is nothing.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.740]   It's that 30%.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:54.340]   He's written the code...
[01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:55.940]   He's making 14 grand a month.
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:56.340]   That's...
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:56.900]   Probably.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:57.380]   Right.
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:57.860]   Right.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:59.300]   For very little work.
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:00.660]   For very little work.
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:01.220]   But...
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:04.740]   And to me, if you're a publisher and...
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.820]   Or you're a name, I mean, Leo,
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:10.500]   suppose you did something like this and put this out
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:11.860]   and it was a minimal amount of work,
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:14.260]   you could make a decent amount of cash in print.
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:15.300]   You know, for some reason,
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:16.900]   I've always resisted this kind of thing.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.100]   This is your next stage.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:19.140]   No, I don't want to do this.
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:19.620]   Okay, good.
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:21.540]   I don't know why.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:22.740]   I mean, it's completely legitimate.
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:23.140]   Everybody...
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.580]   It's not like you're ripping people off.
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:25.620]   People know what they're getting.
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.380]   That's what I do.
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:28.180]   It's...
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:30.500]   Yeah, but you don't have a podcast and you're not...
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.180]   A podcasting.
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:32.820]   You're not a...
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:33.460]   Then they've got...
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:34.260]   Here's my fear.
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:35.060]   I think that...
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:38.980]   You don't want people to think you're trying to
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:41.780]   get as much money as you can out of them.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:42.660]   They already know that.
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:46.180]   But in $1.99, that's not an issue.
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:47.700]   You're just a $1.99.
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.740]   I guess I could do it.
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:49.380]   Yay!
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:50.260]   Yay!
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.220]   I was going in the print.
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:51.860]   No.
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:54.500]   But I think the bottom line on this is that...
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.140]   I'm gonna plug that guy.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.660]   Let me plug me.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:57.700]   Please plug yourself.
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:58.500]   Chaos Manor.
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:59.060]   That's a...
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:02.260]   I mean, you know, my site is free.
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:04.100]   I use the public radio model.
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:05.700]   You don't people donate?
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:06.420]   But I'm doing.
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:07.460]   Send me down.
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:08.340]   Subscribe.
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:11.380]   ChaosManaReviews.com, if people want to know more.
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:13.940]   Thousands of subscribers.
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:16.500]   Jerry's writing, not just sci-fi writing,
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.180]   but Jerry's technology writing
[01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:20.500]   is what inspired me to get in this business.
[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.700]   Because ChaosMana in bite,
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:25.940]   the original ChaosMana column in bite,
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:28.500]   was the first time I'd ever read technology coverage
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.620]   written as a user from the experience of a user.
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:33.780]   Like, this is what it was like to use this.
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:36.020]   This is what I had to do to get it working.
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:37.700]   And it really inspired me to say,
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:40.020]   "This is what technology coverage should be.
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.980]   It shouldn't be regurgitation of press releases.
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:44.740]   It shouldn't be, ain't this stuff great?
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:46.900]   It should be, here's what it's like to be a user."
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.300]   And so I honor you, Jerry,
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.180]   and you deserve to continue to make a good living on ChaosMana.
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.860]   ChaosManaReviews.com.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:55.300]   And you're still doing it.
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:56.660]   Still doing it.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.820]   Haven't posted much recently,
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:01.060]   but I own the Jerry Pronel site.
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:04.100]   I get something up every day or two.
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:05.220]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:07.380]   Boy, if I could get it up every day or two, I'd do it.
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.340]   Now you're talking.
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:10.580]   That's what she said.
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.860]   That's no, always been my problem,
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.220]   is I don't want to write so much.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:13.940]   It's too much work.
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:14.740]   I like talking.
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:15.300]   It's easy.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:16.740]   Why don't you talk and have a transcribed?
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:18.900]   It's easy for you to talk.
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.260]   It's easy for me to write.
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:20.740]   Exactly.
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:21.700]   You're a great writer,
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.100]   and writing comes naturally to you.
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:24.980]   For me, it's talking.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:26.420]   That's why I'm not doing them publication.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:27.220]   I'm doing podcasts.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:28.420]   I'm a dual-assretch.
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:29.140]   All day, every day.
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.340]   I'm a dual-assretch.
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:31.940]   You have a better voice than I do.
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:33.380]   It's actually a...
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:35.860]   But the motto, I think,
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:38.820]   the note of this is that niche publishing
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:40.260]   is the way to go.
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:42.180]   Not a mass news magazine,
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:45.220]   but a targeted niche publication,
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:47.300]   or podcast, or whatever.
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.540]   And I think that...
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:53.220]   You know, our motto always here
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:54.820]   was not to get bigger, but to get better.
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:57.540]   You know, traditionally business is about grow it.
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.020]   What do you know?
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.620]   I'm not shoveling anything here.
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:01.940]   By the way, they changed the cottage name
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:02.980]   to Conkran Cottie.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:03.300]   I know.
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:04.500]   Somebody else took that over.
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:05.940]   By the way, when I was driving over here,
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.860]   I went past the open door church,
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:08.740]   which you've seen up there.
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:09.460]   Yeah, it's a wonderful place.
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:10.020]   You know what?
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:10.340]   What?
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.460]   The door was open.
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:12.660]   Yeah, it's an open door church.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.060]   Wild.
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:14.500]   Anybody can go in there, even you.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.980]   Let's see what's coming up on the week ahead.
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:17.780]   I gotta take a break.
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:18.500]   I gotta take a break.
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:19.540]   Let's see what's coming up.
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:19.860]   What effect...
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.740]   Here's what we're gonna do.
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:21.700]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:22.180]   What?
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:23.460]   Is Tom Merritt here?
[01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:25.140]   Tom Merritt is, I think,
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:27.300]   just over on the other side of the wall there.
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:28.340]   Tom, what's going on?
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:29.540]   Hey, thanks Leo.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.060]   Here's some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.820]   in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:34.820]   Coming up Monday, October 22nd,

[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:38.900]   That's a mobile payment system.
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:41.380]   Also, Yahoo and new CEO,
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:43.460]   Marissa Myers have their earnings called.

[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.380]   Netflix has their earnings call,
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.140]   and wait a minute,
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:58.420]   it's the fifth robot Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:00.420]   Wait, is there something else on October 23rd?
[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:02.740]   Oh yeah, Apple has some kind of announcement.
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:04.420]   iPod mini or iPad mini.
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:05.540]   Maybe it'll be an iPod mini.
[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:06.180]   Who knows?
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.620]   Wednesday, October 24th,
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.740]   earnings calls from AT&T as well as Zynga.

[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:28.260]   Apple reveals their fourth quarter earnings result.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:32.020]   The Amazon Kindle Fire HD 32 gigabyte goes on sale.
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:35.780]   And the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 coming to Sprint for $300.
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:38.260]   Of course, Friday, October 26th is the day Windows 8

[01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:50.820]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:51.540]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:56.740]   Hey, so Tom,
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:58.660]   so I cut this book,
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:39:59.940]   there's a couple of these books floating around,
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:00.740]   one of them.
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:01.780]   This is Tom's new book.
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:03.220]   The chronology of tech is?
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:05.380]   Yeah, he left on Lancaster out.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:06.340]   Who's Don Lancaster?
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:07.620]   Yeah, look him up.
[01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:09.780]   See us kids, we don't know those things.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:11.940]   So young people today.
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:14.660]   This is, he wrote little things to people.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.380]   Jason, don't tell the others I gave you this book.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:19.220]   Kind of a thing.
[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:20.420]   He doesn't have any copies.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:21.620]   I didn't get one.
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:23.060]   Well, don't tell anyone.
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:25.140]   But Jason got one.
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:25.620]   Jason.
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:26.820]   Then he has one for Sarah,
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.100]   which I was looking for,
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:28.900]   he's got little things.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:31.620]   He says, "Sarah, I know you're never going to read this,
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:34.020]   but I had an extra copy."
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:36.980]   So he's just throwing these books out there.
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:38.820]   No, this is, I think you can get this on Amazon.
[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.020]   The chronology of tech history,
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:41.540]   it's Tom's merit's newest book,
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.220]   and it's mostly true.
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:47.220]   Well, he left CNET out of the chronology, by the way.
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:51.060]   You and I have some history there with that CNET story.
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:51.860]   Yes.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:54.500]   But that's another day, another time, another story.
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:58.580]   No, so the deal is, the coffee gives it a rich,
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.580]   did you taste it?
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:02.020]   It's got a robustness.
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:02.900]   The problem was to agree,
[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:04.820]   it's sometimes thin and kind of acidic.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:05.780]   He actually likes it.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:07.380]   He thinks he thinks it could be a product.
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:08.820]   I'm putting a little more in.
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:12.020]   The coffee and the man Greer.
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:13.380]   We may have come up with something.
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:14.900]   I think we've come up with something.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:15.780]   Coffee, man.
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:17.060]   You should try this in the vinegar.
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:19.380]   I don't think so.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:21.700]   Good gah.
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:24.020]   It gives it a body and a warmth
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:25.540]   that sangreia traditionally lacks.
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.060]   Brother.
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:27.940]   I'm not kidding.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:28.660]   Yeah, let me see.
[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:29.700]   Go ahead, try it.
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:31.140]   New Chromebook is here.
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:34.100]   I got an email from Tony Wang saying,
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:34.740]   "Can we buy it?
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:35.940]   Should we buy this chat?"
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:36.980]   The new Chromebook book.
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:37.540]   Traditionally--
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:38.260]   It's great, isn't it?
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:39.140]   Well, it's not great.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:41.460]   It's good.
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:43.540]   Traditionally, actually,
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:45.540]   Samsung has shipped this one for review.
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:46.100]   So we may--
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:46.820]   We'll get one.
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:47.460]   We may get one.
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:48.020]   We'll get one.
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:49.460]   I've reviewed the last two.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:53.780]   $249 for what is effectively a laptop computer,
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:57.300]   except really, basically, everything is in Chrome.
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:58.180]   Right.
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.220]   It's a browser.
[01:41:59.220 --> 01:41:59.620]   So--
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:00.260]   It's a browser.
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:02.180]   It only takes seven seconds to boot.
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:04.500]   You're going to be straight into Chrome.
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.980]   And anything that you do in your browser,
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:08.100]   you can do with this Chromebook.
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:09.300]   Two and a half pounds,
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:10.420]   0.8 inches thick,
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:13.300]   six hours of battery life in typical use.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.540]   You get, now, most of the storage is cloud.
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:16.980]   And I think that's one of the things that scares people.
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.060]   100 gigabytes of free storage on Google Drive.
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:20.100]   You can--
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:22.580]   It says you could play back 1080p video on it.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:25.380]   Yeah, the last Chromebook was--
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:26.100]   Awesome.
[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:29.060]   It was able to watch HD YouTube videos.
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:29.780]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:30.900]   Which the first one wasn't.
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.020]   It wasn't powerful enough.
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:34.820]   It is--
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:35.940]   And this is an arm processor, too.
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:36.500]   I'm sure it--
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:38.100]   Yeah, it's arm-processed.
[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:40.340]   I've wondered all along, what is the market for this?
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:43.060]   Maybe this is the education market as well, yes?
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.620]   [SINGING]
[01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:50.740]   Maybe this is the market.
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:52.820]   Little, tiny children.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:54.340]   This is the ad.
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:56.980]   So the ad says, "For keeping peace,
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:58.580]   for pace of mind, for play time."
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:02.900]   The idea is that you can share this with everybody.
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:03.460]   It's cheap.
[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:04.100]   You don't care.
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:06.500]   It's good for sleepovers, for homework.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:09.860]   So it's their position.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.780]   This is a home computer, a family computer.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:12.500]   Right.
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:12.740]   Right.
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:13.780]   It's funny, though, because--
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:15.620]   It's the second computer for first-timers.
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:19.780]   It seems like they're positioning this as the throwaway computer.
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:20.660]   This is the spokesperson--
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:22.820]   You know, and that doesn't seem like the best
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:25.380]   marketing campaign for a--
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:27.780]   First computer you'll want to throw away.
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:28.260]   Right.
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:28.500]   Oh.
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:33.140]   It's the one that you have around that you don't really use that often.
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:35.700]   But you can give to the baby.
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:38.420]   This is the baby's computer.
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:40.740]   It has a camera.
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.740]   Who produced this ad?
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:43.140]   Google.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.100]   Yeah, so--
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:44.980]   Crazy.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:46.900]   The cool thing is it does have a camera,
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:48.900]   so Google+ Hangouts work really well.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:49.460]   Hangouts?
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:49.940]   Skype?
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:50.420]   No.
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:51.540]   Because there's no Skype.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:51.860]   Right.
[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:53.460]   Hangouts are the only option.
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:59.380]   And they've been getting better and better keyboards.
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:00.820]   I haven't tried this one,
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:03.460]   but the keyboard on the last one was usable.
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.900]   So we want you to review this one
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.100]   since you've reviewed the previous two.
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:06.660]   Sounds good.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.620]   This is your--
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:08.820]   This is for Before You Buy,
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:10.420]   which is our product review show.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:13.620]   Google though, what happened to Google stock this week?
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:14.100]   It went down--
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:14.420]   What?
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:14.900]   How many--
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:15.940]   9%, 10%.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:16.340]   10%.
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:17.060]   Yeah, went down.
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:19.220]   They released their earnings prematurely,
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:21.380]   accidentally with placeholder text.
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:22.980]   And--
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:25.540]   So according to this pre-release,
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:29.700]   the third quarter of Ramen Vignu was 11.3 billion short of--
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:30.900]   the estimate--
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:33.780]   again, this is when the street says it's going to be 11.8,
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:36.260]   and it comes out 11.3, the street gets upset.
[01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:39.060]   Third quarter, profit, $9 a share,
[01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:42.260]   below the estimated profit of 10.65 a share.
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:43.300]   Stock went down 8%.
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.540]   Will it come back?
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:47.220]   It always comes back.
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:49.140]   Although there's a--
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:50.740]   I got a note here from Horowitz.
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:52.420]   Who--
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:53.380]   Do you still do the show with it?
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:54.500]   I'm a mastic Horowitz, yes.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:55.460]   Do you still do the show with it?
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:55.940]   Of course.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:56.420]   What's it called?
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:57.540]   DH Unplugged.
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:59.780]   It's for people-- investors.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:02.420]   Yeah, it's a good conversation between a dummy, like me,
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.460]   even though I write about finance for the last 25 years.
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:06.820]   But Andrew's very interesting.
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:08.260]   No, but he's a money manager.
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:09.300]   He's a different type of animal.
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:09.940]   And he's a smart guy.
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:12.340]   He's the guy who told me to get out and get into cash.
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:14.420]   Yeah, he told you a lot of stuff he didn't do.
[01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:15.940]   Well, yeah, I'm doing all right.
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.860]   Pay 700 bucks for Madonna tickets.
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:18.980]   Yeah, no, you're doing good.
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:20.740]   And I know how--
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:21.380]   Get all the cost--
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.180]   Incorrect.
[01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:22.340]   --in correct.
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:22.660]   That is.
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:24.100]   I always think of an athlete says,
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:25.620]   "Ah, yes, you're doing well."
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:27.380]   And I'm thinking, wow, that guy's smart.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:28.500]   Anyway, so--
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:31.620]   Did you see the ATM and his kitchen?
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:32.980]   No.
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:35.060]   Sounds like a game.
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:38.340]   No, the reason is, apparently, they stock it with $20,000
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:39.860]   every other month.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:41.460]   And he charges $450.
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:43.140]   The ATM fee is $4.50.
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:43.940]   That's $4.50.
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:45.380]   Because his friends are always asking for cash.
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:47.300]   This is why you could use the ATM in the kitchen.
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.100]   Oh, that's a good one.
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:50.420]   Only an MBA would do that.
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:52.820]   Anyway, he says there's going to be a horrible bunch of earnings
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:53.620]   coming out this week.
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:56.580]   It's going to be time to head for the exits.
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:58.580]   It's to Sean Stevenson.
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:01.620]   And he was outed because he posted it on Instagram.
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:06.420]   There he is to Sean with his ATM in the kitchen.
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:07.300]   That's very funny.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:08.900]   Very creative.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:11.380]   Yeah, there's an ATM.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:12.420]   There's an ATM.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:13.460]   I'm not giving you any cash.
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:15.860]   And he-- but the funny thing is he's charging his friends
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:17.460]   $4.50 to get the money.
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:19.460]   Well, if you have an account with Mechanics Bank,
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.740]   you'd get it refunded.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:21.300]   There you go.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:25.860]   That's from TMZ.
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:28.420]   Anyway, the point is the market's going to have some issues next week.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.540]   So the Google stock won't--
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:33.300]   We're going to see a lot of quarterly results this next week, right?
[01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:36.500]   Yeah, and apparently the ones that are coming out aren't pleasant.
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:37.940]   So why?
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.220]   What's going on?
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:42.820]   One of the problems Google's having is mobile advertising is not nearly as profitable.
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:45.540]   It's about 40% less profitable than traditional advertising.
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:47.860]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:50.580]   This is a cycle.
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:51.060]   It goes up.
[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:53.860]   It goes down turn and it's going to continue
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:55.140]   being that way till 2020.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:56.980]   And it's a transition because of mobile.
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:58.500]   Mobile is the issue.
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:46:59.780]   That's what's wrong with Facebook.
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.460]   It's what's wrong with Google.
[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:01.700]   Right.
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:08.900]   OK, back down to the depths of depression.
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:10.180]   Anybody have anything to say?
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:12.020]   What are you looking at?
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:15.460]   I'll just keep-- I can kill the dead air.
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:18.660]   And-- I think the rain is--
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:19.140]   I'm reading this--
[01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:21.940]   Dave's coffee syrup.
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:22.500]   Is that what you think is--
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.620]   I feel strangely innervated and energized.
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:27.060]   It says we prefer none of this.
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.420]   High fructose corn syrup.
[01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:28.980]   No.
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:29.620]   Corn syrup.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:29.940]   No.
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:30.900]   Artificial colors.
[01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:31.140]   No.
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:33.140]   It's good, isn't it, Steve?
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:34.340]   And it says--
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:36.500]   Why would coffee taste good in sangria?
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:36.900]   It says--
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.100]   It's like a whole breakfast.
[01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:41.780]   If you put some bacon in here, bacon, orange juice, and coffee.
[01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:43.140]   He just mixed it up.
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:43.620]   Oh, great.
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.980]   He has bacon, man, gria.
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:46.580]   He can make that.
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:47.620]   I bet you he can.
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:50.420]   Steve, is there a website people can go to?
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:51.620]   What's it?
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:52.260]   Yeah.
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:54.820]   The company I work for is actually--
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:55.380]   Patio.
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:57.540]   In CaliforniaShiners.com.
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:59.460]   CaliforniaShiners.com.
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:01.380]   Because if you drink enough of this,
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:03.860]   you'll have a shiner after a few days of--
[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:06.420]   I'd just search on mangria and find it.
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:08.100]   Well, because I'll get Adam's site.
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.020]   But that's our--
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.460]   The California Shiner--
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:13.300]   He's just a front man for these guys.
[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:15.460]   There's only one company in Napa, California
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:17.220]   with single source solutions.
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:19.060]   These guys are-- but these are--
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:20.660]   It's a single source solution for--
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:22.340]   manufacturers, OEMs.
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:25.220]   They make wine for people like Adam Corolla.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:26.580]   Or me.
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:27.620]   Corolla plugs it.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:29.540]   So what would be more profitable for me?
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:31.540]   Next thing you know, you get a check in the mail
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:33.060]   for $10,000 a week.
[01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:34.340]   I could go with me.
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:35.940]   See Madonna every week.
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:36.900]   You see what he says?
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:37.620]   He says it's true.
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:40.820]   $10,000 a week and Madonna is yours.
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:41.460]   You can own her.
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:44.420]   Oh, I pout that.
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:47.700]   Well, it's a nice thought.
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.060]   Or next is not.
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:49.780]   Not a nice thought.
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:50.420]   What am I thinking?
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:53.620]   Oh, I got a check to say.
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:56.900]   Are you sure you want to be on record with that statement?
[01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:59.940]   Well, let's take a break.
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:01.060]   I got to take a break.
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:02.020]   I know we just took a break.
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:03.540]   But we have a house--
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:04.100]   What do you call it?
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:04.660]   A house ad?
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:05.940]   Wait a minute.
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:08.260]   Are you telling me that you're going to run an ad
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:10.660]   that's technically a house ad?
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:12.260]   Yeah, but that's an ad for--
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:13.940]   Because you know what we find is an ad for people--
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.300]   You're on Twitter right now.
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:17.060]   Well, a lot of people listen to this show
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:19.060]   and don't realize we do a ham show.
[01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:19.940]   We do a review show.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:21.700]   Can we just start doing this?
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:22.660]   We've been doing it for about a year.
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:23.700]   You know, can I tell you something?
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:27.220]   It's increased audience for those other shows by 15%.
[01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:29.380]   Did you know that on this next Friday
[01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:31.780]   is the fifth anniversary of the No Agenda show?
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:32.980]   Congratulations.
[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:33.380]   Thank you.
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:34.260]   Are you going to have a party?
[01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:36.900]   Are you-- you're on twice a week now?
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:39.540]   Yeah, we started being on twice a week about five years ago.
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.260]   Let's see.
[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:45.060]   If you missed anything this week,
[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:46.340]   you missed a lot on Twitter.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:47.060]   We had a great week.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:47.860]   Let's take a look.
[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:50.580]   Previously on Twitter, Gizwiz.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:53.620]   You know what?
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:55.540]   They're not live.
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:57.300]   Yeah, this is pretty good for me.
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:02.100]   For $14.99, this is in fact better than a real animal.
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:05.380]   This week in law, it has not been my design at all
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:08.180]   to channel Joe Biden, you know, that then all today,
[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:10.420]   but this is a big, effin' deal.
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:10.980]   Know how.
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:12.660]   You know, I changed my mind though.
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:14.340]   I don't want to pay anything for David.
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:16.180]   Okay, how do you plan on doing that?
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:19.700]   Can I get a hotspot that I don't have to pay anything for?
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:20.980]   Um, maybe?
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:23.140]   Yes, the answer is yes, I is.
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:24.500]   Windows Weekly.
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:25.620]   Hi, Windows RT.
[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:28.900]   You want to surf this?
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.260]   Whoa, it sounds like Steven Sinosky.
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:31.380]   That's pretty strange.
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.700]   I recommend 64 gigabytes of storage.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.660]   I5 for the iPhone.
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:40.500]   Every week we cover five topics from the best apps to tips and tricks,
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.420]   and of course, the news you need to know.
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:46.020]   Twit, page E4.
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:49.860]   Is that it?
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:51.940]   It's Jim Cutler's idea.
[01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:53.780]   Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:54.740]   That's it.
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:56.260]   That's what you missed this week.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:56.820]   I didn't know.
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:58.020]   There was a lot more, but that was some.
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:50:59.460]   I liked the little parrot thing.
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.620]   So they're 1495.
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:02.500]   It's a little parrot key.
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:03.540]   Dr. Zad looks like a real thing.
[01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:04.580]   Can you bring me one of those?
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:06.260]   Because when you move your hand in front of it,
[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:07.380]   it wakes up and says hello.
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:09.380]   It's just like a furbie.
[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:10.420]   Interact with each other?
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:12.100]   No, I don't think so.
[01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:13.220]   Does it bite?
[01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:13.780]   Where's Chad?
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:15.940]   Oh, boy, that's better than the look of the computer.
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:16.580]   He's had it with you.
[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:17.140]   He said that's it.
[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:18.580]   You're already bossing him around.
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:21.380]   It's like a furbie.
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:21.940]   It's like a little--
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:23.060]   It's kind of like a furbie.
[01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:24.420]   It's like a cheap furbie.
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:25.940]   I can never have furbie too.
[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:26.740]   Here it comes.
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:27.460]   Okay, let's see that.
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:28.500]   Furbie's coming back.
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:29.860]   Furbie's like made a comeback,
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:30.900]   which is kind of sad.
[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:34.580]   Yeah, it works like that pen.
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:35.780]   Oh, there you go.
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:36.420]   He's not dead.
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:37.140]   He's just--
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:37.380]   Dead.
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:38.180]   He's sleeping.
[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:39.700]   He's finding for the fjords.
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.380]   I think the battery is he off?
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:41.940]   Oh, he's off.
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:44.020]   Somebody got tired of it.
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.340]   Oh, this is great.
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:47.540]   I mean, I'm telling you,
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:49.380]   it doesn't ever poop on your shoulder or anything.
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.300]   This is what you want.
[01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:52.340]   If you're getting lonely--
[01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:54.180]   Yeah, this is perfect for me.
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:56.820]   Hi, bird.
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:57.300]   Is there--
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:51:59.060]   Hi, bird.
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:51:59.860]   Hi, bird.
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:00.580]   Hi, bird.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:01.380]   Hi, bird.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:01.860]   Hi, bird.
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:05.060]   So Verizon is getting a little fire.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:08.020]   [Squeaking]
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:13.300]   Just hit it right on the microphone there.
[01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:15.060]   I've got a bunch of hat a lava that says--
[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:16.900]   It's the man's the man Gria talking.
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:19.940]   Verizon Wireless posts,
[01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:22.580]   we are able to view just about everything
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:23.780]   our customers do.
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:26.420]   App usage, browsing habits,
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:31.300]   even whether customers own pets or plastic parrots.
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:37.460]   Verizon Wireless is actually selling this information.
[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:38.260]   No, Verizon.
[01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:39.220]   About customers, yeah.
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:41.700]   Well, you're glad you got off Verizon.
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:42.340]   Listen to this.
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:43.940]   About the geographical locations,
[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:45.700]   app usage, web browsing activities,
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:46.900]   your web history.
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:47.700]   There's some concern.
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:50.260]   It actually violates federal wiretapping.
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:52.340]   No, well, they've all been--
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:53.620]   there's new laws that have been passed
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:56.980]   so these telecom companies can't be sued for anything.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:59.300]   They call it precision market insights.
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:00.900]   People are always saying,
[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:02.660]   oh, tracking cookies, things like this.
[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:03.540]   And I tell them,
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:05.220]   you know, the people you got to watch out for
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:06.420]   is your internet service provider.
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:07.860]   They don't need tracking cookies.
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:09.700]   They can see everywhere you go,
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.220]   one right after the other.
[01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:12.740]   And Verizon's taken advantage of the fact
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:14.260]   that when you're on a smartphone,
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:16.580]   you're there, you're a internet service provider.
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:19.460]   This is true of every of Comcast for Verizon AT&T.
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:20.420]   They can all do this.
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:22.820]   They call it precision market insights.
[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:23.780]   Verizon says,
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:26.260]   it's legal because we're not revealing
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:27.140]   anybody's identity.
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:28.260]   It's aggregate.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.020]   No, yeah, fine.
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:31.940]   Also, you can opt out at any time.
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:32.980]   Now, we mentioned this before,
[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:36.180]   and I encourage you to visit their opt-out site.
[01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:36.580]   What is it?
[01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:38.660]   Verizon.com/myprivacy.
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:40.580]   Yeah, it's--
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:45.700]   it's vzw.com/myprivacy.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.260]   Right.
[01:53:46.260 --> 01:53:48.340]   And you can opt out.
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:49.220]   You should opt out.
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:50.100]   There's my phone numbers.
[01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:51.460]   You might just want to cover that up.
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:53.540]   No, I don't care.
[01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:54.020]   Call me.
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:55.060]   I love hearing from you.
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:55.940]   In the middle of the night,
[01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:56.980]   anytime, just call.
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:59.380]   VZW, what is it?
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:02.180]   VZW.com/myprivacy.
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:06.180]   And they call it their CPNI,
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:10.580]   Customer Proprietary Network Information Settings.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:12.580]   And there's a little button that says,
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:16.980]   by the way, the default is okay to share my CPNI.
[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:19.060]   So you have to go there and click,
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:21.700]   don't share my CPNI.
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:25.700]   Now, I thought this was a Verizon.
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:26.980]   Oh, horrible, horrible.
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:28.660]   AT&T does it.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:31.220]   It's in fact even more difficult to turn off on AT&T.
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:31.940]   They all do it.
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:35.540]   Well, let me ask you something.
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:36.500]   Why do you care?
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:39.700]   Exactly my point, Jerry.
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:40.820]   Why do you care?
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:43.460]   I mean, from my point of view,
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:49.940]   if they would do more narrowly focused targeting advertising,
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:51.300]   I'd get less spam.
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:52.500]   Well, so this is--
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.100]   and I'm so glad to hear you, Jerry,
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.220]   because I've been--
[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:58.020]   I've been a lone voice in the wilderness on this one.
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:54:59.620]   I think what they should call is,
[01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:01.540]   instead of tracking cookies,
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:04.500]   is add customization cookies,
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.420]   because if that's how they're using it,
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:08.820]   the problem is we don't know
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:10.260]   that that's the only way they're using it.
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:11.140]   If they're just saying,
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:13.620]   we're going to see what websites you go to,
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:14.580]   what you like to do,
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:18.660]   and we'll give you ads that are more targeted at your interests,
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:19.700]   I think that's fine.
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:20.020]   Yeah, that's--
[01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:20.820]   The question is,
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.020]   is that all they're doing, right?
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:24.340]   What else would they do with it?
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:27.620]   I don't like it.
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:32.260]   Well, I understand you're uneasy in this, John,
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:33.620]   and in fact, I share it,
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:36.180]   but I try hard to think
[01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:39.060]   what terrible things people could do
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:43.220]   if they knew all the websites I visit.
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:45.140]   Well, it's not about you, Jerry.
[01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:46.660]   No, seriously.
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:47.860]   It's not about me either.
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:49.300]   It's about the fact that if they,
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:51.140]   all of a sudden, gets the goods on some--
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.660]   I'll give you some examples.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:53.540]   I'll give you the better one.
[01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:56.100]   You tell me if this is something you worry about.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:58.980]   What if you buy a lot of hummus?
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:06.100]   And the NSA has watches for hummus purchases on grocery markets.
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:07.460]   This is always a possibility.
[01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:12.020]   In fact, the Patriot Act tells the grocery store,
[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:14.180]   the movie store, the library,
[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:15.780]   they can't reveal to the customer
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.460]   they're even watching this material
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.060]   or giving it to the feds.
[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:21.620]   What if your insurance company buys information
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:23.860]   on how often you visit Dunkin' Donuts?
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:26.100]   Yeah, which is what goes on.
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:28.660]   This is why I don't have a Safeway Club card, I might add.
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:31.140]   So those are a couple of examples.
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:32.180]   John, you can--
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:34.100]   Well, one of the real problems with privacy
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:35.460]   is got nothing to do with the individuals,
[01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:37.860]   because all we all know that we don't do anything wrong,
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:39.780]   is that if they get the goods--
[01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:40.500]   Imagine this.
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.420]   If they get the goods on some senator
[01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:45.380]   who is a good guy, and he's--
[01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:46.580]   Our frank inference.
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:48.500]   But let's say he's having an affair
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:49.540]   and they could figure it out,
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:52.260]   and then they get essentially going to blackmail the guy
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:54.180]   to make him vote a certain way,
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:56.020]   which is not in the public interest.
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:57.460]   And so the guy votes that way,
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:56:58.980]   and they shut up about it,
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:01.700]   and all of a sudden this guy's voting in some way,
[01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:03.140]   that's not in the public interest.
[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:04.820]   And you do that with one guy, two guys,
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.500]   three guys, you do it with everybody.
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:09.620]   I mean, this kind of thing is just basic corruption
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:12.900]   at the base level, literally,
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:14.580]   that cannot be tolerated.
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:16.660]   That's why you have to have protections,
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.180]   so you don't have the sort of thing.
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.780]   So it makes it so easy for them.
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:23.300]   Especially for risin', which has been going on a long time.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:24.340]   Yeah, but at least it--
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:25.620]   Why make it easier?
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:26.740]   That's the question on my mind.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:29.300]   I'm not convinced it's making it easier.
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:29.860]   Look, by--
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:30.820]   Well, I am.
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:35.140]   In the '60s, when I was running political campaigns,
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:39.540]   I got paranoid about one of the offices we had,
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:41.940]   and I had some old friends of mine
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:45.940]   from another life come in and sweep the place.
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:50.420]   And they've only found about five modern phones.
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:54.180]   They found old carbon mics that had been put in there,
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:57.380]   because this room had been given,
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:57:59.460]   traditionally, to political offices
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:02.500]   by the real estate company that owned it.
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:06.740]   And everybody in the world had bugged that place.
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:09.700]   And I knew that, and I knew all my staff knew that.
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:12.180]   So if I wanted to have a private conference,
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:16.020]   we'd go outside and flip a coin as to which direction to go in
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:17.860]   and find a restaurant for heaven.
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:18.900]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:21.620]   And that's the '60s.
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.220]   Yeah, well, that doesn't end up--
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:24.420]   Yeah, well, that surprises me,
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:26.020]   but it just seems to me that--
[01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:27.540]   Well, Verizon's a good example,
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:28.660]   because Verizon does, in fact,
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:30.740]   have a lot of business before the US Congress,
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:33.140]   and a lot of reason to influence businessmen,
[01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:35.140]   and now they're telling us they're collecting information
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:35.940]   about us.
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:38.020]   And they say, "It's okay, because we're not looking at your name."
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:40.100]   I'm with you.
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:41.380]   I'm with you on this one, John.
[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.260]   And I don't even listen to the--
[01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:43.620]   No, that's funny.
[01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:44.660]   You never listen to no agenda.
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:45.460]   You should listen to it.
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:46.980]   You know it's on twice a week now.
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:47.540]   What?
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:49.940]   See, that would help, because I missed the Sunday
[01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:51.060]   show, but I could listen on--
[01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:51.860]   What, is it Wednesday?
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:52.580]   Thursday.
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:53.060]   Thursday.
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:53.540]   Head nine.
[01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:54.820]   It's a better day, Pacific time.
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:55.220]   Is it--
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:58.100]   I tend to be in agreement with you on that,
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:00.180]   particularly on the Sonoments here,
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:01.700]   but I do have a question.
[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:06.820]   Are you not convinced that the remedy may not be worse
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:08.260]   than a disease?
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:09.140]   What's the remedy?
[01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:10.740]   Government regulation, my friend.
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:13.300]   No, the remedy should be just the current laws
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:14.820]   that are in place already.
[01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:15.780]   We don't need new laws.
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:18.660]   What we need is less Patriot Act-style laws,
[01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:20.980]   which give these guys just a blank check.
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:21.860]   Do whatever you want.
[01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:25.460]   Yeah, well, I was against those when they happened,
[01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:27.300]   but nobody paid much attention.
[01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:31.060]   Hey, here is the Windows tablet you've been looking for,
[01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:31.460]   Jerry.
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:34.580]   20 inches, 11 pounds.
[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:35.860]   Wow.
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:38.980]   It's Sony's new.
[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:39.540]   Sony.
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:41.140]   They're right on top of everything.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:42.260]   It's tablet PC.
[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:43.940]   11 pounds.
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:45.300]   That's a coffee table.
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.020]   11 pounds.
[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:46.900]   Comes with a forklift.
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:48.020]   Well, it's surface, right?
[01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:48.580]   Isn't it white?
[01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:49.620]   I mean, isn't that the idea?
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:52.740]   This is basically a big Microsoft surface
[01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:54.900]   and you lay it on your dining room table,
[01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:56.900]   your coffee table, and your kids play with it.
[01:59:56.900 --> 02:00:00.740]   It comes, I presume, with wheels.
[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:03.780]   And a handful.
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:04.740]   Comes with hernia.
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:06.340]   What is wrong with Sony?
[02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:07.460]   I mean, what the hell?
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:08.820]   I don't know.
[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:09.780]   Maybe there's a market.
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:11.620]   It's only $879.
[02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:12.260]   It's only $879.
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:13.700]   Isn't that right, Johnny?
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:16.260]   Yes, if the right guy ever got a hold of Sony,
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:20.420]   the right CEO, this thing would be an unbelievable company.
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.220]   You think even though it's in Japan?
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:25.860]   Well, I think that's part of the problem.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:26.500]   Yeah.
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:29.540]   20 inch 11 pound file tablet with Windows 8.
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:33.220]   I think that shows you how hard the OEMs are working,
[02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:36.580]   because Microsoft's kind of eaten the sweet spot with surface
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:39.940]   and the OEMs are saying, well, we've got to do something different for service.
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:41.060]   See, that thing is a phone.
[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:42.820]   And that was the idea behind surface.
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:44.260]   That was the whole idea.
[02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:44.500]   Right.
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:46.580]   It's working.
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:47.460]   I'm so bummed.
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:52.500]   When Apple announced the new iPad, when was that back in January,
[02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:56.100]   they showed a game called Infinity Blade Dungeons,
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:57.220]   which looked like a great game.
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:01.540]   And now the latest is, it's not going to be out till next year at the earliest.
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:03.060]   Coming out with Duke Nukem 10.
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:06.100]   Well, and then there's, what is it, haunts?
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:10.340]   There was a game, a Kickstarter project called haunts, I think it was,
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:12.500]   that has now decided that's it.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:12.980]   It's over.
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:14.180]   We're going to, we took the money.
[02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:16.900]   But we aren't going to make a game.
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:19.460]   And this, I've been waiting for this with Kickstarter.
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:22.020]   This is going to happen a couple more days at the end of it.
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:27.620]   Now the guy who's, the guy, Rick Dacon, who's the development team,
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:31.220]   says, I'll take the money out of my own pocket if you really want your money back.
[02:01:31.220 --> 02:01:31.700]   Really?
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:33.300]   You really want your money back?
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:35.220]   I'll pay you out of my own pocket.
[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:42.420]   They, 1200 backers, $29,000, that money immediately was spent to recoup some of the money
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:45.700]   they've already invested at that point, not enough to get it across the finish line,
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:48.420]   according to ours, Technica, Kyle Orland writing.
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:52.260]   He says, the two main programmers have moved on to other jobs.
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:55.140]   And pretty much it.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.820]   It's pretty much it.
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:02:00.660]   So yeah, I think we're going to see a lot of those Kickstarter.
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:02.260]   Yeah, well, it'll be, it'll be the end of it.
[02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:03.460]   I think it's got about a year left.
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:10.180]   Unless they better, they do a better job of vetting these.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:10.420]   Yeah.
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:17.860]   Um, White House, I didn't see this, but I'm going to go back to this Huawei thing.
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:22.180]   Uh, the White House is denying it.
[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:27.860]   They're saying, yeah, we got, we asked for the report, but, uh,
[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:28.500]   Denying what?
[02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:31.540]   There's no definitive proof that Huawei is spied on behalf of the China.
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:37.540]   Is this, is this the White House trying to, uh, deny ability so they can preserve their
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:38.740]   relationship with China?
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:39.300]   Yeah, obviously.
[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:44.500]   The White House has not conducted any classified inquiry that resulted in clearing any telecom.
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:47.140]   No, no, the CIA and the NSA did it.
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:51.940]   They could not determine whether the security vulnerabilities found were intentionally placed
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:52.500]   there.
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:55.620]   Could have been the next found security vulnerabilities already.
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:56.260]   And the accident.
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:58.580]   Well, we don't know if it was on purpose.
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:01.140]   Wow.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:04.660]   That's probably a good interpretation, John.
[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:05.300]   Yeah.
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:06.660]   It might have just been an accident.
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:09.060]   Yeah, it happens all the time.
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:15.300]   Speaking of accidents, DMCA takedown from Pearson, my old publisher.
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:16.500]   Everybody's publisher.
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:16.740]   Yeah.
[02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:17.780]   Pearson bought everybody.
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:18.260]   They bought everybody.
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:19.300]   They ruined the business.
[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:22.900]   There was a good thriving computer book business.
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:25.060]   And then Pearson just bought every publisher up.
[02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:30.580]   They bought up Macmillan and, and, uh, peach, pet, and everybody, literally.
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:35.540]   They took down server beach, which hosts something called edu blogs,
[02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:43.540]   because they found one of their books posted on an edu blog website by a teacher,
[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:45.780]   which I think is fair use, but anyway, I don't know.
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:50.820]   A hunt 1.5 million teacher and student blogs taken offline.
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:53.700]   Well, actually, I think it was an assessment.
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:58.660]   It was some kind of an assessment tool that, uh, that's been around for years and years
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:01.300]   and had been on that blog for years and years.
[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:01.460]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:03.060]   Bex and hopelessness scale.
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:05.700]   Bex hopelessness scale.
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:07.380]   Mm hmm.
[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:07.860]   Wow.
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:09.700]   And this is what's wrong with the MCA takedowns.
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:12.260]   It took down server beach, which took down edu blogs,
[02:04:12.260 --> 02:04:14.740]   which took down 1.5 million teacher and student blogs.
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:17.620]   It's a 38 year old questionnaire.
[02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:21.780]   And the post was here in two since 2007.
[02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:34.340]   Well, the DMCA needs rewriting, but it's not clear what, what, what, what the new law to be.
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:43.220]   I, when I was president of science fiction, writers of America got involved in the 75 copyright,
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:52.580]   law revisions, but, um, we didn't have much to do with, with DMCA, which just turned out to be a
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:53.380]   disaster.
[02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:58.020]   Let me do one more add that we're going to wrap it up and I'm going to ask you the question that
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:01.220]   was asked by Candy Crowley of the two presidential candidates.
[02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:05.540]   Why can't iPhones and iPads be manufactured in the US?
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:07.060]   Neither one of them decided to answer it.
[02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:08.100]   No, they both be around the board.
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:09.220]   They answered other questions.
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:10.260]   It's as usual.
[02:05:10.260 --> 02:05:11.220]   Wow.
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:11.700]   Why answer?
[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:12.500]   They didn't know.
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:12.820]   Yeah.
[02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:13.700]   Because there's no answer.
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:17.380]   The answer is they can't, but, but anyway, we'll talk about that in a second.
[02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:19.540]   First a word from audible.com.
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:23.860]   A chance for you to get to, no, I'm sorry, three books free.

[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:37.460]   99% of the books are a single credit.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:40.420]   So you really could get two great books.
[02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:41.780]   And then I'm going to tell you how to get a third.
[02:05:41.780 --> 02:05:42.580]   Oh, this is good.
[02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:48.420]   The, in the pleasure group of love, death, and Duran Duran.
[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:53.940]   John Taylor, founder of Duran Duran, finally, finally tells his story.
[02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:57.220]   I've been waiting.
[02:05:57.220 --> 02:05:59.780]   I have been waiting for this book.
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:04.740]   And by the way, you can get the Kindle edition, the print version for the Kindle.
[02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:08.340]   And then get a discount on the Audible book.

[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:11.940]   You can read it on the Kindle.
[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:14.580]   And then it'll jump to that part when you get in the car and listen to the audiobook.
[02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:17.780]   And go back and forth, never rereading a single word.
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:18.420]   Isn't that cool?
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:20.340]   Listen and read at the same time.
[02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:21.380]   How does it even work?
[02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:22.340]   How does it know?
[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:22.900]   I don't know.
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:24.980]   It's, it's a miracle.
[02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:26.020]   Smart technology.
[02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:30.420]   So audible.com/twit2, what else would you like?
[02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:33.780]   Oh, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is on here.
[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:35.540]   Do you like that book?
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:37.380]   John C. Devorak?
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:38.340]   Yeah, it's a very good book.
[02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:39.860]   I think I recommend everyone read it.
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:46.180]   John Perkins talks about how governments influence, how the US influences other governments
[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:47.060]   to do their bidding.
[02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:51.940]   And everybody who's read this book says, yeah, that's basically how it works.
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:52.740]   Yeah.
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:54.340]   I mean, it's not like even a secret.
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:54.580]   No.
[02:06:54.580 --> 02:06:56.820]   Kind of an eye opener.
[02:06:57.700 --> 02:06:59.780]   Confessions of an, that's another great book you could get.
[02:06:59.780 --> 02:07:02.180]   Bailout Nation.
[02:07:02.180 --> 02:07:07.860]   I'm this, you know, politics, history, Steve Jobs biography.
[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:09.780]   There's so many great boa or a hundred thousand titles.
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:13.300]   The hardest thing to do is to pick the book you want, but you're going to get two if you go
[02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:15.140]   to audible.com/twit2.
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:18.500]   Now let me show you the other free book, which anybody can get.
[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:21.220]   You don't even have to become an audible subscriber to do it.
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:23.540]   It's a, it's a Brandon Sanderson's Legion.
[02:07:23.540 --> 02:07:24.100]   I'm in listening to it.
[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:25.300]   It's a great book.
[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:30.500]   If you go to audible.com/sanderson, you get a free, it's a novella.
[02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:32.260]   It's not, it's two hours in some minutes.
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:34.100]   It's a great book though, highly recommended.
[02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:38.660]   And, and it's a great way to, for somebody who says, I don't, you know, I don't want to sign up.
[02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:39.540]   I don't want to do it.
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:40.740]   Look, just get the book and listen.
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:45.460]   Audible knows once you start listening to audio books from Audible, they're great readers,
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:47.140]   they're great variety of choices.
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:52.660]   The ease of playing them on your iPhone, your iPad, Android, Windows, phone, it all works.
[02:07:52.660 --> 02:08:01.460]   Audible.com/sanderson for that free book, Legion, and then audible.com/twit2 for your platinum account.
[02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:05.060]   We thank Audible for their support for many years.
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:06.260]   So, what is the answer?
[02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:08.420]   I know, I think that's a tough question.
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:12.340]   Why can't iPhones and iPads be manufactured in the US?
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:20.980]   The, the story you've got goes into the idea of, you know, these, that China has basically built
[02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:28.980]   its entire economy around these low cost assembly jobs and that a lot of the items that are made,
[02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:35.060]   that the iPhone is comprised of, like processors and the Gorilla Glass are actually are made in the US.
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:38.660]   There was another story, and I can't remember where I, where I saw this,
[02:08:38.660 --> 02:08:43.300]   but they talked about the idea of one of the reasons that Apple and other companies use
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:51.220]   Foxconn is that there have so many people in one place building these things and they're very
[02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:57.300]   agile. They can switch things quickly because of the large numbers. I think at the main Foxconn
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:04.980]   plant, there's like a million people working and that, and that there are only 83 cities in the
[02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:12.340]   US where there's more than 230,000 people in one, and that's just one city. So, the structure of the
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:19.380]   Chinese economy and the way people live there is built for this. And, you know, Obama said at the
[02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:24.180]   end of his thing, he said that, you know, a lot of low wage jobs aren't coming back. We want,
[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:29.380]   we need research and, and more technical jobs here. And that's probably the right answer. He
[02:09:29.380 --> 02:09:34.660]   didn't go into more as much detail as this is, but, you know, essentially you don't want those jobs
[02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:39.140]   back here because they're very low. It did bring up in this article, which is from All Things D,
[02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:45.380]   a really interesting paper done by professors at UC, University of California, and Syracuse
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:50.980]   University, in which they point out that Chinese workers add about $10 of value to the iPhone,
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:57.780]   essentially the assembly alone. American workers add $162 worth of value, things like that gorilla
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:04.180]   grant glass and so forth, because, and this is kind of underscores we were talking about earlier,
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:10.180]   Jerry, high tech advanced manufacturing jobs for highly skilled workers. That's what we do best.
[02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:15.860]   And then the mass numbers required to just assemble those parts. That's what they do best,
[02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:22.100]   lower educated, less expensive workers. And so that may point to an answer to your question
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:26.820]   earlier, what should have, or my question earlier, what should Americans be looking for in the
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:34.660]   future? And it's those high tech advanced manufacturing, like the bread making and cupcake stores,
[02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:43.300]   and factories, hat places, cheese, the problem is that people are encouraged to think that if they
[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:50.980]   get some kind of education, they should get very high wages for what they do. And it's no longer
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:58.020]   very true. I tell my employees that every day, the university, the public school system,
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:04.500]   which we all pay for with taxes, only exists in order to pay its employees. It doesn't give
[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:10.180]   a damn what it teaches the people that go there. And in fact, you end up with people coming away
[02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:18.100]   with huge debts who don't really know how to do anything. I tell you did some real reforms in the
[02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:24.820]   public education system where you, where the taxpayers are actually getting some return on the
[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:29.700]   investment that they put into these schools, you're going to continue to export all of the
[02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:35.140]   medium jobs in below to somewhere else. Here's the problem I have with the whole
[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:42.020]   the whole concept of Obama's answer. And the, that sounds like a good idea. If we don't have all
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:49.140]   kinds of kind of in between manufacturing positions, literally kids in high school and college
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:53.540]   kids have nothing to do in the summertime. And it sounds trivial. But when I was a kid, I always
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:57.940]   had an industrial job in the summertime. I worked with McDonald's. I could still do that.
[02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:02.580]   Yes, that's unfortunately where things have gone to. Now that's where they're working in and out.
[02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:06.340]   McDonald's. Yeah, they're working at a hamburger place when you could have been working in a sheet
[02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:11.460]   metal shop. John, why is that unfortunate versus working in a sheet metal shop?
[02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:16.260]   No, working in the sheet metal shop is fortunate. Unfortunate. What's the difference? It's
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:19.860]   why? What's the difference? Well, for one thing, okay, let's start with this.
[02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:25.140]   How did you invest in economy? The pay was 10x. Okay, you got the lots of money. I mean,
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:30.180]   I worked at, I was a UAW of Union member and I worked at Ford, you know, talking about Ford.
[02:12:30.180 --> 02:12:35.140]   I also worked at the job in the summer. Yeah. And I also worked at Trailmobile and I was an
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:39.620]   inspector then I learned, you know, people skills other than, you know, was you like fries with that.
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:45.220]   And it was paid well. I mean, it wasn't as though you were, you know, working on minimum wage in a
[02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:49.940]   hamburger place and smelling like old grease at night every night. That was the downside.
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:54.740]   It's hard to get a date when you smell like hamburger grease. The point is, is that there's
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:58.900]   nothing and by the way, this limit and now they're getting old people to do those jobs that you're
[02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:02.820]   talking about. You just picked up as a kid. So you'd find these. In fact, I just saw it. In fact,
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:06.420]   they took a picture of it. I'll put it, I'll post it on the blog. I'm coming into pedal to
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:10.500]   whom I'm going. There's a corner there. There's some housing development around here and they're
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:15.540]   holding these arrows. You know, there's arrows that go, I always wondered who does. There was an
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:22.180]   old man, old man. The guy was like 90 and he was holding the arrow and the corner. That is really
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:27.220]   sad. If you, if you spend a whole lifetime giving and giving to this country and you end up being
[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:31.540]   an arrow holder, I am more along the lines. That is now, it's sound a little bit old-fashioned,
[02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:35.780]   but I'm more along the lines of the way it was before the tax system was brought into this country
[02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:42.340]   in the early 1900s, when most of the government taxes were paid for by tariffs of imported goods.
[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:47.220]   And I think that if we would tariff and I, all for tariffs, I don't see any reason why we can't
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:51.220]   have them. But if we would tariff some of this stuff that comes in from China that we can't afford
[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:55.780]   to make here to bring it up to the prices that it would cost us to make it and use that to pay
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:14:02.100]   for the government and not tax you, for example, as some people- I'm all for it. I go see Madonna
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:07.220]   more. It used to work fine. I'm buying a boat. It used to work fine. But yeah, we had Robert
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:12.420]   Behrens, John. They were all busted. We're Robert Behrens of today are working freely.
[02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:16.340]   You don't think we have Robert Behrens today? Actually, we do. We have, we'll always have Robert
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:20.900]   Behrens. Yes, but these guys are getting away with it. Yeah. Anyway, that's my rant for the day,
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:24.820]   ladies and gentlemen. See you again in the next No Agenda Show. Thank you, sir. Thank you,
[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:29.940]   John C. Devorek, channel Devorek, noagendishow.com. Anything else I should plug?
[02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:35.780]   Devorek.org/blog. There you go. Good place to go. And the Vinegar book is coming out shortly.
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:38.900]   Is it? I'm getting it. Next time I'm on the show, I'll probably have it ready to go.
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:43.140]   That's fantastic. And then you could make vinegar. I would sell vinegar. I'd rather sell vinegar
[02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:46.900]   than wine. Well, it keeps better. The vinegar I'm talking about is pretty-
[02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:53.780]   Takes a long time to make. Pricey. Right? Well, you talk about pricey, try getting an alcohol
[02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:58.660]   license. But- Well, no, I guess Steve has that. Steve's got it. Steve's got it. Steve's already
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:02.500]   set up for it. He's a one-stop shop. We don't even see the product. It's turnkey. I never even
[02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:07.700]   even go through my hands. Yeah, Steve just boom. Boom. Just ships it right out. The mangria.
[02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:15.860]   Buy the case. Buy the case. Jerry Pournell is still writing. Go to jerrypournell.com. He is the
[02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:20.580]   best. You are the best, Jerry. I'm just a fan of yours. We disagree politically. I don't care.
[02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:23.460]   I- Anything- Hey, by the way, were you excited about SpaceX?
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:30.820]   Yes. I think that private space is actually doing something. Now, what I was really excited about
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:37.300]   with SpaceX was the fact that they detected an anomaly and one of the engines turned it off and
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:43.540]   still made orbit. So they now have a stavable rocket, which was part of the design of the old
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:52.980]   SSX that I put together that became the DCX back in the 90s. So yeah, I'm very excited about SpaceX.
[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:57.300]   Yeah. It was a very interesting story. It looked like it went flawlessly and we found that later,
[02:15:57.300 --> 02:16:03.300]   one of the motors failed and it still went flawlessly. Well, it did go flawlessly. That's the whole
[02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:08.980]   point that it's savable and an engine out doesn't mean losing the rocket and the cargo.
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:12.980]   Pretty amazing. And they got the ice cream to the astronauts and that's what counts.
[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:16.980]   Yep. What do you think of the guy who jumped out of the weather balloon?
[02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:27.860]   Well, maniac. Wonderful. Yeah, maniac. I was marginally involved with Project Man High when
[02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:39.540]   Major Dave Simons went to 103,000 feet in a balloon back in the 50s. So I've kind of been
[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:44.420]   interested in that sort of thing for a long time, but obviously it hasn't been very relevant
[02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:50.740]   until recently. But yeah, that's really something that guys, you've got one nerve and I have.
[02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:57.220]   That's for sure. That's for sure. And Mr. Dwight Silverman, who does a great show called
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:17:02.420]   Technology Bites on the Pacifica Network out of Houston. What is it? WBAI? What are you on?
[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:08.020]   Oh, no. That's that's New York. I was on WBAI. That's the big one. Oh, it's KPFT and it's
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:14.580]   every Wednesday nights on on the KPFT. You can get it at kpft.org at eight o'clock central.
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:22.420]   And there you can read me at blog.cron.com/techblog. There it is right on his graphic. I'm below his name.
[02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:27.940]   You must read. Actually, his updates on links, I use that every week. I steal all your stories
[02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:33.140]   because if you want to follow tech news, yeah, it's great. He just go to the tech blog and read it.
[02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:36.660]   And you'll always be up to date on what's going on. Thank you for joining us. We do
[02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:40.500]   Twitter, 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern time if we don't have a fashion show, sometimes fashion shows,
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:47.620]   old things up. 2200 UTC on Sunday afternoon, Sunday evenings. I do love it when you watch live.
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:53.540]   We watch the chatroom. It's very handy. I hope you're not lying to me, Bill, in Michigan, when you
[02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:58.580]   say the Giants are leading five, nothing after two innings because that would be cruel and unusual
[02:17:58.580 --> 02:18:03.460]   punishment. That would be good. I do have a baseball game to get to. I do want to see how the
[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:08.500]   Giants are doing. Make sure you tune in. If you can't, we do on-demand versions after the fact.
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:16.260]   Always at Twit.tv. Thanks to Chad Johnson, our producer. Nice job, Chad. We needed your input.
[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:19.300]   Thank you. You were very handy to have around. Thank you.
[02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:24.020]   Is there anything else, Chad, that I should tell people because I'm a little drunk right now on
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:30.660]   Angria? In coffee syrup. Don't forget that. No, we covered it all. We don't really have any
[02:18:30.660 --> 02:18:37.700]   promise. The third. Other than Apple coverage, live Apple coverage of the event. Thank you. I
[02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:41.860]   knew there was something. There we go. That begins what? 9am or going to do TNT on Tuesday,
[02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:47.300]   9am Pacific, 12 noon Eastern, and the Apple event is at 10am. So right after TNT, we'll go to
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:51.780]   coverage of whatever the heck Apple's going to announce. We are also doing special live coverage
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:57.540]   of the Windows launch. And I think we're going to do the Google thing the next week on the 29th.
[02:18:57.540 --> 02:19:02.260]   Yeah, maybe we should get that all about Android crew. We'll make that work for a change.
[02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:07.380]   Thank you all for joining us. We'll see you next time. Another Twit is in the can.
[02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:14.980]   Do the twin. Do the twin. All right. Do the twin. Maybe. Do the twin. All right.
