[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   It's time for Twi, before we get started, of course, it's Memorial Day weekend in the
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.320]   United States, and I want to just thank the members of our Armed Forces, the men and women
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.160]   who give so much to protect us in the United States on this Memorial Day, and those especially
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.520]   who have given the greatest sacrifice.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.520]   Let's not forget them.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.480]   We've got a great Twitter head, Philip Elmer deWitt, Stacey Higginbotham, and my friend

[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.240]   You have behind you your Apple TV is displaying shots of San Francisco.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.720]   Yep.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.920]   I love that.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   Yeah, that's really pretty.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.920]   Welcome.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.680]   Your microphone is way off to your right.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   I don't know why.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.280]   Maybe you should bring that along.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.120]   That's your face.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.120]   Are you facing differently than you usually do?
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120]   No, I'm not.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   I'm good.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120]   It's good.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   I mean, it's just I like to hear you.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.120]   Also with this, actually it's I think it's first appearance with us since leaving Fortune
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.720]   magazine, Philip Elmer DeWitt.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.920]   Ed, I want to find out about the new effort.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.480]   You got a new camera.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480]   I could tell that.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.120]   Man, that looks good.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   It's the same camera.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   It's just in focus.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.920]   I don't know what happened.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   Minor detail.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   Minor detail.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.720]   Also with a Stacey Higgenbotham, who is also our newest co-host on this week in Google.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.720]   Hello, Stacey.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   Hello.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.640]   Stacey hosts an IOT podcast with Kevin Tofel.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.400]   And we call her Stacey IOT, which does not mean Stacey at.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.800]   I was going to say it's close to Stacey IOT.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   Don't do that.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.100]   Stacey IOT.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.720]   But also worked with, did you guys work together?
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.960]   I guess you did at Fortune.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   We did?
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.600]   I think I've edited some of his stories.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   That's right.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.000]   And we used to sit, we sat next to each other a couple of times at meetings.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Oh.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Oh, is it?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.800]   No, I was like, you were far away.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.120]   But yes, in meetings.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   In meetings.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.120]   Well, it's great to have two former fortuneers.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.640]   And I'm not going to draw any conclusion from that.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.840]   They hired up.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.080]   Could be that.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.440]   And then they whittled down.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   Could be that?
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.080]   Could be we don't know.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   We do.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.080]   We do know.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.880]   I've been listening to Dan Lyons' book Disrupted on his abrupt departure from Newsweek and
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.080]   his attempt to make a life for himself in marketing.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.240]   And it's really funny.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.240]   Oh my.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.320]   The excerpts were funny.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.440]   I wondered if it would hold.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.440]   It holds.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.440]   Yeah, it holds.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.080]   He's really a funny writer, actually.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.720]   I really like his stuff.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.160]   He once said he was never as funny as he was writing fake Steve Jobs.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.280]   He just never could do it again.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.640]   Well, that would be a tough thing to top.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.640]   I'm not sure I agree with him because, you know, remember, he also worked for two seasons
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.760]   of Silicon Valley, which was one of the funniest shows on TV.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.040]   What we don't know is which jokes he wrote.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.720]   So it could be he wrote the bad one.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.960]   But he was bad at Newsweek.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   That was...
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   Was he?
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.560]   He said, yeah, I didn't know he wasn't good.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.240]   Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.080]   What was bad about him?
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.440]   Well, you know, because I've watched Apple.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.840]   He was just wrong about Apple.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.560]   Oh, well, yeah.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.280]   That's not hard to do, frankly.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.680]   I've been wrong about Apple many, many, many, many, many, many, more times than I care to
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.680]   even think.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.520]   I was the guy who said Apple is going down because they're changing to the Intel chip.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.840]   Could I have been more wrong?
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.040]   If you could have played me for that, that seemed like a bad idea.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.320]   I remember also saying, almost exactly what was it, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, Apple
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.480]   going into retail.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   Are you nuts?
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.520]   Don't you see what gateway happened to gateway?
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.080]   You fell into that.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.160]   I guess I was wrong there too.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.920]   Now I'm saying Apple, I remember saying very well when they said, when the rumor was they
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920]   were going to get in the phone business.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.200]   It's the last business you want to get into.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.840]   It's like that cell phone business is a terrible business.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.280]   Do you make, you know, the Gruber, John Gruber's got his claim chowder list.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.080]   I hadn't seen your name in it.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.880]   Well, John's being kind probably.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.200]   The latest is, of course, why would Apple get in the car business?
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.440]   That's just the worst.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.440]   You're trying to compete against companies that have been in this business for 100 years.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.440]   Insane.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   Right.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.320]   Have you any idea how complicated a car is?
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   Exactly.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   Because that's what they say.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.120]   You know how complicated it is.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.920]   Do you think they're really going to do a full on car?
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.120]   I can't believe that they would do a full on car.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.760]   I feel like you got to understand how the car works before you can take it apart.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.360]   That may be what's happening.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   And then they just come up with a clap.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.560]   You think they're like a 12 year old kid taking apart cars?
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.960]   Like just to see what's inside.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.400]   You think that's what's going on in those secret bunkers in Sunnyvale?
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.880]   I'm going to put it out there.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.360]   I'm like, I just can't believe they would actually do a car, like a true Tesla style
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.200]   or car style car.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.720]   Maybe something about transportation when we get to self driving cars or, but just, I
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.560]   don't know, but I'm willing to be wrong.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.520]   Yeah, I think they are.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.760]   I think they're building a car.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.040]   It feels like they've put a lot of money into it, right?
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.040]   Yeah, they have.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.400]   I think they've pivoted the company and they used to make smartphones and in the future
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.520]   they'll be making cars.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.720]   So you agree with that blog post that says based on R&D numbers, it's from above Avalon.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.360]   This came out May 11th.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.800]   Neil Seibert said based on the R&D numbers and the huge growth in the R&D budget over
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.600]   the last few years, he said it was a pivot.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.040]   I mean, a pivot implies that your current strategies failed and you have to quickly
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.360]   turn to another one.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.560]   But in this sense, I think what he means is just as you said, Apple's looking at a
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.560]   new category.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:14.600]   And actually, Katie Huberty at Morgan Stanley lifted that chart, did a better job with
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   it.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.720]   And Morgan Stanley came out and said, "Yeah, they're doing it."
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:27.000]   So they basically did for the buy side investors what above Avalon did for ordinary mortals.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.920]   Well, I should change my, you should put my new blog address.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.920]   We'll put that in.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.320]   Or we didn't check it, lower third before, what is the new blog?
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.560]   Well, it's called Apple 3.0 and the address is ped30.com.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:49.240]   And Philip, I should point out, has a much better track record of Apple prognostication
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240]   than I do.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.960]   I also, as long as we're being complete, said the Apple Watch would be a flop.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.880]   And I love the Newton.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.880]   Right.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.160]   Well, you, I'm just more cautious than you are.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.360]   I don't, I don't.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.440]   I try not to say what's going to happen.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.600]   I always told what happens.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.920]   It's a dumb thing to predict tech.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.760]   It's, and it's dangerous to bet against Apple.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.160]   It doesn't feel like it's dangerous these days.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.840]   Well, it depends whether you're talking about short term bets in the options markets or
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:25.520]   whether you're talking about, you know, I mean, you know, everybody says Apple, the
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.880]   iPhone, well, you just said it, the iPhone, you know, business is dying.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   So they have to pivot to cars.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.560]   Well, ask all of Apple's competitors whether they think the iPhone business is dying.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.480]   And the stock market seems to be believers.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.600]   Apple tanked a little bit when Apple's, when the quarterly results came out and they showed
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.720]   that they weren't in fact growing the iPhone market.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.400]   But now what they're up about 10% over the last few days.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.200]   Yeah, that's, that's that.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   That's that people.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   No, it's Warren Buffett.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   Warren Buffett.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   Must be nice.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   Must be nice.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   Oh, yeah, that's Warren.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   It's not just him.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.800]   He's quick to point out it wasn't him at all.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.920]   He says, I only weigh in on buys more than a billion dollars.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.040]   It was just, it was one of his managers.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.440]   No, it was one of his managers who spent $950 million.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.800]   And I have to think the guy sitting there saying, well, stop, stop, stop.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   He spent a little bit more.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   We're going to have to call Warren.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.360]   Let's stop at nine 50.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:32.280]   But this, the last couple of weeks, the stock is, you know, it hit bottom and bounced finally.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.160]   And it's not Warren Buffett or even Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.160]   That's old news.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.000]   What it is is the value investors seen.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.160]   They do what Berkshire Hathaway does.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.800]   So the money's been moving.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.320]   And also Apple, which wasn't buying back shares for a while, is now buying back shares
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.320]   again.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.880]   And maybe more important to those investors, the fact that they probably can profit.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.600]   Well, they're selling back.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.080]   Berkshire Hathaway put in a billion dollars.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.880]   Apple just increased the amount it's going to spend on buybacks by $35 billion to give
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.240]   you a sense of the scale of things.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.400]   Well, and also to give you a sense.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.480]   And this is not a stock market show.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:14.400]   And I'd be the last person to listen to any stock tips from me or you.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.960]   We wouldn't be journalist if we knew anything about the stock market.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.640]   We'd be out there driving our gotties.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.040]   But I look at Apple's-- and I think that's what people are looking for if they're value
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.280]   investors is a stock price that is below what it should be.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.520]   And I look at Apple's price to earning.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.360]   They're $11.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.760]   $11.17, PDE.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.120]   That's before you take the cash out.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.880]   Ah, well--
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.720]   That's the cash.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   It's more like $8.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   And Amazon.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   What is Amazon's PDE?
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.640]   It's like $8 billion or something.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   It's a--
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.680]   It's usually-- you can't chart it because it's a fin of you.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.640]   But it's come down.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.840]   And now it's like a $200 and something now.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.920]   Unbelievable.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.360]   So at the same time, I'd feel better buying Amazon stock maybe now than Apple.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.880]   I don't know.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.160]   What do you think?
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.720]   Well, it's all based on what people think it's going to grow.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.040]   And Amazon and Google are growing like gangbusters.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.400]   And Apple just had its first down quarter in 13 years.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.320]   So that explains--
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.840]   But for our purposes-- and we're not talking about what you should buy or anything like
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.520]   that, stock-wise.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.920]   We're talking about how companies are doing, what their future is,
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.160]   and whether they're going to change their business because they have to.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:43.280]   Amazon's PDE right now is $293 compared to Apple's $11.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.920]   If you look at Apple Joe is just selling physical goods, which
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.520]   is how people tend to see them.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.720]   And you look at Amazon, which is in distribution.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.000]   It is in e-commerce.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.160]   It is now banking on AI with the Echo.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.960]   That's a lot--
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.800]   And the cloud.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.600]   I mean, they--
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.100]   Oh, sorry.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.720]   The $10 billion cloud business, right?
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.400]   It's a big business for them, even though they suck at it.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.120]   I don't think they suck at it.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.840]   Really, Christina?
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.440]   You think they've done a good job with their services?
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.000]   I do.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.920]   I think AWS has been a huge success.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.160]   I mean--
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.320]   Oh, you're talking about Amazon?
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.520]   I was talking about Apple.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.020]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.840]   Stay with the thread.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.560]   Hey, can you boost Christina's volume up?
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.120]   She's not as loud as the rest of us.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.280]   You must have had some sense, though, Philip, what we were going to talk about,
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.000]   because I look at the blog post you wrote, I presume earlier, tonight on Twitter,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.480]   Apple is doomed.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.640]   Well, I just knew that it was going to come up.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.960]   You knew this would come up.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:52.160]   And I forgot the little Flash S or whatever one says when one's being ironic.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.360]   Yeah, that's not going to work.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.960]   People don't understand irony in the internet.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.840]   I would be the last person to say any company with $200 billion in cash in the bank is doomed.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.880]   They're, well, you have to subtract the $80 billion that they borrowed to give back to
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.680]   shareholders.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.200]   It's about, you know, it's 240 and then you minus 80.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.400]   So it's like a 160 billion.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   Only a hundred and 60 billion.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.200]   It's like bigger than the GDP of how many countries?
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.600]   I loved, I mean, as long as we're talking Apple, I loved this Bolt's blog.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.880]   I've actually bookmarked this because I thought it was so great.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.880]   This is on medium.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.800]   Ben Einstein, product designer, lover of hardware, founder and poll nerd, Bolt VC.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.360]   It's a venture capitalist.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.080]   No, you can't manufacture that like Apple does too many startups.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.520]   He says, look at Apple's manufacturing and say, Oh, I want to do it like that.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.080]   I know, I don't, I want laser drilled holes.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.800]   I don't want to see any mold marks on my plastics.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.040]   I want to make a white plastic device.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.520]   And he says, you can't just give up on it.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.960]   Here are a few things Apple does that can cause problems for a startup.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   White plastic.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.560]   It's the hardest color to do.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.360]   Even Apple had a hard time with, I think it was, what was it?
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.600]   It was a white MacBook or something.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.760]   They had to put it off because they couldn't get the parts to match.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.960]   But you know what they do?
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.760]   And the white iPhone.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.760]   White iPhone, that's what it was.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.800]   You can, you'll see this if you look at your products that are white.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.000]   They do a shiny finish on one spot and where the joins are.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.400]   They do a matte finish.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.200]   And then they're like, Oh, we should do this because it's like water.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   It's smooth.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.520]   And then we went with this more granular gritty finish.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.920]   I'm like, yeah, huh?
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.920]   I said, don't do CNC.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.240]   Expect to do it at Apple scale.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.560]   What happened when Apple wanted to see the CNC machines, a million MacBook bodies, those
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.160]   aluminum bodies, they bought 10,000 CNC machines to do it.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   When they.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.080]   Newmarical controller or something like that.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.160]   Those automated.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160]   Whatever machines.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.160]   I don't even.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.160]   It's automated milling.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   That's the word.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   Yep.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.540]   How about when they wanted to laser drill holes and MacBook Pros for the sleep light, but
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:16.840]   only one company made a machine that could drill those 20 micrometer holes in aluminum.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.240]   So they bought the company.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.240]   Why not?
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.400]   It makes sense.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.720]   That's what you do when you have 140 billion in cash.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   Exactly.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.360]   You know the one that got me though, because I look at Apple boxes and I kind of, you know,
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   I'm the guy.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.040]   I'm the guy that does the recycling in the house and every Monday I have to break down
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   all the boxes and there are a ton of boxes that I have to break.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.920]   That's been an hour every Monday night breaking down boxes for the recycling.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.800]   And it's always the Apple boxes that you almost feel like I'm destroying a work of
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   art here.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   Really?
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.440]   Do you remember the original iPod box that was origami?
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.440]   No, I don't.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   I love that box.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.360]   So the original iPod box would kind of fold out in different ways and it had kind of like
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.400]   overlapping things.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.000]   It was a square and you had to fold it in a certain way.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.440]   It was like an origami piece.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.600]   It was so great.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.400]   And you know, I remember I kept that box for years that even after I got rid of that original
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.680]   iPod, just because the box was so fantastic.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.680]   Ben writes a full of boxes.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.360]   Yeah, you don't want to throw them out.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   Look at this.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   This is the Apple Watchbox.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.280]   The squares, it's like you use the CNC machine on the cardboard.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.840]   This is perfect.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.840]   Perfect squares.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.840]   And of course, it's a vacuum, right?
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.040]   So you can't just pull the lid off.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.440]   It's tight, so tight that it's a vacuum.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.800]   And then the foam inserts, he says, Ben writes, four colored doubled wall, matte boxes and
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.080]   HD foam inserts.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.320]   I know you're going to do this anyway, but be aware of these kinds of boxes will literally
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.720]   be the most expensive line item on your build of materials.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:56.040]   It's not unusual for them to cost upwards of $12 a unit at scale.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   Oh my God.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.640]   They spent something like $3 for those rows of Chinese workers to assemble them.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.840]   Right, but the box, you're assembling a box that costs more than you to per hour.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.760]   I mean, look at this.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.960]   And then I break them down because when I'm not going to keep this, but I feel terrible
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.120]   doing it.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.680]   I feel like I should feed this to a starving child beneath the opiate.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   That's bad.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.760]   I should not see that.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.000]   People actually make money, you're making those unboxing YouTubes.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.480]   And you know, get a hundred thousand hits.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.600]   We just, you saw me unbox my 43 inch monitor.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:40.960]   Oh, man, that was not boxed quite as tidally.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.120]   What are you going to see on your four screens?
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   I don't know.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:52.560]   I have no use for it, but I just, I thought it's, it's the.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.560]   Sometimes this tech stuff can really get you in trouble.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.440]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.280]   Just have a, I have a Jones.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.360]   All right.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.640]   I was, there's a lot of max stuff, but somebody in the chat room is pointing out quite rightly
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.320]   so that Apple is the Donald Trump of the tech journalist.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.440]   It's the one week, it's the third rail we can't stop touching.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.440]   That's what, what over.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.400]   That's total analogy.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   It's true though, isn't it?
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.720]   No, because Donald Trump is awful.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.480]   Well, I'm sure there are plenty of people who think another Apple story really Leo.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.200]   Oh, that's me.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   Uh huh.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   We can talk about something else.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   I'm happy to do that.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   I can join the same else.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.720]   I was going to say that I found something that my Tesla won't do, which if anyone in
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.680]   your chat room has any idea how to do this, it can't jump a car.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   You tried to jump a car in your Tesla?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.160]   No, I didn't.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.240]   I tried to jump a car, but we realized we couldn't.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.400]   And I know there's a 12-volt battery on it somewhere.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   Oh, jump started.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Oh, you're right.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400]   You can't.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   No.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.040]   So this was something we just learned today because my daughter left the car door open.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.000]   And so my husband's car, his battery died and we're like, oh, and then...
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.400]   Isn't that ironic?
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.600]   Oh, I happen to have a 25,000-watt battery pack right here.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.600]   Right.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.080]   But I can't start your car.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.080]   So yeah.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.400]   If anyone has suggestions, I am here for them.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.040]   Well, am I the only person who thought what she meant was jumping her car over other cars?
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   No, I thought that too.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   I thought that too.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.720]   But in fairness to me, I don't drive.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.440]   No, I drive and I still flutter.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.200]   I like that you have that visual of me.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.400]   I don't know what to do that.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   I'm like, yes.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.560]   You have a Tesla.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.560]   You have a Model S?
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.040]   I do have a Model S.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.200]   How do you like it?
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   I love it.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   It's not the fancy.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.800]   So I bought it used because I am not crazy enough.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.920]   Oh, my car is used.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.040]   So it doesn't have the autopilot features, which kind of makes me sad.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.040]   But I'm not the kind of...
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.480]   I'm thinking you're probably better off.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.000]   After seeing all the stories about, oh, I'm going to summon my car into another car.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.400]   I'm happy about that.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.080]   You know what I find interesting, of course, there's at least two people now who say that
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:16.520]   the autopilot has driven me into something, caused a wreck or whatever.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:21.800]   And in each case, Tesla's response is, well, we happen to have the data from everything
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.040]   you've done and you can see you made an error here.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   And it's like...
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.120]   You're basically going to end up arguing with a computer.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.800]   They know everywhere.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:39.920]   They apparently have every bit of everything I do as being logged in your Tesla.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:45.800]   Well, that's what happened to that New York Times reporter who tried to drive from Washington
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.360]   to New York or something and ran out of juice.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.760]   And Elon Musk actually personally said, wait a minute, I'm looking at your record.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   Why'd you go here?
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   Why'd you go there?
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.760]   Why didn't you go where you're supposed to go?
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.800]   Does that not bother people?
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:05.120]   It's something I think about actually whenever I review a connected device, I am super hyper
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:11.480]   conscious of taking notes, videoing things, because I know that if I get something wrong
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:17.800]   just by virtue of human error and it could be something really trivial, all the data on...
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:23.320]   I mean, in some ways it's accuracy, but in other ways it's really disconcerting.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   This is a different era.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:32.480]   I don't think there's any precedent for a consumer product phoning home and telling the company
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.000]   that made it what you're doing with it.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.960]   That's never been possible before.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.360]   Well, in Tesla doesn't always give the data.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.080]   There was a guy in Norway who wanted to use his Tesla data to fight a parking ticket or...
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.080]   I think it was a parking ticket.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.080]   And they won't tell him.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   And they wouldn't give it to him.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   They were like, nope.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   Oh, no, it's ours.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   And he had written a nasty review.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.080]   And then he had a guy in it.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.240]   Holy cow.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.440]   I mean, I think people thought it was bad that Apple could look at a test strip in your
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.960]   phone and tell you you got it wet.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.200]   This goes far beyond that.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.200]   Right.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.720]   Oh, I'm sorry, you seem to have dropped your phone in the toilet on 43rd in Broadway.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   You're about 4.30 AM.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.800]   You were in a men's room and you want to talk about that?
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.240]   Oh, no, it's not.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.240]   I never mind.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   I'll take it home.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   It's fine.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.600]   I don't want to talk about that.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.000]   And yet we live in this era where people are so concerned about privacy.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.520]   I guess if you're a Tesla owner, you just accept that that's the price you pay to own
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520]   a Tesla.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.840]   Speaking of the price you pay.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.880]   Once you get a Tesla to come start your car for you?
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880]   No, not that car.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   That's the problem.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   It was the other car.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.880]   The car next to the Tesla.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.880]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.280]   Just proximity to a Tesla does not guarantee a job.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.280]   That's not a service, Dan.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.200]   Tesla's going to come and start the old car.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:58.120]   You know, I had to get a hybrid, not a Prius, but made by Toyota.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.360]   I forget the name.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.240]   I had to get a hybrid because someone had left the light on for a week in an airport parking
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.400]   garage.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.800]   And two things are weird.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:13.000]   One, this car has a huge battery in it, but it can't be used to start the car.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Exactly.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.480]   That's what she's saying.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.920]   Well, no, but to start its own car, it can't start.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.120]   They can't use the battery and the hybrid to start the starter?
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.120]   No, because the starter runs on a separate battery.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.200]   And when that one goes dead, they don't-- they could, but they haven't connected the two
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   batteries.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:39.000]   The second thing is when the guy came to open it up, neither of us had a manual.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.880]   And it was really quite tricky finding where the plus and minus were.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.280]   They're not big red buttons with junk all over them.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.120]   They're under little things you have to flip up.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   And then they don't look like the normal things.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.120]   They look like USB ports, sort of.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.920]   So it was a whole new world.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.960]   You wrote an article on pivoting from smartphones to smart cars, in which apparently a car is
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.360]   jumping another car.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.360]   So--
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:12.200]   No, that was VW saying, we're going to bury Apple.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   Oh, more.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   And it was also--
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:20.880]   Also, Horace Deus saying that when Apple gets into it, they're not going to make 50,000
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   units like Tesla.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.240]   They're going to make 2 million units a year.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.760]   Isn't that what Elon Musk kind of said is?
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.120]   Look, we're going to jumpstart this industry.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.720]   But ultimately, we want it to be a mass market, whether it's us or somebody else.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   Well, yeah.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   But he needs it to be.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   Of course.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.680]   Now, will it be-- I think that's a much different question.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.600]   Because I don't know if they can get the scale that's necessary.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.240]   Well, they're getting pushed back.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.640]   And there's the Bolt, Chevy Bolt, which is a $30,000 electric vehicle with similar range
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.440]   to it, Tesla.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.720]   And Chevy seems to have some expertise in car manufacture.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.880]   Yeah, I drove one of those volts.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   What do you--
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   The new one?
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.880]   The Bolt?
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.880]   Not the Volt.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   No, no, I drove the previous one.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.520]   It didn't have a sufficient range.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520]   You can't live that.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520]   No, no, that's the new one.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.880]   See, that's the thing.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.040]   So the Volt has a little gas engine, a little generator.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.160]   It shouldn't call it an engine, a generator in it to charge the battery.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.320]   The Bolt is all electric.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.920]   And they claim they say they're going to have a couple hundred miles range, don't they?
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.080]   I thought it was like-- was it 165?
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.640]   OK, in the ballpark.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   Your mileage, it's very--
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.640]   Yeah, they--
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.480]   But that's significantly more than the current crop.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.360]   Yeah, but it's still not very-- because it all depends on how you drive.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.200]   So the mine's rated for what, 265?
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   Right.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   You don't--
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   Temperature.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   Temperature.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   What are you getting?
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   Also, age of the battery changes too.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   You lose mileage.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:51.120]   They're saying estimated more than 200 miles of range on the all electric Chevy Bolt EV.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   Oh, OK, number one.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.640]   I think about 200 when I drive.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.640]   Is that enough?
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.200]   It depends where you're going and what's at the other end.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.840]   It depends where it goes.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.040]   Yeah, I guess you would be nervous, right?
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:11.080]   Because it's not like you can call AAA and say, "Bring me a gallon of electricity."
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.080]   Right.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.120]   No, I mean, that's what-- I desperately want my mom to get a Tesla.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.480]   And that's always her fear.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.320]   They live in the suburbs of Atlanta.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.800]   And there are some stations in Atlanta proper, but they're like 40 miles away from their
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   house.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.880]   And so, you know, if they're driving a lot, I'm like, "Yeah, you know what?
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   This would probably not work for the distances you drive.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.760]   You would probably frequently be freaking out about, "Am I going to make it to get charged
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.760]   off?"
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   It's not for everybody.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.400]   Which I mean, which I think that's the biggest thing that even beyond the mass production
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.080]   that has to be solved, right, is making it so that there are charging stations that
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.040]   are accessible everywhere so that people can pop in and charge up.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.160]   And of course, that's what Elon Musk tried to solve with the superchargers.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.400]   They're free Phillips for Teslas, but they have to be near you.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.400]   Yeah, and they have to be near you.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.720]   And there's only the one between our, like, Austin and Houston that we stop at.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.960]   I think it's got six ports or six-- not ports, whatever you want to call it--
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   Little likes.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   Little parking spots.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   Plugs.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   That's it.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:19.040]   It's fine most of the time, but during, like, a busy travel weekend, it might get kind of
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   full.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.880]   And then the other thing is, once the Houston floods happened, it was flooded.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.640]   And I'm still not sure if it's ready, but before we take the Tesla down to Houston,
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.840]   we've got to check.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.240]   That's complicated, I guess.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.760]   It's an extra thing to think about.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.560]   You probably still want to have a gasoline-powered car for the time being.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.120]   And jumper cables.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.120]   And jumper cables and a nice taser.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.360]   Well, we're at the early stages of a transition.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.360]   Yes.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.600]   And five years from now, we'll look back and say, those problems were that hard to solve.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   You think?
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.480]   Because sometimes they are hard to solve.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.400]   And five years from now, we may look back and say, what were we thinking?
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.400]   Well, we're talking--
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.400]   We're not going to sigh.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.840]   In this case, we're talking about putting up charging stations roughly where you have
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.960]   gas stations now.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   So if the gas station--
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.920]   Well, it's more than that, because even at the supercharger, you have to sit there a
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   couple hours, right?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   Oh, no, no.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.720]   No, the supercharger is about 20 minutes at 80%.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   It's about 80%.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.120]   It's that last 20 that takes the other hour and a half.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.760]   It doesn't take a full-- I mean, we've gotten it almost all the way up in about 35 or 40.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.760]   Oh, that's not bad.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.080]   But that's a supercharger.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.200]   And in fact, Tesla says, don't use that too often, because it's kind of more for like--
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.160]   In fact, they told me I can't use the supercharger in Petaluma, because I live here.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.160]   Right.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.160]   It's not intended for you.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.880]   It's not like you have a free gas tank.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.120]   You should go over every day and fill up at it.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.200]   It's the model of the iPhone.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.920]   You got to plug it in every night.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   Sure.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   Well, yeah.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.800]   I got a special plug put in my garage.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.120]   No Tesla, but I got the plug.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   You're halfway there?
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   Halfway there.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.120]   Halfway there.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.120]   Not even.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:09.200]   Yeah, 1,000 of the way there.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   Let's talk about-- actually, let's take a break.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.040]   Then talk about Google Oracle.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.040]   We can also-- there's lots to talk about.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.000]   I have many a topic on our list here, but I also want to defer to you guys, because
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.360]   it's always fun.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.200]   We get people on the show, and it's Stacey's first or second time on the show.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   It's Phillips.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.760]   He's been several times, and Christine is a regular, but it's always fun to let you guys
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.320]   choose what you want to talk about.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.920]   So I'll open it up to you in a second.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.760]   Meanwhile, as long as we're talking about car tech, I want to talk about something you
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.280]   can do with your car, any car made since 1996.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.280]   And that's this.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   This is the automatic.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.280]   This is so cool.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:49.800]   So every car in the United States, and I think all over the world, made since 1996,
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.320]   has a port underneath the steering wheel you probably never noticed, called the Onboard
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.280]   Diagnostic Porter, OBD2.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.480]   And if you do notice it, you think, oh, yeah, that's when I take it into the shop.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.720]   They're going to plug in their computer.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.600]   Well, did you know you can plug in your own device?
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.360]   This is the automatic, plugs right into it.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   Easy to do.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.360]   There's no tools or anything.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.000]   It just snaps right in there.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.520]   And then you pair it to your phone with Bluetooth, iPhone or Android.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.560]   And suddenly, you know what's going on inside your car.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.480]   Everything from what is that light that just, morning light that just come on mean and where's
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.200]   the nearest gas station, a repair shop.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.480]   So I take it to how hot your engine is, how fast it's revving, how much gas you've used,
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.560]   how much that last trip cost you.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.520]   Because the automatic also knows what gasoline costs at the gas station you use last, so they
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.080]   know exactly how much it costs.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.160]   You can ask your, if you have an Amazon Echo, you can say to the Echo, hey, ask my automatic,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.880]   how much gas is in the tank?
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.040]   Oh, you have half a tank left.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.800]   Oh, thank you.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.760]   It'll work with not just your Echo, your Nest software like your mechanic.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.440]   It'll work with fresh books if you want to track mileage for business.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.440]   If this than that, I use it all the time with if this and that I have an if this and that
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:11.760]   script that when I pull up to the studio tweets, hey, Leo, just pulled up.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.960]   Let's get something going.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.120]   Be just as good for your teenagers.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:22.760]   If you wanted to keep an eye on them, there's even a 24/7 crash response feature, which
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.320]   helps you know that automatic is keeping your loved ones safe on the road at all times.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.360]   They have software for teenagers too that ties in with the automatic works with the Apple
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.640]   Watch and Pebble too.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.600]   Best of all, you might look at this and say, wow, how much a month?
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   Nothing.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.360]   There's no subscription fee.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.800]   No, no, nothing.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.120]   It's $99 and that's it.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.720]   And we're going to make it even more affordable because and by the way, they never sell your
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   data.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   Your data is yours.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.360]   If you go to automatic.com/twit, you're going to get 20% off when you use the offer code
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.040]   "twit" at checkout.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.000]   I love my automatic.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.520]   I just love knowing, you know, it's I kind of play a game with it.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.560]   See how if I can get a good score, you know, oh, you got 80% driving to work today.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.560]   Try to get 90% next time.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.520]   And that just means you get better mileage and you're a safer driver.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.840]   I love it.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.400]   Automatic.com/twit, 20% off when you use the offer code "twit" at checkout.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.920]   Philip Elmer to quit is here.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.920]   PED 3.0, not 2.0, 3.0.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.920]   PED 30.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.920]   Uh oh.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.920]   At business 2.0.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.920]   Oh, I can't.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:34.400]   I call that Apple 2.0 and then now I'm, you know, reading to it what you want.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.760]   Anyway, it's been fun.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:42.320]   I tell you, it's just so great to be on my own and not having to worry about fortune.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   Can you hear me?
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   Tell me about it.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.320]   Yeah, we're listening.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.720]   Well, we're just in awe of you, Philip.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:53.520]   Oh, well, I think we talked about this before, you know, when I started doing this stuff
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.240]   for fortune, it was me and a couple other people and they really weren't paying attention.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.640]   But after the spin off, after time Warner let time in go with a couple of...
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.800]   They started, they sat up and started paying attention.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.240]   Well, they realized they had to make money on it.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.440]   And so they got into the same business that every legacy media is in now and it's like,
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:19.080]   it feels like a death spiral where they have to get more and more ads.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:24.360]   They're basically trading, you know, print ad dollars for internet pennies and they're
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.800]   discovering that they have to pump a lot of ads, pass a lot of eyeballs to make what
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.960]   they used to make, you know, on dead trees.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.480]   And it's a tough business.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.040]   And what they did at fortune is they they staffed up.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.160]   They got some really good people, Stacy and a bunch of others from, from Gigo Home.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   But they also hired a bunch of kids and put them in a kind of a bullpen in something they
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:54.080]   called the SEO Speedwagon for search engine optimization.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:01.240]   And it's kind of like the Huffington Post-Dization of, of, of, Fortune Magazine where they, you
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.600]   know, they're going for the stuff that gets clicks.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   It's what everybody's doing now though.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.200]   It's really kind of in some ways that feels so, it feels like the death knell of journalism
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.400]   is going to be able to debate journalism.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.840]   Yeah, well, we'll get to Gawker.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.720]   Oh, let's talk about Gawker.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:24.800]   Well, we can get there in a second, but just, just me, my, my particular thing was that they
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.000]   were, these kids were chasing Apple stories, which I would too if I were them.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.160]   So I get up in the morning and think, okay, what I'm going to write about today.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.880]   And I, and all, one after another, the subjects that I was going to do, one of the guys had
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.000]   already claimed.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.160]   And so I was navigating this, every time I had to pick a topic, I had to navigate this
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   thing anyway.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   So it's so great.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.720]   It's not so bad to have competition among your writers, is it?
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.880]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.160]   Well, it was a little crowder.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.200]   It's good to have competition, but I'm competing already with a hundred other people who write
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.960]   about Apple every day.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.520]   And I didn't need to compete with, with my own team.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:08.440]   So they, you know, I think we talked about this.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.760]   They said, okay, you can't just write about Apple anymore.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.480]   You got to broaden your scope.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.600]   And for me, you know, it took a long time to build a reputation as someone who covers
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.600]   Apple.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.080]   And it was just, it was like walking away from my niche.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.160]   It didn't make sense.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.080]   So, so I did what I had been talking about doing for a long time, which is going off
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.000]   on my own, which Stacey has also done.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.520]   And a lot of other people, the Ben Thompson's of the world, the John Gruber is the, is the
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.520]   classic example of something.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.240]   Was Gruber, though, a journalist before?
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   I mean, no.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.240]   No, no.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   He's a developer.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   No.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.240]   No.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   No.

[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:03.240]   You chose this.
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:04.240]   I did.
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:16.240]   I mean, like, I live this so I can, but that's why when I see what Microsoft's doing and I mean, you see it, let's see, someone just wrote about Uber trying to, I mean, there's the Google engineer who wrote about how software companies and tech companies are trying to influence your decisions via design.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:18.240]   This is clearly one of those examples.
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:24.240]   Uber just is starting to do this with pushing people to Uber pool and I think it's Washington, D.C.
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:36.240]   And so it's a, it's a nudge, but I mean, we do this in policy all the time to get people to do what we want. The question is, do we want giant tech companies making this decision?
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:46.240]   It's different in policy. I mean, I thought these companies were, you know, I mean, we're, we're, what happened to the customers always write and, and customer centric business.
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:50.240]   And I mean, we're not the customer for, I mean, okay, in Windows, we are.
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:57.240]   But for a lot of these businesses, we're kind of this ancillary, we're either a source of data or a source of items.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:03.240]   I mean, we're the product to Google. In other words, we're not the business. We're just the product.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:08.240]   I think a lot of companies have that mentality even when they're selling your product. I'll be honest.
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:10.240]   Clearly Microsoft does.
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:14.240]   I understand, you know, and by the way, if I'm Microsoft, I understand this. They want to get everybody to Windows 10.
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:20.240]   Everybody uses Windows 10. It's easy to get application developers to support it. You probably could make the case.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:25.240]   It's more secure. Certainly they're not going to want to continue to support Windows 7 forever.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:32.240]   I mean, and I think too, I mean, they did say for a long time that you have a free upgrade, you know, from Windows 7, Windows 8 to Windows 10,
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:36.240]   another saying, okay, at the end of June or whatever, that's when they're cutting that off.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:43.240]   So if you do want to upgrade now, is the time to do it. I'm with you. They should make it really clear, you know, and you should have a really clear way to opt out and not do that.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:50.240]   But, I mean, a lot of people don't like change and there were a lot of changes, you know, to Windows 8 and less to Windows 10, but still changes.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.240]   And so, I mean, I think this is kind of a, they're in a weird situation. They need people to upgrade, but I'm with you.
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:03.240]   They could probably do this in a way that would be less shocking if you're, you know, by clicking the next button, let's put it this way.
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:08.240]   You shouldn't click an X button and then still have it installed anyway. That's not correct behavior.
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:15.240]   It's kind of like what we were talking about in Mac break weekly a couple weeks ago about, you know, iTunes and its terrible design for trying to delete a track,
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:19.240]   whether it's at least from your library or cloud or whatever. These things should be really clear.
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:25.240]   But I do understand why they're trying to get everyone on board to Windows 10.
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:37.240]   Here's my question. Has anyone come up with an app that you run on Windows 7 or, I guess, Windows 8, although I don't know anybody who would want Windows 8 and not Windows 10, that will, you know, disable this sort of update?
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:48.240]   I have it for you and it was created by our very own Steve Gibson, who hosts security now. He is a staunch Windows 7 user. He's called Windows 10 a flying turd.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:57.240]   He does not want to upgrade to it. Now the good? Yeah, never 10 is the name of his brother. The good news about this is he's doing it the right way.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:07.240]   Microsoft did publish instructions, mostly aimed at enterprise at an IT pro who wants to keep all of her machines at Windows 7 or Windows 8.1.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:13.240]   So Microsoft said, well, yeah, you can do it with G-policy edit or you can modify these registry keys.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:18.240]   But of course, no normal user has access to group policy edit or wants to modify their registry.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:23.240]   So Steve does it for you. This is a small assembly language program about 8EK.
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:35.240]   It also has a button to remove because one of the other things Microsoft does is download 3GB of Windows installer and then expand it to 8GB on your hard drive before it even does this.
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:42.240]   So you may, many of you sitting and watching this may already have 8GB of your hard drive used up by Windows 10 installer files.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:52.240]   So he has a button to remove those as well. And as long as Microsoft doesn't change their policy, which I think they won't because it would really hurt their reputation.
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:58:00.240]   This will always work. And you can delete it. Once you do it, you change the registry and it's done and you can delete the program.
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:05.240]   So never 10, if you Google it, it comes right up. It's very popular.
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:11.240]   So there is a way to stop it, but probably known mostly to people who watched it.
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:14.240]   Another good reason to watch our shows.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:23.240]   So, you know, okay, I think I did you a disservice because I instead of just showing this dialogue and saying, isn't this terrible?
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:27.240]   I kind of justified it and I think I successfully justified it.
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:33.240]   But I don't think the average user is going to look at that and say, oh, no, no, I don't want that.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:38.240]   I think the average user is going to say, well, I'm going to click that X because I don't want that to happen and it doesn't fix anything.
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:46.240]   There's only one way to stop it and that's to click here and that's a smaller typeface than the other stuff.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:52.240]   It is. They're totally nudging you to like letting it go and they're kind of lying to you with the click.
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.240]   Yeah, it's deceptive, but you know, you have a good point, Stacey. It's where we're headed.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:59:01.240]   I'm not saying that I like this. I'm just saying it's going to happen.
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:12.240]   Red, by the way, Microsoft, according to the register says, yeah, no, that's exactly Leo's interpretation is right. They didn't say my name, but that's exactly what we intended.
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:17.240]   And we're not going to change it. And we don't even think it's deceptive.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:22.240]   I would argue in the last point, but basically that's a screw you guys.
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:31.240]   Yeah, they emailed the register to say, hey, that's how the UI of our get this.
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:43.240]   The UI of our quote, your upgraded scheduled and quote notification is nothing new, including the ability to just X out of the notification with no further action needed to schedule your upgrade.
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:48.240]   Yeah, it's been part of the notification UI for months.
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:52.240]   And based on customer feedback.
[01:59:52.240 --> 02:00:00.240]   We confirm the time of your scheduled upgrade and provide you an opportunity for canceling or rescheduling. That's, that's what customer said.
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:02.240]   And that's the way it's going to be.
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:07.240]   So there you go. I don't, you know, I don't use.
[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:11.240]   I'm such a sheep that I always upgrade when Apple, you're different.
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:20.240]   Apple people see this way. People say, well, Apple does the same thing. Apple doesn't do the same thing, but they don't have to because everybody runs max. What's the update?
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:23.240]   Yeah, they're through. What?
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:28.240]   Well, okay, I update eventually, but I always wait to see what because because everything breaks on an update.
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.240]   You wait like three weeks.
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.240]   I even beta test them now, though. I'm not that one.
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:35.240]   You're just, you're just, yeah.
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:37.240]   Yeah, I don't think I have to.
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:42.240]   I was nine point three point.
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:46.240]   What was it? The most recent update bricked some proportion of.
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:01:01.240]   I was. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I run iOS beta on one device just for testing, but I mean, for one of my max, I run, I always run like the beta version of a OS 10. And that I actually haven't had any problems with and fairness.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:06.240]   I mean, OS 10 is pretty done at this point. It's pretty stable.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:11.240]   So it's not like they're making huge fundamental changes to it the way that Windows is.
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:18.240]   So there aren't as many things to potentially break when you get an update from 10.11 to 10.12 or whatever.
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:38.240]   I found a Forbes writer who every time there's a new iteration of iOS, he writes a headline about there's a nasty surprise. And there were like a dozen of these headlines. He did it every time.
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:53.240]   I know that writer is and he's widely reviled in Apple circles. They're on to him. We're going to take a break when we come back our last story. An argument.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:02:07.240]   Why VR will never succeed. But first, if you missed anything this week, oh, you missed a bunch of stuff. We got a little mini movie to show you some of the highlights. Take a look.
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:12.240]   Previously on Twitter.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:14.240]   All that I can do.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:29.240]   Twitter Live specials. Are you a maker? An inventor? A tinkerer? An engineer or an artist? If so, I've got just the place for you. I'm Father Robert Bellisser, the digital Jesuit welcoming you to Maker Faire 2016, Santa Mateo.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:30.240]   Windows Weekly.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:38.240]   These get Windows 10 advertisements. This weird stuff that Microsoft's doing to try to literally fool people into upgrading to Windows 10 by mistake is the wrong way to treat customers.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:53.240]   We also have to acknowledge there's plenty of people who have good for perfectly good reasons for not upgrading. They should not be tricked or forced into it. They should bring back Clippy. The Clippy could say, Hey, it looks like you try to upgrade to Windows 10. Do you want me to get that thing going for you? And he can be like, No. And then he'll say, Okay, let's install Windows 10.
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:03:13.240]   I'm not going to use today. So it's time for double dose of, Hey, we're investing in ride sharing companies too. Toyota struck a pretty important strategic partnership in Uber, allowing drivers to lease Toyota vehicles and not to be left out Volkswagen announced that it has invested $300 million into get.
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:25.240]   This feels to me like the weeks leading up to the senior prom where everyone's like, you know, you're fine. You'll do like, let's pair up like, you'll do better than nobody. I get to it. We love you.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.240]   We do. We really do.
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:31.240]   Going to be a big week ahead, Jason. How what's happening?
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:40.240]   Hey, thanks, Leo. Here is a look at a few things we're going to be keeping a close eye on in the week ahead. First off, Computex actually kicks off in Taipei.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:54.240]   I usually see some interesting kind of Windows 10 developments devices also some Android devices there. So I'm sure we'll see a couple of devices rolling out also augmented world Expo happens starting Wednesday, June 1.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:04:03.240]   This is the world's largest AR and VR Expo. Man, I wish I could go there and check out some of this stuff. We're actually going to have a team there to cover the event.
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:12.240]   So someone's going there and we'll have lots of coverage for you next week. Developers building Apple Watch OS apps should mark June 1st on their calendar.
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:24.240]   That's the day that Apple requires that watch apps be native apps, meaning that they can be untethered to a device. So if you're developing watch apps, definitely want to look out for that also on June 1st.
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:32.240]   June 1st is a big day. Comcast opens up its data cap from 300 gigs to one terabyte of data that might save you.
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:39.240]   If you're thinking about getting an unlimited plan or whatever, Comcast is opening it up and that's a good deal. Check out Tech News today.
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:48.240]   We record every Monday through Friday at 4pm Pacific, 7pm Eastern, myself and make a Maroney. We're on set talking about all these stories and a whole lot more.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:54.240]   So you should definitely check it out at twit.tv/live. That's it for the week ahead. Back to you, Leo.
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:05:03.240]   Thank you, Jason Howell. Monday through Friday, 4pm Pacific. As he said, 7pm Eastern Tech News today. Our show today brought to you by our Ring Video Doorbell.
[02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:11.240]   Oh, I love this thing. I love my ring. I have it on my front door. You have it on your back door. Stacey.
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:16.240]   No, it was who had it on the back door. Was it you, Phil? It was you, Stacey.
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:17.240]   It is me.
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:23.240]   Yeah. I love it because it's a doorbell that connects. It's an Internet of Things device. It connects to your Wi-Fi.
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:30.240]   It replaces your existing doorbell. One of the problems with the doorbell is, of course, I can never hear it in the house. The chime goes, "Pong, pong."
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:37.240]   So this replaces it and not only does the chime still ring, but your phone or your tablet or anything, everything rings.
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:41.240]   They've got ring apps for iOS, for Android. They even have a ring app now for the Macintosh.
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:47.240]   And so you'll never miss somebody at their doorbell, even if you're not at home because it is attached to the Internet.
[02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:53.240]   So you hear the phone ring. I hear it here at work. Then, of course, it's got a wide-angle HD camera on it.
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:06:03.240]   Microphone and speaker too. You can talk to who's at your door. You can say, "Oh, sorry. I'm in the shower, so don't break into my house, bad guy."
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:10.240]   Which, by the way, happens a lot. They tend to come during... apparently, I didn't know this, but the stats say they come.
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:15.240]   But 95% of burglaries come during the day that bad guy comes to the door, knocks on the door, rings the doorbell.
[02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:20.240]   You don't answer, goes around the back, it breaks in. Well, now you've got crystal clear video of the bad guy.
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:24.240]   And you can tell him, "Go away. I'm inside, even if you're not."
[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:29.240]   The Ring video doorbell, it's easy to install and install it myself. Looks great. They have a variety of finishes.
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:39.240]   Go to ring.com and get free FedEx shipping on the original Ring video doorbell at ring.com/twit.
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:48.240]   This is just a great idea. I feel like it'd be great not only for you, but for family members, maybe your parents or whoever.
[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:54.240]   Give them a little sense of security. Ring.com/twit. We thank them so much for their support.
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:07:02.240]   Of our show. Great panel today from Mashable Christina Warren. Always wonderful to have film girl on the show.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:13.240]   From Stacey on IOT and the IOT podcast, Stacey Higginbotham, IOTpodcast.com. Giga Stacey on the Twitter.
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:20.240]   And of course, Philip Elmer-Dewitt, P-E-D at P-E-D-30.com.
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:31.240]   Last story, Steve Baker writing in Quora. Now Steve Baker is a designer of simulation of aircraft simulators, flight simulators for pilots.
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:41.240]   He's been doing that for over 25 years. And he says, "Forget about it. There's no way VR is ever going to work.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:52.240]   These devices have been around forever." He says, "I've been using them for years and years and years. And the problem isn't latency. It's not screen resolution.
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:58.240]   All the things that the companies like Oculus and Vive say it is. The problem is depth perception."
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:10.240]   See, and he says, "The problem is that your eyes are converging really close, but the objects you're looking at are sometimes distant.
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:17.240]   You have a disconnect in your caveman brain." He says, "What happens when the convergent system says...
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:22.240]   An object is two meters away and the focusing system says it's six meters away."
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:33.240]   Well, according to our caveman evolved brain, we're hallucinating. We must have eaten something terrible. Throw it up.
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:44.240]   Your brain goes into panic mode, tries to empty this substance. Now, he says, "This is going to happen. People will always get sick with VR displays unless the content is further than around three meters from them."
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:53.240]   And of course, that excludes any kind of application that happens inside a building because the floor is always less than three meters away from you unless you're nine-foot-tile alien.
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:09:05.240]   And he quotes not just his own thesis, but the United States Navy and the US Army, both of which did extensive studies on sim sickness.
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:16.240]   And it's even worse than you might imagine, even without nausea. And maybe not everybody gets sick, but there's a measurable degree of confusion and disorientation after prolonged exposure to VR experiences.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:25.240]   The US military advises against flying a plane or even driving a car for 24 hours after being inside a simulator.
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:34.240]   "One question still not answered is the actual time course of the symptoms experienced by the aviators in the simulator and the recurrence of delayed effects.
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:47.240]   "An octodal data continues to be received indicating that there is a part of the aviation population that experiences delayed problems beyond the simulator exposure and for periods that exceed six to eight hours.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:53.240]   That's approximately eight percent of the population and for a smaller group, one to two days.
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:10:03.240]   Studies should be conducted to determine which scenarios are linked with simulator sickness and methods to prepare aviators to deal with these scenarios, but you shouldn't be driving a car.
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:15.240]   Let alone piling an aircraft." So Baker points out, "Look, we're going to put a lot of these devices in people's hands, not just the Oculus and the Vive, but also the PlayStation VR, which is due out.
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:21.240]   I love them." He says, "But if you go to the labs where they're making these guys don't wear them for very long, they know.
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:27.240]   And we're going to have all sorts of problems of people driving under the influence of VR."
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:34.240]   What do you think? I have to say, Christine, I bet you've played a lot with these. What's the longest you've spent?
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:38.240]   I have. I don't know, maybe like an hour and a half.
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:41.240]   And when you took it off, were you disoriented? It was life.
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:46.240]   A little bit. A little bit that I didn't feel drunk. I mean, look, I don't drive again, so I kind of feel safe.
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:50.240]   You're safe in the subway, yeah. I'm safe in the subway. Yeah, but I mean, a little bit.
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:59.240]   I have to say, over time, it's gotten a lot better. I mean, I've seen huge improvements just from like the original, like DK2 Oculus to the shipped version.
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:13.240]   And the Vive, I think, is a good experience, too. So I understand the concerns, and I think they're really valid, but I always feel weird about any prognestications that like, this is an unsolvable problem.
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:20.240]   Because I feel like technology moves so quickly, and we thought that's about other things in the past, and then it turns out there are solutions.
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:27.240]   So I bet I do think it's a valid concern, and I do think it's one of those things that we do have to consider as VR becomes a bigger and bigger deal.
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:31.240]   And I think that this is one of the things why there are so many people are hesitant about VR, right?
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:35.240]   Because it's not just nausea, but it's depth for perceptions, other things.
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:45.240]   The general consensus is not that this is going to necessarily be the next big thing. It's kind of a toss-up between is this 3D TV or is this, you know, smartphones.
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:12:03.240]   And I don't really know the answer of what it's going to be yet, but I definitely think that what he wrote has raises a lot of interesting questions and are definitely things that I'm sure everybody at all these companies, I'm sure they're thinking about these issues and are investing in heavy research and development to solve these sorts of problems, too.
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:06.240]   He says we've had 20 years. We've known about this forever.
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:15.240]   Well, I mean, that's fair, but at the same time, I mean, they've had 20 years and yet it was, you know, a kid who kind of helped kind of come up with like kind of a lot of implementation.
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:21.240]   Yeah, but the modern implementation, the big story there is really not that he improved VR, but he got the price down.
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:31.240]   Because I remember 30 years ago getting in a VR, you know, rig and riding a pterodactyl at SIGGRAPH92, and it was exactly the same experience.
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:37.240]   In fact, probably arguably, he says a better experience, lower latency, higher resolution displays, more accurate head tracking.
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:44.240]   The big advance of Palmer Lucky and the rest is they got the price down because it used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:45.240]   Sure.
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:47.240]   I get sick every time I'm in VR.
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:49.240]   So it is my wife.
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:51.240]   I wish I didn't.
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:53.240]   I'm like, everyone's like, this is the way to be.
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:58.240]   And I'm like, after about five minutes and everyone's like, it'll go away over time, but so far it hasn't.
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:12:59.240]   Yeah.
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:04.240]   So I feel like if this is the next big thing, I feel kind of screwed as a writer.
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:10.240]   What the industry tells us is, oh, no, no, no, we're getting the latency down between turning the head and the picture moving and that's going to fix it.
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:11.240]   I don't think it does.
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:24.240]   Now he points out that cardboard, Google's VR doesn't have that problem as much because you base because they've said that mostly these applications where you're not moving, you're just turning your head around.
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:25.240]   Right.
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:26.240]   That makes sense.
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:33.240]   I'm going to point out that people said that 3D movies and TV would die for a similar reason, that your eyes are converging on one distance.
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:35.240]   Your focal point is a different distance.
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:45.240]   So the theater screen is 60 feet away, but you see it twig three feet away and your brain is saying you can't converge at one distance and focus at another distance.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.240]   Throw up your hallucinating.
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:50.240]   I find this fascinating.
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:58.240]   It's a big story because frankly, this is going to be a multi-billion dollar industry and if it makes people nauseous or worse causes car accidents, we get a problem.
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:00.240]   Maybe it'll be a 30 billion dollar.
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:02.240]   I mean, it's not the smartphone.
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:10.240]   And just because the smartphone is so huge, I mean, to be able to put the internet in your pocket is a, that's a hard thing to match for any technology.
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:16.240]   Well, my only experience is with the cardboard and showing the cardboard to people.
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:25.240]   And what's so cool is you show them this and it's really cheap technology and it's like the scales have fallen off their eyes and they say, "Oh, wow, this is amazing."
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:26.240]   I agree.
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:30.240]   But then they don't, you know, then what's next?
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:32.240]   And I can see it for gamers.
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:34.240]   That's definitely a market.
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:43.240]   And I can see it for porn and maybe for training airplane pilots, but, you know, how big is that?
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:44.240]   Yeah.
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:48.240]   So like the internet, so the smartphone put the internet in your pocket, right?
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:54.240]   The idea behind VR and why everyone wants to spend so much money on it is because you conceivably could put the world in your pocket.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.240]   Not today.
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:56.240]   It's more like the PC.
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:10.240]   But I mean, if your biggest problem is, you know, the internet change distribution models, you know, sending digital bits around, VR is a way to kind of turn atoms into bits in some way.
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:11.240]   Not exactly.
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:12.240]   You know, you can't-
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:13.240]   We'll put you places.
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:14.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:15.240]   And that's exciting.
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:16.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:17.240]   But I agree.
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:18.240]   Yeah, I still get sick.
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:19.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:20.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:23.240]   Some, I think some percentage of people will always get sick.
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:24.240]   No, I can't be one of those.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:25.240]   I'll be left behind.
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:28.240]   No, I don't think you have to feel bad about it.
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:30.240]   I don't think you have to feel bad about it.
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:31.240]   Lisa gets sick.
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:32.240]   She can't do it.
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:34.240]   I'll be looking at stuff and saying, "Oh, this is so cool.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.240]   You got to try it."
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:36.240]   She puts it on.
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:37.240]   She goes, "Oh."
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:43.240]   Because you guys have a better evolved system to prevent eating magic mushrooms than we do.
[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:45.240]   I feel like I could do that just fine.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:48.240]   I don't know.
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:49.240]   You know, I don't know.
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:51.240]   It was an interesting article I found at Thought Provoking.
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:54.240]   It was on Quora, you know, which is a strange place to find something like that.
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:57.240]   But I thought that was quite interesting.
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:02.240]   Folks, we've run out of time, but we have had a blast, and I'm so glad that you all were
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:03.240]   here.
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:04.240]   I thank you, Stacey.
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:07.240]   I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more of you on Twig.
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:10.240]   We're thrilled to have you as part of the team.
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:14.240]   You can find Stacey's podcast at the IoT.
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:15.240]   What is it?
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:16.240]   Iotpodcast.com.
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:19.240]   I don't want to say the Iotpodcast.com.
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:22.240]   That's the show she does with Kevin Tofel.
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.240]   Kevin's a regular, right?
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:26.240]   Kevin's on every week.
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:31.240]   You're already up to episode 60, which is nice.
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:32.240]   Very nice.
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:37.240]   Of course, you can read about her IoT stuff.
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:39.240]   Is it Stacey on Iot?
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:40.240]   Yes.
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:41.240]   That's the newsletter.
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:42.240]   It's we.
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:43.240]   Oh, that's the newsletter.
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:44.240]   Where do we get that?
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:47.240]   You go to Stacey on Iot.com to sign up.
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:51.240]   I don't have a web place yet because I haven't figured out my strategy there.
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:52.240]   I know.
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:53.240]   I don't have a problem.
[02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:57.240]   Well, I will follow you anywhere.
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:58.240]   Sign up for it.
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:16:59.240]   It's free.
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:02.240]   Stacey on Iot.com.
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:08.240]   And Phillip Elmer DeWitt leaving his cushy job to start his own thing.
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:09.240]   God bless you for doing it.
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:11.240]   I think it's a great idea.
[02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:14.240]   P-E-D-3-0.com.
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:19.240]   And anything, what are you working on?
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:21.240]   Oh, you know, the news never ends with Apple.
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:25.520]   Let me just say about the website, it's $10 a month or $100 a year.
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:30.320]   But if you don't want to pay, wait three days and the pay law lifts and it's all free.
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.240]   That's a clever way to do it.
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:36.240]   If you're behind a paywall, you sort of become invisible on the internet.
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:38.240]   So this is my way around it.
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:39.240]   Yeah.
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:43.120]   I look at people like Ben Thompson and Hars De DeWitt and see, I really feel like there is
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:50.880]   an opportunity for somebody to smart and has a unique voice to do just fine in a situation
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:51.880]   like this.
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:53.520]   Jason Stell, absolutely.
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:57.960]   When are we going to get you out of your day job, Christina Warren at Mashable.com?
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:58.960]   I think about it.
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:17:59.960]   I think about it.
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:01.760]   Oh, but you're such a good job.
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:02.880]   I do have a good job.
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:08.160]   So yeah, but it is always one of those things, especially I talked to you like Stacy and
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:10.840]   Phillip who are kind of doing it and looking at what Jason's done.
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:12.760]   It's always one of those things you think, could I?
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:13.760]   I don't know.
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:14.760]   But it's always tempting.
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:19.480]   But you know what, let me tell you, and I'm sure that Stacy and Phillip will agree,
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:22.360]   there are also some serious challenges.
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:25.680]   And it's a little scary, frankly, you know, the things are going well.
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:28.040]   No reason to, you know, here's the thing.
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:31.120]   Don't, don't tell cash more of this.
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:35.440]   But the truth is, and people do this to me too, you're using his platform to build your
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:38.320]   brand and just continue to do so.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:42.280]   And at some point your brand is big enough that you can, you know, you're getting, you're
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:46.040]   building up steam, you're going down that runway.
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:49.160]   It's in any moment now you could lift off, you know, you just get that brand to the point
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:50.160]   where you lift off.
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:51.320]   That's all.
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:52.320]   Use me.
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:53.320]   Use me too.
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:54.320]   We love having you on.
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:55.320]   We'll see a lot more of you.
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:56.320]   I know Christina Warren.
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:57.320]   Thank you.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:02.040]   We do Twitter every Sunday, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200 UTC.
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:05.520]   If you want to join us live, want to be in the audience, email tickets at twitter.tv.
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:06.880]   We'd love to see it.
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:13.240]   If you can't be here in person or on the tubes, the inner tubes or in the chatroom at irc.tv,
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:20.280]   you do have on demand audio and video of every show we do at our website, twit.tv or you
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:25.760]   can use your podcast app of choice and subscribe and make sure you get every episode, audio
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:26.840]   or video.
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:28.920]   We don't care as long as you join us every week.
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:29.920]   Thanks for being here.
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:30.920]   We'll see you next time.
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:31.920]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:32.920]   Bye bye.
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:32.920]   Yay.
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:33.920]   Do the twit.
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:34.920]   All right.
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:35.920]   Do the twit, baby.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:36.920]   Do the twit.
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:37.920]   All right.
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:38.920]   Do the twit.
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:39.920]   All right.
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:40.920]   Do the twit.
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:41.920]   All right.
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:42.920]   Do the twit.
