[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.520]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   Not anymore.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.080]   Patrick Norton is here from TechTang.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   Not an expert.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.320]   Not an expert, but he plays one on TV.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   So that's okay.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   On the internet.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.320]   On the internet.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   On TV, on the internet.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   On TV, internet.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   TV, internet.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   Internet TV.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   Video.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.040]   I bet you're an expert at internet TV.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.160]   You know, let me, let's just not put the audience asleep this early.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   Okay.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.160]   I don't want to talk about encoding.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.160]   There's some good stuff.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   I want to talk about RSS feeds.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160]   No, there's good stuff to talk about.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.160]   Yes.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   But we'll get to that.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.920]   Also, with this John C. Devorek.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920]   D stands for.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.480]   C.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.480]   See you later.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   See you later.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   Cryptography.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.680]   We can't sync that or we'll get.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   Yes.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.680]   No agenda show.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.680]   I missed you.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.680]   Oh, God.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   It didn't take long.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680]   I get that.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680]   I got to get it in.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680]   I missed you.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680]   I haven't seen you in like it's been months and months.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.680]   You've been one month.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   You were in DC?
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.680]   Were you in DC?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.680]   I was not in DC.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.680]   Was I in DC?
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680]   I was told you were in Washington, DC.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680]   I was in Washington.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.320]   I was in Washington state.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.320]   Oh, never mind.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.560]   All right.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.520]   I had these, this whole thing, you know.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   Mr. Devorek goes back in Washington.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.520]   Yeah, you know what I mean.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.640]   Speaking of cold, Philip Elmer DeWitt's here underneath six feet of snow in Massachusetts.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.080]   Well, Boston had six feet.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.960]   We had about three and a half feet here in Greenfield.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   Oh, you're a punter.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   Now, why would the city get more snow?
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.960]   It's right there.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   It's on the Gulf Stream.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   It should be warmer.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.320]   You're in Western Massachusetts, right?
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   Right.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.280]   But it's because the city's on the sea.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.120]   It's, you know, there's more moisture to make more.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.160]   You know, generally these storms have been coming up the coast and dumping the last
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.720]   thing you know on the coast and less inland.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.080]   Philip's a regular for, you were time's first computer writer.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.480]   Now I write a blog for Fortune About Apple.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.560]   A blog for Fortune About Apple.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.680]   Sounds like your world is kind of narrowed.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   Yeah, boy.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   I love it.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   I love it.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.720]   There's nothing, you know, there's not a beat is a gift.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   Yes.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.280]   You only have to worry about one thing.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.160]   My email address, if you want to put it up there, is p-e-d at mac.com.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.600]   And if you've got any leaks or stories, actually I'm curious what you think about this focacca,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.360]   in my opinion, Reuters story that Apple's getting to self-driving cars.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.120]   Well, you know, so that was a business insider rumor that they just spun and spun and spun
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.320]   and that Reuters picked it up.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.120]   Just doesn't speak very well for Reuters.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   Reuters says, "According to an anonymous source," which always makes me a little bit nervous,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:47.320]   "the source who declined to be named said that Apple is interested in making cars, not
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   individual components or automotive software, but they want to build cars, probably self-driving
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.320]   cars."
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.680]   This sounds like a hoax.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.640]   It sounds like the Apple TV rumor.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.000]   Well, you know, that was funny because of some basis.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.120]   Because the monster, Gene Munster, who has been pushed, he's been saying that the Apple
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   TV is just a year away.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.120]   It was his fabrication.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   Seven years, right?
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   That was all in.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.760]   So he said, "Well, we're going to get an Apple TV before we get an self-driving car."
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:29.080]   Someone pointed out to me that, and I think he's right, someone pointed out that in testimony
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.880]   Eddy Q said that, or no, it was Schiller said that they were working on a car before
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.240]   they decided to make the phone, which makes the Apple car idea what?
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.480]   Eight years old already, nine years old already.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.760]   You have to know how to make cars first, and you have to know how, before you can make
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.240]   a self-driving car, right?
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.200]   It seems like a big chunk to do.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   But it may have to go on the cash.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.520]   Wall Street Journal on Friday confirmed it.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.440]   They said Apple has set up a secret lab working on the creation.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.280]   It's just so ridiculous to me.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.880]   Of an Apple branded electric car citing people familiar with the matter.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.120]   That's almost as good as an anonymous source.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.680]   The lab was set up late last year.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.040]   Soon after Apple revealed its forthcoming smartwatch, the journal said the Apple project, code
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.400]   named Titan, employed several hundred people working a few miles from Apple's headquarters
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.000]   in Cupertino.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.200]   And apparently they've met with contract manufacturers, Patrick, you're a car guy.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.080]   Do you know the name Magna Steyer in Austria?
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.240]   A unit of Magna International.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.600]   I've heard it at least once.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   Do they make cars?
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.640]   I have no idea what they make it.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.440]   Well, so autonomous vehicles are coming.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.280]   Autonomous vehicles at the luxury level will probably be here in 2020, right?
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.400]   Magna, by the way, makes automotive systems.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   I mean, we already have assisted driving.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   It's really cool assisted driving stuff is going to hit 2016, 2017.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.960]   Depending on who you're asking, 2018 to 2020, you're talking about a fairly sophisticated
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.320]   level of autonomous vehicle.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.400]   I'd like to take a moment to point out that everybody thought Tesla was going to fall
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.840]   on its face.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.800]   Everybody thought, "Oh, yeah, the PayPal guy is going to start a car company."
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.440]   Nobody really, I mean, who would have thought that Apple could have pulled together the
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   iPhone.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.080]   And judging from the stories, there was a beautiful story in the New York Times where
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.840]   they talked about sort of behind the scenes at the debut of the original iPhone.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   Wasn't that a great story?
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.440]   That was from a book called Dogfight, which is the Apple Google battle.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.440]   And you could just smell the bailing liar in that story.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.680]   They were just keeping it together.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.160]   And then they shipped the cars on time.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.640]   While Steve Jobs is demonstrating the first iPhone in 2007, are sitting in the front rows
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.920]   at Moscone West, taking a shot every time a bit of the demo works because they know
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.800]   that there's a distinct path that Jobs could follow.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.160]   And if he deviates in the least, the iPhones will crash.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   They just won't do it.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   And then they will be finding new jobs.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   Right.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   So they're taking a shot.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.000]   He said, "By the end of the demo, we were drunk, but we were ecstatic because it worked."
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   This is a good thing.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Isn't it a great story?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   It's a great story.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It was just to interrupt.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.040]   It's possible because it's always been Apple's contention that because of Eric being on the
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:23.960]   board that Apple should have owned the smartphone market a little longer than it did.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:30.320]   But the Google guys steal the product, essentially, make a copy, come up with their own operation.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.720]   This is kind of a get-back needle them and make it look because Google's the head of
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   the drive on this car.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.600]   So let's let Apple come in there and mess with them.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.160]   Do you mean just for fun, let's tie in the whole like, what's Uber worth now more than
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.720]   the EU at this point in terms of its market value, some insane number?
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.920]   I am not particularly an Uber enthusiast.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.400]   I am probably alone in the panel on that.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.640]   But if Apple thinks Uber is going to give Google a metric ton of money, if for no other
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.520]   reason than jerking around stock prices, would they start rumors on an autonomous car?
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.800]   I don't think Apple would do it just to mess with the--
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   Okay.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   I don't know.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   I don't know.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   That seems kind of childish.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   We have the next question.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   Philip Elmer do it.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   You're the Apple Apple ever will mess with it.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.440]   Would Apple be childish like that?
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.600]   I assume Apple is going to look at every possible product that they could monetize.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.200]   If there's a product that they could make better than anybody else makes it, they're
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.280]   going to look at trying to do it.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.920]   And it's perfectly, I believe the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times who've actually
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.320]   put automotive reporters on this store, which is why we're starting to get some detail
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.080]   and some names and some numbers of people.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.240]   So they're working on it.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.800]   They could be doing any number of things.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.920]   They could be building Apple's version of Google's Street View.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.920]   That car that we saw driving around with all those cars.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.920]   What was that car?
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.920]   Was it an autonomous vehicle?
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.920]   Was it a Street View car?
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   What was it?
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.960]   Well, Apple doesn't have a permit to drive autonomous vehicles.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.560]   So it's unlikely that it was.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.440]   But there's a number of things it could have been doing.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.000]   One of them is making really good maps to compete with Google Maps.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It could have been making really good maps to try out an autonomous vehicle.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.080]   They're going to look at it.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   They've got smart people.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.800]   They're going to hire smart people.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.040]   Maybe it'll be a product.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.040]   Maybe it won't.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.720]   They're going to do that kind of stuff.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   Google does that, too.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.480]   They've got enough cash to say, "Let's see what happens here."
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:33.000]   A couple going a little bit macroed, though.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.600]   Munster points out that investors are always looking for, "Is it possible that Apple has
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.960]   another winner somewhere that they're working on in a secret lab?"
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   So it doesn't hurt for the stock's value to float this kind of rumor.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.440]   Then it also, someone else pointed out that you've got a lot of really smart engineers
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.920]   at Apple who are must be getting sick of doing the iPhone 5, the iPhone 5s, the iPhone
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   6, the iPhone 6s.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.640]   That's pretty boring for a real smart engineer.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.400]   So to have a new project that's completely different, that's not another iPhone, could
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.840]   keep these guys around because otherwise they're going to leave.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   Here's a question for you.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:21.040]   Would an Apple car have a break in accelerator pedal or wouldn't they just want to combine
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.160]   the two into one-level button?
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160]   Or maybe...
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   No button.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   No button.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.160]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   You wave at it.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.040]   So maybe you go like this and the car goes forward, you go like this and it slows down,
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.520]   you swipe left to turn left, swipe right to turn right.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.040]   Well, I think the Apple way...
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.280]   Yeah, that's exactly what I want.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.080]   Well, there's no reason in terms of low or high speed maneuvering, you couldn't use
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.440]   a joystick to do it, right?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.440]   There's adaptive driving systems that like the drive cars.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   You can like it the same way.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.440]   You just lean in the direction you want the car to go.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.880]   And you'll never have an accident, right?
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.080]   Because people don't figure out ways to have accidents with superior technology.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.160]   So one of the chapters says, "Take the drugs off Leo someone."
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.760]   Well, 2016 is a...
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.200]   I'm pretty sure 2016, it is...
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.240]   As of 2016, it will be legal to test...
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   Look at the drugs.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   Sorry.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.680]   Now, I think as of 2016, it will be legal in the state of California to test vehicles
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.400]   without steering wheels or pedals.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.360]   I don't know if that's a Wikipedia hack.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.000]   No, I believe it because if you look at the Google self...
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.920]   The current Google self driving car doesn't have any controls.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.960]   You get in and it goes and you don't...
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.960]   It's a little...
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.040]   I think consumers are not going to want that because they're going to want the feeling
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.680]   that, "Well, I could override this if I wanted to."
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.720]   Well, eventually they're just going to do...
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.520]   You saw that Mercedes Benz, it basically was a living room on wheels.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.760]   The concept car from CES.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.120]   Sure, I read about that in a William Gibson novel for 25 years ago.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.040]   It looked like it also you could turn off the windows so you wouldn't have to see what's
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.280]   going on outside, which I would need.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   Or so the people outside couldn't see what you were doing.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   See, you were doing the car on I-5.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.280]   I need that as well.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   I'll follow up here.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.040]   Alright, so Phillip, you're giving some credibility to the...
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.720]   And I guess she writes this is the journal of financial times.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.440]   It's a lot of sources now at this point.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.200]   Yeah, I mean, they've hired people.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.680]   But you know, Apple doesn't usually come out with products until other people have sort
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.640]   of perfected the idea and the public's ready for it.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.800]   And then they'll make the best car or whatever kind of car they're making.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.680]   Seriously, this is a new Apple.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.960]   You got to acknowledge that it's not necessarily good.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.600]   That's how they've always done it in the past.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.640]   But I don't think there's any reason to think Tim Cook wouldn't want to break some new ground
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.640]   too, right?
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.920]   Well, but they're not going to make a product till the public's ready by large numbers.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.920]   They can get their...
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.920]   They're focused on profits.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.080]   They're not focused on blue sky research.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.600]   I'd agree with that.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.200]   Although when you have, when you have...
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   They've got enough money.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   160 billion in cash.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.000]   Don't make it don't get in the resource or something.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   They'll do that away.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.720]   Yeah, they'll do the blue sky research.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.000]   They just won't release a product until it's right.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Right.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Or word of it.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.600]   And remember when Cook was talking to Charlie Rose last fall, he said, "We are working on
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   stuff that has never been rumored.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.600]   No one has said anything about it that no one knows about."
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.400]   So maybe that's what he was talking about.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   Linen's.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   Linen's.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   There's all kinds of...
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.400]   There's all kinds of...
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   I buy Apple.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   I buy Apple in it.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.800]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.600]   When we come back, we have much more to talk about.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.200]   Philip Elmer DeWitt from Fortune Magazine is here.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.800]   And it's not too snowy where he is.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   So that's nice.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.800]   John C. DeVorak.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   Stop today.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.560]   John C. DeVorak is here from noagendashow.com.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.400]   That crackpot podcast where anything goes.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.960]   It's not crackpot in the least.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.400]   You haven't listened to it for probably three years.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.000]   I've never listened to it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   But then you wouldn't know.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.720]   The False Flags Show, right?
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.600]   That's where you talk about False Flags.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   What is it called?
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   False Flag?
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.600]   Noagendashow.com.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   Yeah, okay.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.600]   Find out more about that there.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.560]   We have a bunch of people that write in and say, "You know, I haven't heard about you
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.240]   talking about this show for the last three years.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.240]   I finally listened to it."
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.240]   It's not bad.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240]   I'm thinking.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.240]   No, I'm thinking.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.240]   What kind of push is it?
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.320]   What is Leo's shit because they say I'm listening to the Twitter?
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   I hear you.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:05.080]   I'm thinking, "Is it take three years for me to sell somebody just to listen to a show?"
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.920]   People on the other hand are buying mattresses from one end.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920]   And they are.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.880]   And I think if you'd say something good about the show.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   I could help you.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   He said, "I never listened to it."
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.040]   I have never listened to it.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.200]   So how can I recommend it?
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   Well maybe you should listen to it and recommend it.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   Then I'd be making video.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.200]   Have you ever listened to Noah Jenda?
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   I have.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   What do you think?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   I think it's a sophisticated discussion of ideas that-
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   No it's not.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   How would you know?
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   I get so.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   You never listened to it.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.160]   Because you and Curry are on it.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.280]   Oh, you know, you hate Curry.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   I don't hate Curry.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.280]   I just question his-
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.280]   No, no, no.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.280]   Middle facilities.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.280]   You hate him.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.280]   I don't hate him.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.280]   I know a thing about him.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   I wish I could get you two together.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.280]   You'd love each other.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.240]   You know, this is a wonderful time to thank the people that bring Twitch.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.720]   I'm going to do an ad, but the only time I've talked to Adam Curry, he said, "You know,
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.760]   you should come to work for me at Mevio."
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   There, Adam, glad I'm going to do that.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.280]   You've had him on the show a couple of times.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.960]   No, but I mean the time in person because it was actually on Cranky Yeekes.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.760]   He said, "I could pay you a wife leaving money."
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   That was it on him.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.600]   That was the last time I talked to him.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.240]   You never told me this story before.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.720]   The hell is that?
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.400]   And why would you even say that?
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   That's creepy.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.280]   I've got a better word for that kind of money, but I can't say it.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.520]   Yeah, don't say it out loud.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.520]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.920]   Anyway, I had my radio engineer today.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.920]   He said, "I don't know.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.960]   I think that call or swear."
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.320]   Swore.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.320]   And I had to dump him.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   I said, "What did he say?"
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.680]   He said, "I think he said the effing Google."
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680]   No, he said, "No."
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   He said, "Facebook and Google."
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:37.360]   So, if you were listening to the radio show and there was a 40-second chunk missing, it's
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.000]   because somebody said, "Facebook and Google."
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.880]   So fast that it sounded like effing Google.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   Or maybe he said effing Google.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.280]   Why do you say effing is not something you'd cut?
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.280]   He didn't say effing.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.720]   He said the full Anglo-explitive.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   I can't say it.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.720]   Oh, why not?
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.560]   This is a podcast.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.800]   It's family-friendly.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   We try to make it.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.840]   You know why, because John will come over here and hit me.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.800]   I did say it just the other day and he came over and I'm slightly upset.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   Did he hit you?
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   No, but he practically did.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   I could tell he wanted to.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   Oh, I think that's true with a lot of people that work here.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.120]   They all want to hit me.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.680]   Thank you, I'll be your oldie.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   I'm not.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:16.240]   On Friday I had lunch, actually dinner in San Francisco with a lovely man named Bill Harris.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.240]   You know Bill?
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.000]   Bill is the, he was a founder of PayPal with Elon Musk.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.920]   Boy, he had some choice words about Elon Musk, which someday we'll talk about.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.920]   I'm going to bring him back to the drink.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   There's a lot of people that have these issues.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   It was interesting.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.960]   So he and Elon were like the founders of PayPal.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.320]   He also was CEO and to a-
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.120]   Of course, Peter Tile fit into the scheme.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   Came later.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.120]   Oh.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.320]   I mean, really, I mean, this is like at the very beginning.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.320]   There's a PayPal.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   Some great stories.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.240]   I'm going to get Bill back on triangulation because I didn't even know all this the first
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.480]   time we had him on.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.000]   When he was on then, he'd mentioned, and it wasn't even on the show.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.840]   He mentioned I'm starting a new company called Personal Capital and I said, and he told
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.200]   me all about it.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.280]   And I signed up and I am really glad I did because Personal Capital, it's two years
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.800]   down the road now and I'm still using it, is a really great way to keep track of where
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.280]   your money is, how it's going.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.040]   But it's more than just a financial dashboard.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.720]   It's really the goal of it is to keep you up to date on your investments for retirement
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:15.880]   for planning for the future to make sure that your 401(k) is not getting shaved by brokerage
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.040]   fees or high mutual fund fees that your retirement plan is working.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.240]   You're not losing years off your retirement because of expenses.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.680]   It's a really great solution.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   You put in your stuff, it's completely secure.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.240]   It'll give you a single screen dashboard on your computer, on your tablet, on your phone,
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.400]   they even have an Android watch app, which is so cool.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.000]   Seriously, just the other day it said, time to rebalance because you're now getting a
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.240]   little heavy in international.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.160]   And that was great to see that on my watch and I went home and I did.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.520]   Anyway, that's the beginning.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.720]   Now you can invest with Personal Capital for a limited time when you open a new Personal

[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.640]   Personal Capital dot com slash Tuit and I am going to get bill up because he had some
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.640]   stories.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:51.720]   He also worked for Mort Zuckerman when Zuckerman first bought the Atlantic and he came in help
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.880]   to run the business side of the Atlantic and US News and World of War.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.280]   It's very interesting stories.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.280]   That's the stuff.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:06.760]   He told the story at one point when he was visiting Mort Zuckerman and his house in
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.560]   Southampton looking out the ocean in beautiful day.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:15.600]   Zuckerman just bought the Atlantic monthly and he was trying to bring it up.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.600]   Tell his neighbor.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.320]   He couldn't figure out a way to kind of get his.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.000]   So he finally just said, you know, I bought the Atlantic.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And his name is an ocean.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   His neighbor said that's a shame.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   I used to like to swim in that.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.680]   And you never know what he's being here all the week.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.680]   Thank you.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   You had one.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   I get one.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   Okay.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:42.120]   Philip, you just wrote an article about beats and Jimmy Iovine and I saw this was kind of
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:49.800]   interesting that apparently a very popular DJ for Radio 1 on the BBC in England, Zane
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.840]   Lowe was just hired by Apple.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   I presume that has something to do with beats.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.840]   What's going on?
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.240]   Well, you know, who the hell knows?
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.560]   But we're just we're like a criminologist trying to figure out what's going on.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.320]   I love the story that Billboard did about the Grammys because it gave you a feeling
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320]   for what's going on.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:19.740]   You've got that they describe this scene where Clive Davis is pre Grammy gala where Tim Cook
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:28.000]   shows up and 80 Q and Robert Condick who runs iTunes and Jimmy Iovine and Al Gore and Nancy
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Pelosi.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.560]   And it's like the white hot center of this party.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:41.240]   And there's a line a single file line of record industry executives, you know, lined
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.080]   up to see these guys.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:50.640]   And there's a Q, you know, playing sort of, you know, it's like a scene out of the sweet
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:58.040]   smell of success and he's playing Sidney Falco to Iovine's JJ from Stackker and everybody,
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:04.480]   you know, wants to want to kiss the ring and would clearly they're making deals.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.720]   And according to Billboard, they've been, you know, Iovine's been talking to one record
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   label after another.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.800]   According to Apple and Sider, they've been signing up exclusive deals with artists so
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:26.440]   that when an artist comes out with a new CD, it gets played first and exclusively on whatever
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.400]   they're going to call iTunes Beats streaming service.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:37.920]   So it's going to be very hard for Spotify and what's the other one Pandora to compete
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.640]   with this new streaming service if Apple gets everybody first.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.960]   So, and then the other thing is that they hire the most popular DJ in England.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.600]   You know, they take them off the radio and they put them in Cupertino and probably he's
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:23:01.040]   going to be part of what Jimmy Iovine calls deciding what song comes next.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.320]   This idea of curating music, you're going to get a streaming service and someone is going
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.800]   to decide what song comes next, who you trust.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.400]   And you know, like FM radio works, only it's now doesn't go over the radio.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   It feels kind of retro.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.280]   I mean, I think for people our age, maybe that makes sense, but kids don't.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.280]   Okay.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:27.200]   Spotify bought a company called the Echo Nest, which I think is Swedish, which was the
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.440]   recommendation engine behind Spotify, RDO.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.680]   Here we go, like I heart radio, Rhapsody, Xbox, music and a bunch of others.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.000]   And so a lot of people started pulling away from that.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Iovine's producer, right?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.040]   He's he's a hands on manipulative idea.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.760]   Well, and that was the pitch.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.320]   When they launched Beats, he said people want curation and that's that was the big difference
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   in people.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   We use music.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   You make a sentence.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   Yes.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   It's really dumb.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.400]   I thought it was interesting because interesting.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.560]   I'm not saying that.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.960]   But it's not something my son's going to do.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.560]   My son sits there and watches YouTube videos.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.960]   I think Google owns this because of the music key in YouTube.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.400]   Google doesn't own anything in terms of streaming music.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.240]   Apple has failed, excuse me, Apple has failed over and over again on streaming music.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   And now it's too late.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.960]   Everybody's choose RDO or Spotify or Google or Amazon.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.560]   There's so many competitors and I think everybody's invested in one of them.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.400]   Beats music when it launched was a failure.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   Was an outright failure.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.960]   Leo, how are you invested?
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   Aren't you switching?
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   It's not like you.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   Boom.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.960]   But yeah, it's not like you.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.200]   Well, you know the old thing.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.000]   Nobody's going to go to a new technology unless the new technology is significantly better
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.240]   than the old.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.200]   It's not just like, oh, that's a little bit better.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.360]   I would like to try it.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.320]   If you have it with Spotify, Beats has to make a proposition that is way beyond maybe
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.960]   an exclusivity is the key.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.120]   That would give you a pretty male if your Taylor Swift fan and you could only get it
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.520]   on Beats maybe.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   Maybe.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.520]   Exactly.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.520]   It's exactly it.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.560]   No, it's not like you've invested all this money and you downloaded the music and it
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.440]   only plays on Spotify.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.440]   No, that's right.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.040]   No, you know, all you do is flick a switch and you're streaming from somewhere else.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   So I think that's the key.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.280]   You've got to have exclusive, you've got to have a lot of exclusive content.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.120]   You can hear Tim Cook saying, we're not just going to make any streaming service.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.960]   We're going to make the best streaming service.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.760]   And then if they can deliver that, people will switch.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.560]   I'm just saying that Beats tried to do this and they got what?
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   110,000 subscribers.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.800]   Beats ain't there yet.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.040]   But Apple, you know, they've got 800 million iTunes accounts.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.840]   They've got 75% of the download market.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.600]   They've got Jimmy Ivine, who's, you know, he's amazing Jimmy Ivine.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.080]   He saw, you know, that you look at the list of people that he signed up and, you know,
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.840]   his career and music, I hear I have it somewhere here.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.840]   What is he did?
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.480]   He, you know, former recording engineer, John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, turned record
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.640]   producer Patty Smith, Tom Petty, you two dire straits, et cetera, et cetera, co-founded
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   Inner Scope.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.120]   Yeah, those all sound like really old acts.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.560]   Eminem, Eminem, to Lady Gaga, you know, he's got the new people too.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.360]   Beats, the guy, I mean, the guy, essentially, you know, he and Dre and whatever involvement,
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.160]   you know, Monster had or didn't have at that point, essentially created an entire market
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.040]   for premium headphones that didn't exist.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.680]   Not very good headphones, but they established a huge market for incredibly expensive headphones
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.840]   so that the entire industry is now following and trying to emulate.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.880]   They made an hit, they made them relevant.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.560]   But isn't the music, I'm surprised to hear that everybody was flocking around Jimmy Ivine
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:45.080]   at the, at the Clive Davis party because it's pretty clear that the music industry is not
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.520]   fond of streaming music that they feel like they're not getting their share.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.840]   Yeah, well, there's that, but there's too late to, this is not changing.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.320]   Well, you know that and I know that, but does some record industry know that?
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   Sure, they do.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320]   And they have a big thing.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:04.000]   They just baffled me at the during the Grammy Awards ceremony, they had a big chunk of time
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.560]   devoted to basically, you guys are thieves, but we're going to go to Congress and make
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   sure you're not.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.240]   I mean, that's literally what that was all about.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.600]   And they thanked the turtles, because the turtles sued streaming industry over his pre-1972
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.800]   music and Taylor Swift, because literally out loud said, thanks to turtles and Taylor
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.520]   Swift, we're going to win this battle.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.080]   Taylor Swift pulled her music at a Spotify.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.520]   They don't like these streaming guys.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.400]   It may be the future, but they don't like them.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.760]   But there's also a lot of artists that have, and this is not a new story, have pointed
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.600]   out that you actually, no, I make nearly nothing, but my record company makes these.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.280]   Yeah, well, we know that too, but remember, it's the record company is making these deals.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.680]   And yeah, this is, yeah, this is not a new situation, but if, if, if Apple puts money
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.680]   into beats to create exclusive deals where people start making money, Apple doesn't
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.120]   want to be the biggest music streaming service.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.760]   Apple wants to make the most money off of a streaming music service.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.000]   That is a different goal.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Absolutely.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   And that's what they've done with phones, and that's what they've done with computers.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Right.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.160]   And if the record executives are lined up to talk to Jimmy I by, and at this party, it
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.320]   could be that Apple is offering them some kind of sweetener that makes it a better deal
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.800]   for them than whatever Spotify is.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.480]   I think the record industry is dead.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.400]   I think the artists are going to take control thanks to the internet.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.200]   And if you're a smart artist today, that's what you're doing.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.320]   I remember having this conversation with Paul Simon and he said, I don't, people of that
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.800]   generation are seeing their business model completely collapse.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.840]   And he said, I don't care for me, but Mike, I care for my kids, how are their musicians,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.240]   how are they going to make a living today?
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.840]   Same way they, they, most of their parents made music, touring, touring and t-shirts
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.640]   and merch on our record sales.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.960]   So, so from why is Beats going to, what is Beats going to have that's going to make a
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.960]   difference?
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.680]   Apparently they're going to have a bunch of exclusive deals with Taylor Swift.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.720]   They're going to, it's not in Taylor Swift's interest to do exclusive deals.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.360]   It's in the record labels interest because they're going to make more money, but the
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.760]   artists are not going to go for this.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.080]   It'll be a windowing thing where it'll appear for a month, you know, on Beats.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.040]   I don't know, I'm guessing, but I'm actually not a bad idea.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.040]   Well, that's all they'll ever get, right?
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.040]   Short term.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.800]   It's, you know, with the movie and TV industry right now, you get these, you know, it's the
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.480]   way a whole business works.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.480]   Right.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   All right.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.480]   Enough about Apple.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.480]   Sorry, Philip.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.480]   I'm, I'm okay.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.480]   Good seeing you.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.280]   Oh, come on.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.840]   I know you're into Pinterest.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.120]   Tell me about Pinterest.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.800]   I know nothing about Pinterest.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   You know nothing.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   I never paid.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.120]   We're all signed up for it.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120]   We're all boys.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.640]   I don't think we're, I have a Pinterest account.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.520]   I was, I will say that I gave up on Pinterest when you could basically no longer look at
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.800]   anything on anybody's Pinterest links without having a Pinterest account, which I have
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   no reason having.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   I'm on your side.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   That's why I didn't join.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   No, it's not.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.640]   I didn't join because it is what you're just showed me right there.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.440]   I'm going to my Pinterest.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.440]   Yes.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   You have to log in to see anything.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.200]   Well, what's wrong with that?
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.360]   Did I get a bite my friends?
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.640]   What if I just wanted to go look at somebody's Pinterest account?
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.880]   Now I can find other friends with these splash.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.840]   There's a lot of food on your Pinterest account, baby.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.360]   Yeah, you got a lot of food on there.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.840]   You could kind of tell what a person's interested in.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.880]   Food and a race card.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.720]   And an English estate and a sneaker.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   Who is it?
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   You're going to buy an English estate?
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.600]   Pinterest is kind of neat because it's like a magazine.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   And women's shoes.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   What is this?
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   Women's shoes.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.600]   I love women's shoes.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   My love women's shoes.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.200]   What about the, these, the fingernail polish?
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   What is that on there?
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.240]   Let's ask, we have a nice big studio audience, mostly male.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.800]   They're about two women in the whole group.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.320]   How many, how many use Pinterest here?
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.920]   And how many wear women's shoes?
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.040]   Okay, we got two people from Copenhagen, but they're actually Romanian.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.080]   One woman and a guy.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.080]   What do you do?
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.240]   No, actually like another woman's.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   A few guys.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   Well, but he's from Copenhagen.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   He's in camp.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   What?
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   That was charming.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.240]   Did you do an Instagram?
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   What did you do on an Instagram?
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:49.680]   Have my album covers because- You keep track of album covers.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.800]   They have my collection in Spotify, but I want to share them with friends.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.640]   So- Are you a graphic artist?
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.640]   No, he's a database engineer.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.640]   Huh?
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   A data miner.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.320]   Pretty clever, huh?
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:08.320]   I think Pinterest has a lot of appeal, but I think that it, for some reason, in this country
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.920]   anyway, men don't really think there's anything there for them.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.360]   And yet, I am complaining that Pinterest will not let me look at things on Pinterest without
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.360]   having an account.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.360]   What did you want to see?
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.960]   Did you want to see- I keep something on the links.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.680]   I love these romantic flats and black.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.440]   I admit, I've never looked for romantic flats.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.440]   I don't know.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.440]   Can you actually stand in those things?
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.320]   It looks like a rough go.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.880]   Actually pictures of musicians.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.880]   Furniture.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.320]   Furniture actually is what I've used it for when I was shopping to furnish my apartment.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.320]   Back to food again.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.800]   You must have moments where you're just food food food food.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.720]   And they say, you know, those shoes.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.720]   Oh.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.860]   And then you load up a shoe-
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.680]   Chicken cheddar and guacamole burgers.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.960]   Let's have those tonight.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   That looks totally disgusting.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.120]   How about cinnamon apple overnight oats?
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.120]   That doesn't look good either.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.920]   It'll be good for you.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.320]   They're vegan and gluten free, John.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.520]   And it's in a mason jar.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   It's in a mason jar.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.520]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   All right.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.480]   You want some cinnamon buns?
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.040]   I feel like Pinterest is like a beautiful magazine.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:15.000]   Anyway, I didn't know this, but apparently it's become a great place for people to make
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.760]   money as almost like as a business, like eBay as a business for people with two, in
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.560]   particular, two affiliate companies who have just been kicked off.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.640]   Just been kicked off.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.120]   And I have a feeling there's going to be a bit of an outcry.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.040]   In fact, I'm surprised there hasn't been a bit of an outcry.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.720]   Pinterest, which has been looking to monetize, is already considering if you and they claim
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.320]   this has nothing to do with monetization, but they are doing some interesting things
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.320]   to monetize.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.440]   One is they're going to do promoted pins, kind of like promoted tweets, but they but
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.160]   these two companies reward style and hello society.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:56.080]   All their links as of Friday or I'm sorry, Thursday are being pulled.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.120]   So if you were making affiliate money and pretty good affiliate money too, as people
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.560]   clicked on your links and buy, but the other thing Pinterest is going to do is maybe put
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.080]   a buy button there.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.840]   So an affiliate link is a bad thing, right?
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.360]   If they're going to start selling direct.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.920]   I think they should find some other way of doing this and let people do their own thing
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.360]   and make a little money and then they just skim off the top.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.640]   You want to be on Pinterest doing this?
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   We'll take 10%.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.640]   I think you're smart.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.240]   I think you're right because they could place to become a massive like commerce site and
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.000]   people would be making lots of money and Pinterest could just sit back and relax and
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   take a piece of it.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.120]   Pinterest doesn't have anything to do with it.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.640]   What is the business model now?
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.160]   Get as many.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   Get as many.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   That's a funny.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.960]   Get as many users as you can as fast as you can.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960]   Right?
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   That's an old one.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.720]   That's the traditional business model.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   I don't know.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.800]   I mean, you got to get some cash though.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.000]   No, I think if you click on something, can you buy or not?
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.120]   Sometimes you can and if you can, oftentimes like this beautiful DIY, no, that's a DIY,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.120]   so that's not.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.880]   But let's find something I can buy here.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.000]   How about that cake?
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.640]   An easy recipe.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.640]   That's DIY too.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.640]   See, I don't, that cake.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:10.280]   The apple apple just gives us things where now you can find apps through Pinterest.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.120]   Well, there's another monetization, right?
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.680]   How much food do you really want to get?
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.720]   This isn't my board.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   This is just generic Pinterest content.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.960]   Well, then whoever this up is really hungry.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   I don't think there's much on my board, frankly.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.960]   Well, let's see it.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.680]   Oh, you just want to know what I look cameras?
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.680]   Oh.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.120]   Audio gear, health, my favorite travel spots, travel gear.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.880]   Let's see your favorite travel spots.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.680]   All right, this is furnishing.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.440]   This is new for your, for your new, you don't even have an apartment.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.600]   I know.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   That's how long it's been.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   Here's my favorite travel spots.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.600]   Are you ready?
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   None.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.280]   You're just a homebody.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:48.760]   I set it up and I've got 3,790 followers and I've never done anything ever.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.760]   But did this sound?
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.000]   It's because you're too busy traveling to actually make plans and examples.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.360]   My favorite travel spots.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.840]   Should I just put a pin in somewhere?
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   Yeah, put it in something.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.680]   I'm going to Kiev.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.680]   Kiev.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.040]   Well, now that we actually pronounced the key.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   Really?
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.040]   Not Kiev?
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   No.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.040]   It's American school children pronunciation.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.040]   It's actually a key.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.040]   A key.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.040]   I'm going to Kiev because now that peace is broken out in the Ukraine, I think it's time
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.480]   for us all to go to Kiev.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.520]   Is this Kiev now?
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.640]   Here is independent square in Kiev.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.160]   Look how beautiful that is.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.560]   I'm going to pin that in my travel pins.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.720]   Let's put that in the travel pins.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:32.000]   Now the CIA and the NSA will be wondering why do you have this one thing on the financial
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   model.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.880]   Anyway, they don't have to pay for their data.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.160]   They send you a letter and you give them all the data.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:45.520]   A long off told story of companies building up a business and then pulling the rug out
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.240]   from under the people who have created that business in order to do their own monetization.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.840]   I was wondering, you know, eBay survived such things.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.240]   Twitter has survived such things.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.280]   I suppose Pinterest will.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.360]   It's still the best damn food magazine ever.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.360]   Look, cheers.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.360]   Chicken Kiev.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   Or do I pronounce that chicken?
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.040]   I think that would be pronounced chicken Kiev because that's the way everyone pronounces
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   it.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   Not chicken keve.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.040]   People would want to eat.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   But they wouldn't know what that is.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   That'd be disgusting.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   All right.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.240]   That's the more it looks.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   It's disgusting anyway, by the way, that dish.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.280]   You don't like anything I'm picking out here.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.920]   How about keve cake?
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.480]   What is it?
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   I don't know.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.960]   Oh, that looks different.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:32.160]   It's a Ukrainian classic cake that's light and flavor with a meringue hazelnut layer.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.160]   Mmm.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   Mmm.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.840]   It's a French cake, very similar.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   Mmm.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.840]   Delicious.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.840]   Delicious.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.320]   Here is the Metro in Kiev.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   It's a make.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   Kiv.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   I think that'd be cool to visit.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.040]   You know, the Russian Metro is pretty amazing, isn't it?
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.040]   I've been there.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.040]   Beautiful.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.040]   Kind of zarist Europe.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:37:08.580]   To think about the Russian
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:15.580]   Metro.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.660]   which ones are fast and slow and--
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.120]   - It's remarkable.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.700]   - You would think there'd be a standard escort.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.700]   - It's also steep and fast is really, uh.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.440]   - They're nuclear bunkers, they want to get you down in there.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.760]   That's probably what they are, they're shelters.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.340]   - And they got to get down fast apparently.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.160]   - They're shelters.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.540]   You're from Romania.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.100]   Similar things, do the escalators move
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.820]   pretty quick down there?
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.480]   (men laughing)
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.000]   I'm going to Budapest in the summer, the summer.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.840]   - Cool.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.340]   - Budapest or Budapest?
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.040]   - Budapest, I was told, is Pesht, right?
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.940]   Pesht.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.700]   - Is it Kiv or Kiev?
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.540]   - Yeah.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.860]   (men laughing)
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.780]   - He says you're wrong.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.620]   - No, no.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.820]   - Is that Victoria, Newell, and Pronounce is a Kiv.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.420]   All the diplomats that are had this just Norwegian--
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.260]   - Kiv.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.100]   - Type me is called Kiv.
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:02.940]   - Kiv.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.700]   - It's probably maybe pronounced Kiv someplace else.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.300]   But that's like they pronounced,
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.300]   they don't have London in France as a wanderer.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.140]   - Kiv.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.460]   Somebody says, okay, the escalators are fast.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.820]   Do you notice cars these days are going faster too?
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.140]   - No, no, okay, just checking.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.060]   They're going slower.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.820]   - They're going slower.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.140]   - People who've been in self-driving cars--
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:23.980]   - Yes.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.800]   - Say that it's like a normal car,
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.980]   except when they change lanes, they go, whoop.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.820]   - Right.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.140]   - That's if any human would ever change the lane.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.980]   - 'Cause they don't have to think,
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.820]   they know it's clear, and they say, just get over.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.540]   I think we need to fix that.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.380]   - So where I drive--
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.900]   - How could you never drive with my father?
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.940]   (men laughing)
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.500]   - Well, once you know it's clear,
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.700]   there's no point in going, let's nudge over,
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.780]   I tell I drive, 'cause I'm not sure it's clear.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.740]   Let me just nudge over, if nobody hunks,
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.220]   I go a little farther, no dogs.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.780]   - Can you bend your neck and you go like this
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.820]   and look behind?
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.100]   - When I was doing driver's training as a kid,
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.180]   I every time I turned my head, the car would go that way.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.020]   - A lot of people have that problem.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:58.980]   - I had to unlearn that.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.900]   - Yeah. - It's a bad habit.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.460]   Kiv, let's hear how it's pronounced.
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.300]   - Yes.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.660]   (snores)
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.500]   - Yeah, it's not--
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.340]   - That's an American pronunciation.
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.220]   - That's an American pronunciation, yes.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.060]   (laughs)
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.060]   - I get all my--
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.900]   - The first time I--
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.740]   - The first time you two--
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.220]   - The first time I heard the word pronounced Kiv,
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.660]   it was Victorian Newland, who was--
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.660]   - Who's Victorian Newland?
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.900]   - She's the Assistant Secretary of State to carry.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.380]   She was over there during the revolution.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.220]   - But she should know.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.220]   - And she said, Kiv, I said,
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.980]   "This is crazy, this woman can't pronounce this correctly."
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.660]   And then I looked into it and that's actually
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.740]   the official pronunciation.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.180]   - Apparently they would pronounce it.
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.220]   - The Russians pronounce it differently than Ukrainians.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.420]   So here we go, this is, you have audio from my computer
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.140]   'cause this is gonna end the debate.
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.380]   - Oh! - Go ahead!
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.140]   - Kia! - Kia, it's Russian language,
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.300]   Kia, it's Russian and kiaem!
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.120]   - Please. - Yeah!
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.480]   - Kiaem! - Kiaem!
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.960]   - Kiaem! - Kiaem!
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.940]   - Kiaem, it's Ukrainian! - Kiaem!
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.220]   - Yeah!!! - Yeah!
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.500]   - They're drunk. - Yeah!
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.360]   - That sounds like a society street and anything.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.200]   - Yeah, you win it, you...
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.980]   - That's right, Kiaem, Russian and Kiaem, Ukrainian!
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.320]   - She's not saying Kiaem, she's saying Kiaem!
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.260]   - So Kiaem! - She's like,
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.360]   "The vomiting sound is what those kids drink too much."
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.840]   - Where did you get that?
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.940]   - The internet is amazing, isn't it?
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.740]   - Yeah, you learn so much.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.580]   - Wow!
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.820]   - Turn us in any way you want.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.640]   - They're authoritative too.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.740]   - I think the Apple deal with Pinterest is interesting
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.460]   because that is a big problem, app discovery,
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.100]   and it's a problem for Apple, not just for developers
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.740]   because right now the only way to discover something,
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.140]   if somebody doesn't tell you about it,
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.980]   is via Apple and they're promoting it on iTunes.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.540]   - Or the top seller lists.
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.940]   - Yeah, which I don't think is really good for diversity.
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.900]   And I think it's in Apple's interest to promote diversity
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.900]   and to show there's more than just the stuff you know.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.400]   So Pinterest will start,
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.500]   it's called something called App Pins
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.100]   that will let you pin apps,
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.380]   and apparently Apple's gonna give them some money to do it.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.900]   - Yeah, you know I tried it today,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.020]   and I ran into the same problem as you have to have
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.180]   a membership to be doing any of this stuff.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.620]   - Join it, why do you guys don't want to join Pinterest?
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.460]   - That's right.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.340]   - 'Cause I'm sure I'm gonna get email from them.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.180]   They're gonna start--
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.020]   - And spam.
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.460]   - Spamming for me, yeah.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.340]   I don't need any more spam, I have too much spam now.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.460]   - I'm with him.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.580]   - Okay, that makes sense.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.140]   - And by the way, why do they have to put this barrier
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:31.300]   to entry, this is the violation of marketing 101.
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.820]   So I wanna go look at somebody's thinking,
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.300]   now I gotta sign up, I gotta put my email,
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.780]   I gotta do all, jump through hoops just to look at a pin.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.140]   - I'm gonna try to freeloaders like us.
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.860]   - So have-- - They're building a list.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.220]   - Okay. - Checking in twice.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.700]   - So let me search for, I don't know, a health,
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.420]   and see if I can find a health app,
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.100]   so I should see apps here as well as other things.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.980]   I see a lot of apps.
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.580]   - Yeah, a lot of apps, but no apps.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.740]   - No apps, but plenty of apps.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.180]   - Did you misspell it?
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.020]   (laughing)
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.900]   - This is the health page, you looked at me, health for a man.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.900]   - I just did health, I'm a man.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:09.980]   - Well, how would they know that?
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.660]   Oh, never mind, you saw everything.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.220]   - They know everything, yeah, I signed up.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.300]   - I get no sense. - How about if I searched
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.660]   for health and app?
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.340]   There you go, look at that,
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.460]   20 stunning mobile app designs featuring grabs and joints.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.300]   - Cool.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.260]   - There's an article, I just have to read.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.020]   - This will take your all data read this page.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.180]   - Okay, you're better off with the top 10 health apps.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.700]   - I think so, I really feel like this is something Apple
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.340]   should want to solve, which is that's just not enough
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:39.860]   diversity and if you want people to love their iPhones,
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.260]   what you want them to find is a great app
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:48.380]   that really fills their need.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.220]   And it might not be one of the--
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.900]   - You think it's easy for people to love their iPhones
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.980]   because everyone hates-- - Have you seen talking pets yet?
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.820]   - No.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.820]   - Okay, here we go.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.220]   (laughing)
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.820]   - Is this the show?
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.100]   Do you think-- (laughing)
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.100]   Do you think--
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.100]   (laughing)
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.140]   - Okay, I want to see this.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:12.140]   - Okay, so I sent like a valentine to my daughter.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.340]   Right, that's the Aussie the dog.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.180]   - That's the dog, yeah.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.180]   - Yeah, and I sent her this valentine from Talking Pet.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.460]   You ready?
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.540]   - Can't see it.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.300]   - This is our red.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.100]   Violets are blue.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.900]   - That's my dog, Talking.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.900]   - I weren't a dog.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.380]   I could rhyme this for you.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.220]   Happy valentine's day.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.460]   - It doesn't sound like a dog.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.260]   - It could sound, well, I could do other ones too.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.100]   You want to see--
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.820]   - You want a dog sounding like a dog.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.620]   - You can make it sound like anything you want.
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.660]   - I want something that sounds like it.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.580]   This sounds like a computerized phony dog.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.900]   I want a little dog sound.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.740]   - See if I can find some more.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.380]   I've been sending a lot of these lately.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.460]   - Yes, apparently.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:53.300]   - You can do this.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.460]   - You can do deep voices, you can do--
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.500]   - I like Raoul.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.340]   - Let me see.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.220]   Here, how about, okay, you want a deep voice?
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.220]   Here's one.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.220]   I sent this one here.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.540]   - I really like this.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:06.660]   - This is a gorilla.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.780]   You sent somebody a gorilla, Talking Gorilla.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.140]   - I really like this.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.580]   (screaming)
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.740]   - Okay, okay, Talking Pets.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.060]   It doesn't have to just be a pet.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:17.900]   - Yeah, it could be a bug.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.900]   - It could be a spider.
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.900]   - You'll forget I'm a boy.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.700]   - Yeah, that makes more sense that one.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.780]   - That's a good one, Talking Spider.
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.860]   - Yeah, here's another one of Aussie.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.700]   This is my dog.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.860]   - Hey, what you doing?
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:32.700]   What you doing?
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.020]   - That sounds a little more like the dog.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.700]   - What you doing?
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.380]   Hey, hey, what you doing?
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.780]   (laughing)
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.260]   Where's Charlie?
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.900]   What you doing?
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:43.740]   - That's pretty much--
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.580]   - My dog says--
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.260]   - How much time do you spend on this?
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.780]   (laughing)
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:49.820]   - I think my dog says, you're gonna eat that?
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.660]   - Yeah.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.500]   - You're gonna eat that?
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.340]   - Oh, I can do that.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.180]   You're gonna eat that?
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.020]   What you doing?
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.860]   You're gonna eat that?
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.180]   How much all that ever goes through my dog's head?
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.020]   - What you doing?
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.300]   - That's pretty much what any dog--
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.580]   - I'm just gonna say dog, a dog, period.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.860]   - Hey, what you doing?
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:04.700]   (laughing)
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.940]   - I love it!
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.660]   All right, we're gonna take a break.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.920]   (laughing)
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.420]   I'm a simple man with simple needs.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:17.020]   - Yeah, that would make sense.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.180]   - And I think if I had a Pinterest account,
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.660]   I'd probably pin that to my Pinterest account.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.860]   - You do, I do.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.700]   - And I will.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.700]   - Since I get home to my pin that.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.580]   - Our show today brought to you by Linda.com.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.380]   I would recommend it to anybody who's looking for
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:34.020]   a great place to go to learn new skills,
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.340]   whether it's tech or business skills,
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.300]   like negotiation, resume building,
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.740]   Linda, L-Y-N-D-A.com.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.740]   Actually, no Linda Wyman, since, in fact,
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.940]   if Patrick hadn't run off, he could tell you.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.260]   We used to have her on the screen savers all the time.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.700]   Web design was her thing, but she's expanded,
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.260]   and Linda that come to cover everything, photography.
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.180]   They have Bill Burtman-Royce,
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.940]   Photoshop classes, they're the best in the world.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.820]   Visual design, software training like Excel
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.540]   and WordPress, Photoshop, yeah.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.460]   And the thing is, these are all taught by experts
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.860]   who are great teachers, they're produced professionally,
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.420]   they have transcripts, they divide it up into sections,
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.020]   so it's very easy to jump to the one thing you wanna learn
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.700]   or watch the whole thing and become an expert.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.820]   Here's some of the new courses
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.380]   that I've just been playing with, improving your memory.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.020]   I forgot who does that one.
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.060]   SEO Fundamentals and of course,
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:31.140]   Sperts Pixel Playground Series, which is incredible.

[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.300]   like accounting and marketing and management.

[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.260]   who is a designer at Tom for a long time.
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.180]   Did a course, she's making a lot of money on it,
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.660]   and now I get to look at it.

[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.780]   and I think you're gonna really like it, yeah.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:44.620]   They need, I don't know,
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.460]   they have any drone courses yet.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.820]   I haven't found any yet.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:48.820]   I need to learn.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:50.900]   I want a drone.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.940]   I only know one drone command, up.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.860]   And that was it, that's all she wrote.
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.500]   Hey, if you missed anything this week,
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.060]   you missed a great week on Twit.
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.740]   We have a few of the highlights,
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.660]   and something Don Seagull or I like to call,
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.660]   I have said right here.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.700]   Previously on Twit.
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.860]   Here comes Brian Burnett on the EcoRica!
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.820]   (gun shots)
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:12.940]   Before you buy.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.900]   From Amazon, this is the Echo.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.740]   This is the future.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.940]   The all homes are gonna have speakers and microphones,
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.580]   personal assistants on the other end of it.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.940]   Alexa, Wikipedia, Leo Laport.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:22.860]   Leo Gordon-Loth,
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.140]   Port is an American technology broadcaster.
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.140]   (rooster crows)
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.260]   Security now.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:31.060]   An update on the Anthem breach, names,
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:34.660]   Social Security numbers, and residential addresses.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.700]   You had no recourse if you want healthcare.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.340]   You're gonna give your social security number
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:41.660]   to people who do a crap job of protecting.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.100]   Tech news tonight.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:46.260]   Happy early Valentine's Day, Apple Car enthusiasts.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.780]   Amid a few weeks of rumors that Apple
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.140]   is getting into the car business,
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.980]   the Wall Street Journal just added electric fuel to that fire
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.860]   by reporting Apple has several hundred employees
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.500]   working secretly towards creating
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.060]   an Apple branded electric vehicle.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.260]   This week in Google.
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:03.900]   Google has added a virtual genius bar.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:04.740]   How you doing?
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.580]   Love your set.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.900]   You know, we are on very Googly here at Google.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.580]   Calling Google support on this show never gets old.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.420]   Twit.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:13.740]   Twit with your head, not over it.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.380]   I think you'd be the hurt yourself.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.900]   That's why next week, Brian Burnett will be reviewing
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.420]   powered roller skates.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.260]   He will.
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:21.100]   He will.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.580]   He actually is going to.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.980]   Brian Burnett, one of our employees.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.100]   Do you think there's liability if you have an employee
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.060]   do something and he really hurts himself badly?
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:30.900]   Yes.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.740]   Big time.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.740]   He was doing it in part of his duties on the show.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.180]   It's called Taking All Your Money.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.020]   Oh Lord.
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:42.420]   These are those things you probably tried them at CES.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:43.260]   I'm sure you saw them.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.220]   Are they independently powered roller skates?
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.060]   No.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.380]   They don't put independently powered things on either foot.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:50.220]   Say they call them smart.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.060]   Yeah.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.660]   And nobody's going to hurt themselves.
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.140]   You're saying Curry likes that echo?
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.220]   He has one and he thinks is the best thing ever.
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:57.900]   I'm amazed.
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.700]   He's just being worried that like he's being spied on him.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.620]   He says he is.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.980]   Oh, so he doesn't care.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.420]   Yeah, he's being spied on by the echo.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.900]   He's listening to everything you say.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.340]   He says this instant.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.220]   He says you say whatever the thing is.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:11.980]   And it's got a real voice, a nice voice, not like Siri.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.140]   What do you do with it?
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.060]   You say things like what temperature is it
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.500]   or how many cups in a quarter?
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.500]   He says I'll play the latest no agenda show and it played it.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.220]   And well, you can do that with pie.
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.180]   It's actually the greatest podcast thing ever.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.180]   We did it.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.500]   Listen to TNT on-- I think you say listen to TNT on TuneIn
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.740]   because it has a TuneIn connection.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:32.820]   So anything on TuneIn internet radio, it'll play.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.420]   Or you could say listen to the Giants game.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.780]   He says you don't even have to say the TuneIn party.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:38.300]   It does it.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.060]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.940]   Until you try it, it's kind of like what?
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:42.620]   I don't know.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:43.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.340]   But once you get used to it, you kind of feel like,
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.420]   I want one in every room.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:50.220]   I want my house to be listening to me.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.220]   And just do what I've--
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.420]   I'm going to go to your house listening.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.380]   You want your house to be responsive to your every win.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.820]   Yes.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.460]   Listening part--
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.180]   If had robotic arms, I'd go for it.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:58.660]   Otherwise--
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.260]   It could.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:50:59.860]   I don't care.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.100]   They can't kill you in your sleep.
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.020]   You don't want it in your house.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.260]   I get to know what it's like by looking outside.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.300]   No, no.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.620]   Well, yeah, sure.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.500]   But weather apps are like the number one category.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.740]   Yeah, people go, oh, yeah, it's sunny.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:13.940]   Everybody has a weather app.
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:14.260]   OK.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.340]   Have a look at your weather app.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:15.860]   No, I do.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.220]   I have my phone.
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.220]   The only thing I leave notifications is our indoors.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.180]   And my phone boots tells me the weather.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:21.620]   Why should I--
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.180]   Right.
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:23.380]   That's why you don't have to look at the one.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.100]   So you've got the weather right in the front screen there.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.500]   That's good.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:26.780]   You know what?
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.700]   72 degrees right now in sunny--
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.460]   You're going to be in a big giant haunted house
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.740]   when you're older and you're going to be like, hold up.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.300]   And the kids are going to walk by saying, yeah,
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.780]   that's where that crazy guy lives.
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.580]   Where did I see that editorial?
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:40.140]   Exact editorial, was it a giga home?
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:40.540]   It was.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.940]   It was Janko Wreckers on giga home saying, you know,
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:50.580]   Silicon Valley really has a duty to stop creating stuff
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.860]   that isolates us from other people.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.300]   And pretty much everything--
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.300]   I thought this was really interesting.
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.940]   It's a column called Disrupting Reality.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.820]   Silicon Valley is ignoring busy, ignoring the real world.
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.460]   Don't feel like talking to anyone ever again.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:05.020]   Don't worry.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.380]   There's an app for that.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.420]   The MyTime app on Android just launched
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.300]   will let you make appointments with local businesses
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.860]   without talking to anybody.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:19.420]   Uber, you get a cab without talking to anybody.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.260]   It just comes.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:25.380]   In fact, Uber driver is even incented to be nice to you
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.300]   because otherwise it gets bad ratings.
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:31.260]   So even though he's probably miserable, depressed, oppressed,
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.700]   making no money, he's going to be cheerful
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.980]   because he wants a good rating, right?
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:37.620]   Actually, this is the same goes for riders.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.020]   You have to be nice to the driver.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.300]   He could rate you badly.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.420]   Task rabbit, never stand in line again.
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.460]   Birchbox, Amazon Prime, never have
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:48.300]   to go to a store to buy anything.
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:51.060]   Even homeschooling, which is the latest, according to Wired,
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.700]   the latest Silicon Valley fat, is all about getting your kids
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.220]   away from other people.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.740]   That's the problem.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.900]   Now that's not true as a homeschooler.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.260]   As a homeschooler.
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.940]   You're both homeschoolers?
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:03.420]   Yeah, I was in my case.
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.900]   No, that's not true because homeschoolers and Patrick
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:09.020]   will say yes when I say this.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.060]   They have plenty of programs for the kids
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.700]   to meet up with other kids and go to on field trips.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.180]   But it's not the same as sitting a sweaty--
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.140]   Sweaty room with--
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:18.580]   --saying nothing is--
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.140]   --bassiling--
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.380]   Being oppressed by the teacher.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.740]   You're a good news school.
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.700]   --getting measles.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.780]   No, homeschooling is the way to go.
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.540]   I also would like to point out that all of my children
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.180]   are vaccinated completely.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.900]   The collapse of the American--
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.700]   I think Janko's actually kind of interesting when he says this.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.300]   He says, I remember listening to Meetup founder Scott
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.780]   Hefferman in 2005.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.140]   He said, the thing that inspired him to launch Meetup
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.420]   was a book called Bowling Alone, which
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.020]   talks about the collapse of American community.
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.140]   He said, I want to create a startup that's
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.660]   about bringing people together.
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.140]   And remember, there were a lot of those.
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:55.940]   Meetups.
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:56.780]   Whatever happened to those.
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:57.460]   Have a tweet up.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:58.860]   Who wants to meet people?
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:53:59.780]   I don't want to meet people.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.300]   I don't like people.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:01.780]   Everyone else.
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:02.780]   Everyone else.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.020]   Out.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.780]   No.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.540]   But I think that he makes an interesting point.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:12.860]   Don't you think that a lot of what we could see as technological
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.220]   improvements and advances really are mostly about just not
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.460]   a habit of talking to anybody?
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:16.980]   No.
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:17.340]   They're about--
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.180]   Self-driving car.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.820]   I just want to--
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:22.140]   If you're driving the car, the car drives itself,
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:22.860]   what difference does it make?
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:23.580]   It's still one person.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.660]   I don't have to talk to cops.
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.020]   How often you get pulled over?
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:28.540]   Lots.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.820]   That's my social life.
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:31.140]   What do you think, Philip?
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.540]   You think that he's off base, or I think there's something to it?
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.380]   No, I think--
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.540]   It's really the computer.
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.500]   We spend so much time looking at the screen.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.940]   And that's-- so people are going to make money,
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.780]   trying to get you to look at the screen more.
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:46.860]   I don't know.
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:50.220]   Riding the subway in New York now, everybody's got their iPhone
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.740]   or their pad out.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.060]   And it is different.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:55.220]   You know, I don't--
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.620]   Well, that's what Uber's all about.
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:58.220]   So you don't have to go be around people.
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.220]   You can avoid mass transit.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:00.700]   No, it's not.
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:01.220]   I think--
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.460]   I think you have to deal with the driver one way or the other.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.540]   But there's one guy instead of like a bunch of people
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.460]   on a bus vomiting.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:08.460]   Well, I don't think people--
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.500]   That's not a bus.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.100]   Most of the people who are taking Uber's--
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.220]   I don't-- I were driving, I think, previously,
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.060]   are taking cabs.
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.020]   Uber exists because it was getting impossible to get
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.460]   a cab in San Francisco.
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:19.860]   His cab service in San Francisco--
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:20.220]   That's true.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.580]   --and the Muni in San Francisco is a hot mess.
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.580]   It shouldn't take 90 minutes to 120 minutes
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:28.100]   to travel seven miles across San Francisco.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.900]   Look at-- this is Steve Jobs-- Steve Jobs.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:30.620]   Steve Wozniem.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:32.500]   Being interested in an interview with Steve Jobs.
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.740]   But Steve Wozniem.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:37.460]   He did a-- recently did an interview on the BBC.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.700]   And I thought his take on this and everybody staring
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:42.380]   into their phones all the time was kind of interesting.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.340]   It was whoops.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.660]   I just pressed the wrong button.
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.620]   Let's press play.
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.540]   So the phone-- addiction to anything probably
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:51.300]   has some dangers in terms of what was before.
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.540]   But then once you get very used to it,
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:56.740]   if you're in a society that's accustomed to a lot of people
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:59.380]   being addicted to cigarettes or alcohol or something like that,
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.460]   it just sort of becomes just one of the natural things.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.900]   You don't really-- it's hard to measure how dangerous it is.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.380]   It's more dangerous to a prior lifestyle.
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.180]   So that's what I'm thinking is interesting.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.940]   He's saying, we talk a lot about people
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.260]   being addicted to their smartphones.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.300]   It's not bad.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:17.180]   It's just from the perspective of the prior lifestyle.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.900]   Well, interest me, there's a theory about Silicon Valley
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:25.020]   that it's attracted a lot of autistic people who've then
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.060]   made it with autistic people and created
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.940]   a generation of autistic people.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.700]   And that's part of the reason why it's so antisocial.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.140]   What do you think about that?
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.300]   Why?
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.260]   No agenda material.
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.780]   There's no question that many of the people in the valley
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.340]   are on the spectrum.
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.020]   They're not autistic necessarily, but they're on the spectrum.
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:45.980]   They're anti-social.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.900]   Bill Gates, we always wondered about him and his rogers.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:49.420]   His ass beers.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.140]   And he's the last burgers, right?
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:52.140]   Little.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:53.980]   OK.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:58.780]   And it makes sense that if you have trouble with people
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:02.100]   and reading social cues, that you would be attracted to machines.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.140]   Well, I know I am.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.060]   If you give the machine the right instructions,
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.660]   the machine does what you tell it to.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.300]   People are not that simple.
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.340]   No, I agree.
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.060]   This is painting with a very broad brush.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:12.380]   Yes.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:13.380]   But if that makes sense--
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:14.300]   You're the most social person sitting here,
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.780]   because you're constantly talking to the masses.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.820]   But isn't that interesting?
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.060]   That's a common misconception.
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:23.980]   Remember Johnny Carson?
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.220]   Johnny Carson, yes.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.220]   But here's my argument.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.220]   He totally introverted.
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.940]   My kind of argument to that was he got it out of his system,
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:33.020]   because he was doing an hour and a half initially, at least.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.540]   He used to go to parties and sit in a corner,
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:35.900]   because he could not talk to people.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:36.540]   Yeah, I--
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.020]   And I think a lot of people in broadcasting
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:42.780]   are introverts, because this is a managed interaction.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:43.940]   I'm not actually talking to anybody.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:44.780]   Leo, I've seen you--
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:45.300]   Let's jump in.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:46.700]   I've seen you at parties, Leo.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.860]   You're no introvert.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:50.020]   I know introverts.
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.340]   And you're no introvert.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.580]   Miami cops falsely reporting their location on ways.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:58.220]   We talked about this a couple of weeks ago that some police say
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.860]   that waves ability to report--
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:03.180]   that's the navigating program of Google owns and--
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:03.980]   Those are the cops.
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:04.820]   --he's going to the reports.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.060]   Where there's a police officer up front
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.820]   to avoid speed traps, things like that.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.780]   Police don't like it.
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.060]   They say that just encourages people.
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.060]   Encourages why.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:11.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.140]   Well, not-- anyway, Miami cops are saying--
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.380]   I'm over here.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.940]   And they think this will make ticketing easier
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:22.460]   and prevent quite legitimately cops stalking.
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:26.060]   That story pointed out that if the cops say, I'm here,
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.740]   I'm here, I'm here, and they're not really there,
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:32.380]   it has the same effect of putting a fake cop car
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.660]   on the side of the highway--
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:34.460]   Which they sometimes do.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:35.340]   --because people will slow down.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:40.060]   So it actually probably reduces speeding.
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:40.820]   That was way--
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.660]   --of defense, by the way, of that there's police ahead.
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.860]   They said that most users tend to drive more carefully
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:47.740]   when they think law enforcement is nearby.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:49.660]   I know I slow down when I see--
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.900]   you know, on the ways it says--
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.780]   Sure, because you don't want another ticket.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.280]   Right.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.180]   I mean, that's supposed to be the purpose of speed limits
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.660]   and cops enforcing those to have people drive safe.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.740]   Much more effective to have a lot of presence than--
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.220]   I mean, even better than ticketing is just--
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.140]   So it's false flag.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:07.900]   Cool.
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:08.420]   What do you think?
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:09.660]   It's not a false flag.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.260]   But what is a false flag?
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:14.020]   False flag is where the government sets up
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:17.940]   some sort of an event that they actually invented.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.260]   Like, wag the dog.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:20.780]   Wag the dog is a good example.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:21.420]   Watch that movie.
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:22.100]   It's outstanding.
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.820]   Great movie.
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:23.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:27.140]   So the idea is in order to distract you from what's really
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:27.140]   going on.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:32.340]   The classic false flag was the burned down of the Reichstag
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.220]   in--
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:33.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.060]   Or the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.380]   That's a perfect example.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:36.780]   That was--
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:37.860]   --gave us an excuse to enter the deal--
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.740]   It took us 20 years to find out that that was all bull crap.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.820]   But yeah, the Gulf of Tonkin is one of our more recent--
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.260]   The Reichstag fire for--
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.900]   A lot of people think that they remember the main explosion.
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.820]   The Lusitania, they believe, was one.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.580]   There's a lot of them.
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.780]   You have a spider right over your--
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.620]   Oh my god, that's great.
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.060]   Look at that.
[00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.860]   Oh, see, he's crawling up as quickly as he can.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:00.620]   Yeah, that was a mistake.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.340]   He thinks safety is up above.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.540]   Yeah, he's going to bite you.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.020]   Ah!
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.620]   That's not a brown recluse, is it?
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.180]   No.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.820]   Dang.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.900]   He's on your leg.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.380]   It's good.
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:15.220]   Spiders are good, right?
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:15.940]   Spiders kill in.
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:17.660]   So I'm wearing an Android Wear watch.
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.300]   I have to admit that I broke out the iPhone the other day
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.500]   thinking I better start getting ready because the Apple
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.380]   watches would be out in April.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.500]   I actually like the Android Wear watch.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.780]   I'm wearing a Moto 360, which apparently is the best
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:29.140]   selling number.
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.420]   How many of these watches do you have?
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.260]   I have them all.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.940]   OK.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.180]   Every watch.
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.340]   Do they send them to you?
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.940]   No, no, I don't do that, Philip.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.660]   I'm very careful to not be--
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.820]   mostly because companies hate me--
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.420]   to not be on the gravy train.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.820]   I buy everything because I want to be objective about it.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.540]   We do get a few things for about before you buy we get sent.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:49.940]   But this is--
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.060]   You buy everything because you want everything.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:52.620]   I want it.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.660]   And most--
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.140]   These guys don't send us kind of stuff out free.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:56.660]   There's no another--
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.700]   They used to, didn't they?
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:58.220]   Well, the difference--
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:58.860]   What happened?
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.580]   Margins.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.780]   I've talked to people.
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.100]   In fact, I talked to Intel about this
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.380]   because I wanted to get one of those little--
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.180]   I remember going to your house I've told this to her before.
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.780]   And you had a laptop on every stack of your staircase.
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.420]   Yeah, I was right.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.620]   Those days are over.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.700]   What happens once the margins got small, essentially,
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:15.140]   if they give you a free product, they've
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.940]   lost one month's worth of profits.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:17.460]   Wow.
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.020]   And so they can't do that anymore.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:19.540]   So you don't--
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.860]   They still send out products--
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.580]   They want it back.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.060]   Right?
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:22.580]   They want it back.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.220]   Sometimes, sometimes not.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.540]   It's a pain in the ass to send it back
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.620]   because it screws them up as much as it screws up.
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.540]   What are they going to do with a used beat up old laptop?
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.380]   Send it to the next person on the line for--
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.740]   But it's not like it used to be.
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.900]   You have to agree.
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:34.900]   Yes, I agree with that.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.860]   But they still send--
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.340]   Do you get product placement money?
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.060]   I wish I did.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.580]   We've been trying.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.180]   Patrick's drinking Coca-Cola for free.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.420]   Yeah, there's no profit in that.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.340]   American Idol or anything.
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:46.820]   We tried.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.460]   I thought, when we first started the network,
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.300]   I thought, we should be able to get Domino's pizza.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.780]   Didn't we do that on the radio show?
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:54.260]   We used to have Max's diner.
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.620]   Yeah, they would send us free food.
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.340]   Well, we didn't get any money, but we least get free food.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.420]   Lots of it.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.580]   It was really greasy.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.260]   It was incredibly greasy.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.060]   It was good, though.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:02.620]   But it was--
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.140]   I think that's when my weight problem began.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.700]   Something--
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:07.540]   You know what's really good?
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.220]   They had the little mini-roobin sandwiches.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.060]   There's like--
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.180]   I don't remember a lot of this.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.140]   Like a ladder full of--
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.020]   Like hundreds of them.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.460]   Yeah, there's all leftovers, I think, or some banquet.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.460]   They picked them up.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.580]   Give them to those idiots over at the radio station.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.140]   Apparently, according to Robert Morrison and our chatroom,
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.140]   it's the same with rifle reviews.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.500]   You don't get rifles free anymore?
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.940]   The free rifle business is really--
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.380]   No, it's actually--
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.100]   You know how you read the reviews of the Apple products,
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.540]   and there's the same four reviewers
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.980]   that write the same glowing review of the same four products?
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.460]   That's the way rifle reviews are.
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:40.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.220]   It's the most amazing--
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.220]   It's actually--
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.420]   Read rifle reviews?
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:44.220]   Yeah, I do.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:44.820]   I can imagine.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.380]   What should I get?
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:46.820]   We'll talk.
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:49.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.220]   We'll start you now.
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.660]   I want that gun that Currie has.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.060]   It's a shotgun and a pistol.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:53.580]   No, you don't.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.660]   That thing's crazy.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.420]   No.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:55.920]   No.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.420]   No.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.340]   Has he ever fired that?
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.060]   I'm sure he has.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.060]   It must send your arm like that.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.660]   Not necessarily.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.300]   First, you learned how to hold the gun.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.300]   Yes, that helps a lot.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:04.660]   Very first thing.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.140]   Anyway, we were talking about--
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.060]   We'll start you out with a nice BB gun, a red rider.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.140]   In 2014, I want a red rider.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:12.500]   You should.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.260]   They still make him.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.860]   You'll poke your eye out.
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.180]   They're awesome.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:20.540]   In 2014, 4.6 smart bands of any kind--
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.940]   4.6 million.
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.060]   That's a big difference.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.980]   4.6 million smart bands of any kind were sold.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.260]   Of those, fewer than a million were Android Wear devices.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:32.420]   Only 720,000 Android Wear devices.
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.860]   Shifts last your thing.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.980]   Well, the Android Wear is considerably more expensive
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.700]   than something like a Fitbit.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.500]   That's true.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.100]   It's also funny.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.820]   There's a great article in the BBC
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:43.660]   where they talked about how they looked at the Vivo
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:47.340]   Smart, the Fitbit Charts, the Misfit Shine, the Jawbone up.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:51.540]   And they had a 23% difference in the amount of distance
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.780]   they covered and like 2,700 calories difference
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.340]   in terms of a week of what they estimated the calories.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.060]   Molly Wood just did a whole big piece in the New York Times
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:03.380]   on that.
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.580]   What is the most accurate?
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.300]   I don't know.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.100]   Does it matter that much?
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.300]   It'd be 20%.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.340]   I guess that's one of the best steps.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.780]   That's a fair amount.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:16.100]   And 2,700 calories is a pretty huge amount of calories.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.220]   That's a lot of calories.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.140]   So the me band, just as an example,
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.460]   show me sold.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.180]   The me band was basically like a Fitbit or whatever.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.220]   Presumably, I guess sold only in Asia,
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.540]   or maybe just in China.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.140]   One day, 103,000 units.
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:33.740]   So I mean, 720,000 for a whole year
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.260]   is not a lot of smart watches.
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.980]   I don't know what to include from that.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:39.780]   I actually liked the Moto 360 and find it reduced.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.340]   Well, they basically came out in the fourth quarter.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.460]   The best selling one was the Moto 360,
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:45.900]   because I think it was because it was first.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:46.780]   It was fairly featured.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.820]   It was round.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:48.540]   It wasn't first.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.620]   Actually, there were the square ones came out first,
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.460]   and the Moto was a few months later.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.060]   I like it.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.140]   You could change the face, and it tells you
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.500]   when the phone's ringing, who's calling.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.300]   You can talk to it.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.060]   Can you turn it to Russian?
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:00.540]   No, I'm not going to.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.260]   You can actually.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:01.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:02.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.020]   That'd be cool.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.380]   I'm not going to do it around.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:07.060]   No, no, no.
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.220]   Don't tell me how I don't want to know.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.740]   OK, go ahead, Defell.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:14.260]   I tried to figure out how many watches Apple was going to sell.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.780]   I tried to get the analysts away.
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:18.260]   And I can't remember what the numbers were, but they started
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:21.220]   about 7 to 10 million, and then some people
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.140]   were talking about 20 or 30 million.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:28.980]   So, you know, we're talking about a different scale coming in 2015.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.500]   It's also hard to say how much, because we don't know how much it's
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.100]   going to cost.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.460]   We know the lowest end will be 350.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:40.060]   And they're going to sell probably 70% of the sales will be in that model.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:43.340]   OK, so it doesn't matter how much the stainless steel or gold one
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.900]   costs, because that's going to be the fraction of the total sales.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:47.500]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.100]   Small for both.
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.140]   They'll make a lot of money on those, the margin on those.
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:55.380]   This report, which comes from Canales, which is an analyst group,
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.020]   says that Samsung still dominates.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:02.900]   They launched six devices in 14 months, but they sold the most.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.260]   I've tried all the Samsung devices and were underwhelmed.
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.100]   I'm like Android Wear.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.660]   Samsung does make an Android Wear.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.860]   I like Android Wear, although they're all the same.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.740]   I mean, you can read that.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.380]   It's what you just said.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:15.780]   Says three days ago, Samsung launched just six devices.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.060]   And what did-- how did you do that?
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:18.980]   Pretty fancy, huh?
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:19.940]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:20.900]   Did you do a search?
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.260]   No, I just recorded you.
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.860]   Oh.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.340]   And then found the story.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.300]   And then a search for the story.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.220]   It does everything.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:29.900]   It's amazing.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.940]   So what you're saying, I think, Philip,
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.860]   is that the sales of Android Wear
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:40.780]   are not an indicator of how well the Apple Watch will do.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.260]   Right.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.140]   I think-- I mean, I don't know.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:47.020]   It feels like a lot of product got put out
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:50.420]   in advance of the product that's probably going to set with the category.
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.940]   I would agree with you, especially with that Samsung stuff.
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:56.340]   But this Moto 360, for instance, is pretty mature.
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.620]   In other words, these Android Wear watches
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.100]   are not the first smart watches.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.180]   And I think they learned a lot from the first ones.
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.140]   Frankly, I think the utility is high on this.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.900]   So it tells time.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.740]   You get notifications.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:07.220]   Tells times.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.020]   What else do you do with it?
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.500]   Get notifications, accounts, steps.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.460]   This will give you a heart rate.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.060]   Not all Android Wear watches do that.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.100]   You can dictate to it.
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.580]   So if I get a text message, I can quickly
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.140]   dedicate a response by just tapping it and saying, yeah,
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.060]   and tell her I'll be right there.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.620]   I think those things are all fairly useful.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.460]   I don't have a big problem taking a phone out of my pocket.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.700]   So I think these are still a luxury device.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.740]   I think nobody's going to say, I have to have a smart one.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.180]   Can we make some predictions about what, especially
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.820]   what Philip thinks about the Apple watch is going to do well?
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.420]   Yeah, I'm curious.
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.460]   Yeah, it's not going to be like the phone.
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.140]   I mean, you can sort of see that everybody in the world
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:46.460]   is eventually going to need a smartphone, or pretty much
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:46.660]   everybody.
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.660]   I would agree on that.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:50.300]   That's the computing platform for the next 10 years.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.420]   Right.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:55.900]   I had-- the tablets, clearly, it was a smaller thing.
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.980]   It was a smaller market.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:03.980]   It's-- I can't imagine the whole world needing a smart watch.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:04.620]   It doesn't--
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.660]   It's a luxury item.
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:06.580]   It's not jewelry.
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:07.580]   I mean, this is why--
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.580]   It's not jewelry-- not jewelry scale luxury.
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.740]   Well, I mean, but they also just--
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.020]   one, they're talking about putting in a jewelry type display
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.620]   to sell these in the Apple stores.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:14.980]   And two.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:15.340]   Safe.
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:16.580]   And safe.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.260]   Angela Arrence is who they just hired from Burberry.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.140]   That's a fashion.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.740]   That's a pretty huge--
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:22.820]   But that's fashion.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.660]   Yeah, I forgot about that.
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.940]   I mean, yeah, they're paying her a ton of money.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:30.060]   In fact, she got more-- she made more money than Tim Cook
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:30.780]   last year.
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:31.700]   Right.
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.900]   In order to lure her away from Burberry.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.660]   Well, they had to make good on her Burberry bonus
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:38.380]   that she was going to get.
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:42.740]   She had to give up a bonus to go to Apple.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.500]   I think the watch does several things.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.180]   One, it shows that Apple can still make product
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:51.460]   and make new categories.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.740]   And I think they can see that the margin is good enough
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:58.500]   for them that they will make a lot of money on these,
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.900]   especially if the Chinese who like to show off their wealth
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.980]   by the gold ones, good God.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:04.820]   That's a good point.
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.740]   That made the minas sell a lot of those,
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.620]   but the margins got to be pretty good.
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.500]   So I mean, I'm going to buy one.
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:11.940]   I am.
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:12.420]   I will too.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.500]   I have to get one, Leo.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.060]   I have to get one, yeah.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.500]   And I'm looking for two.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.340]   Oh, come on.
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.180]   John, are you going to get one?
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:19.940]   I'm not getting one.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.580]   He's going to take my cast off.
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.580]   I just get the second hand step from him.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.900]   It's fine, works fine for me.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.620]   I don't think you have to be in that minute.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.460]   I do.
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:29.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:30.860]   And I'm wondering because there's
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:32.060]   some things that are unique to it.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.740]   Like you can't-- you will be able to--
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.500]   on the Apple Watch, for instance, if you're--
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.500]   but-- and this is going to help sell them.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.700]   If you wear one too, Patrick, I can do little messages
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.100]   to you on the face of the watch.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.220]   That would be great in school.
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.380]   Like, drop picture.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.420]   Nick Bilton was telling us that he-- one of his friends,
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:50.780]   he says, who has an Apple Watch, who works at Apple,
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.940]   and everybody else does.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:53.460]   He just-- when he wants to go to lunch,
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.460]   he just sends a message.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.340]   He just draws an L on his watch.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.260]   And his friend knows that he wants to go to lunch.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.940]   It's even better than Snapchat.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.340]   And then there's the taptic interface.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.220]   Did you hear that story that Tim Cook told that apparently
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.700]   there's this thing that after 15 minutes, if you haven't,
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.340]   stood up.
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.620]   Yeah, it reminds you to stand up.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:16.700]   So 15 minutes into an Apple meeting, everybody stands up.
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:18.020]   Now, they'll probably make it out of sync.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.540]   So it more looks more like a kalaya
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.780]   people who are different people standing up at different times.
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.660]   That would be better, wouldn't it?
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:26.420]   Especially if it made a squeak like that chair.
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:31.140]   That's a squeak.
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.780]   This chair is really gun squeaky.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.980]   Just a word to anybody who wants to be an evil villain.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.580]   If you're going to get a chair like this,
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:38.740]   you want to keep it lubricated.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:39.820]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:42.420]   Because it's really-- when you're asking for $1 million
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:46.340]   in your chair is squeaking, it just takes all the fun out of it.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.700]   Or take a break.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.180]   What are you doing?
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.980]   He's miking the squeak.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:52.980]   There we go.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:58.940]   What's this man doing under the table?
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:02.260]   You sound like my chemistry professor in high school.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:02.780]   What's that?
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:03.420]   He used to say that?
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.700]   He had a rule about everybody's hands had to be on the table.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:06.580]   Oh, my God.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:07.780]   That guy had a dirty mind.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.860]   No, he had a lot of high school kids.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.540]   He had high school kids.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.220]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.500]   Philip Elmer, you're going to win his here from Fortune magazine
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:16.780]   from noagendashow.com.
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:20.420]   Mr. John C. Devorak.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.300]   He's always good.
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.540]   And from-- how's it going with it, by the way, with tech thing?
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.380]   It's going.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.900]   We just posted episode six this week.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:32.380]   We've got our iPad and iOS and Apple TV feed sorted out.
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.260]   We're still fighting with the Tivo format.
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:35.780]   But tech thing is growing.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:39.180]   So with the slow fade of revision three,
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:41.660]   Tekzilla canceled, I guess.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:42.580]   High-adis canceled.
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.300]   High-adis, along high-adis.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:44.780]   Yes.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:47.340]   So you said you and Shannon said, let's do our own thing.
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:48.060]   Yes.
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.740]   And yeah, you have to provide the infrastructure.
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.420]   But thanks to things like Patreon,
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:52.980]   you can maybe make it go of it.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.860]   And what is the Patreon address if you want to donate?
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:59.260]   Patreon.com/techthing, T-E-K-T-H-I-N-G.
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:11:59.940]   There you go.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:00.660]   Thanks, man.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:00.980]   There you go.
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:03.540]   Shannon Morse and Patrick Norton.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.180]   And it is Tekzilla, isn't it?
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.260]   I mean, it's pretty similar.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:06.900]   It's very similar.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:07.060]   Very similar.
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:08.660]   Don't tell revision three, but--
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.060]   No, no.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:14.860]   You see, it's the screen savers 4.0 or DLTV 3.0 or Tekzilla 2.0
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.540]   or Teking 1.0.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.020]   There's a thing where we look at--
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:18.780]   I get it.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:19.820]   It's like me.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:21.380]   I had one idea for a show, and I just
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.660]   keep doing the same thing whenever.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:23.660]   Yes.
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:24.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.700]   You know that?
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:26.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:26.900]   You've been with me since--
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.500]   I have no problem with it.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:28.860]   No.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.900]   You get a great idea.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:30.540]   You go with it.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.940]   You run with it till somebody buys it.
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.740]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.220]   I am a big audiobook fan.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.380]   I know-- are you?
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.500]   Do you listen to audiobooks?
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.220]   I started doing it again after-- actually, I--
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:42.820]   Drive a lot.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:46.540]   I rejoined Audible.com at sitting in this podcast one day
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:47.540]   and signed up for it.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.780]   And it's been interesting listening to books
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.500]   that I've read in the past.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.580]   I love it, too.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.020]   Are you an Audible listener?
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:54.860]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:59.180]   I'm in the middle of Robert Carro's four volume.
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:01.620]   I love Johnson.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.820]   I've read the first volume, and I haven't read anymore,
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.980]   because I read the first volume when it came out.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.140]   But he's gotten a lot farther.
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.100]   What a story that is.
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:10.260]   And he hates the guy.
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.340]   He clearly hates Johnson.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.420]   Johnson lied.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:14.820]   He couldn't tell the truth.
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.100]   And it's always--
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.060]   You know what else would be good?
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.180]   And I think Beshloss has some of this on Audible.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:24.020]   You know, Michael Beshloss also has the Johnson tapes.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:27.380]   And I think some of the audio of this--
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.820]   yeah, here it is-- taking charge of the Johnson White House
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:30.940]   tapes.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.340]   You've got to listen to this.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.820]   Michael Beshloss, another great--
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:37.060]   like Robert Carro, kind of a great presidential chronicler.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:42.580]   And you hear Johnson sitting on the toilet talking to people.
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.020]   You hear Johnson talking-- actually, it's very moving--
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.980]   talking about Vietnam.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.620]   Talking about moving, sitting on the toilet.
[01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:49.380]   Yeah.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.420]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:51.740]   I got three of us.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:52.660]   Now we wait for Patrick.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.580]   The thing I liked the most on this one was--
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:56.860]   he's debating the Civil Rights Act,
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:00.700]   and he's talking to his valet, who's an African-American.
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:02.340]   Johnson, who's-- you know, he's a Texan,
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:04.220]   and he's still calling the guy boy.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:08.020]   But he clearly is really moved by the struggle
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.340]   of African-Americans in the '60s.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:13.060]   And it's really interesting to hear.
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.860]   It's hard to hate the man when you listen to the tapes.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.660]   You don't love him.
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:19.900]   God, I remember protesting, hey, hey, LBJ.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.780]   How many kids did you kill today during the war?
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.500]   And you did this?
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:25.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:25.900]   But--
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.860]   He made him crazy that chant.
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.620]   He hated it.
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:31.020]   Oh, well, I don't blame him.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.100]   But that was kind of the point.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.060]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.100]   Anyway, yes.
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.540]   There's a couple of things on Audible.
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.660]   So for history, Audible is wonderful.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:41.300]   But you know, it's great for fiction, too.
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.580]   What I try to do is alternate fiction with nonfiction.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.580]   So I'll listen to a-- right now, I'm
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:47.980]   listening to the incredible biography of the Beatles.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.140]   It's very long and very detailed.
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.180]   But then my next one is going to be a sci-fi novel
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:58.300]   of my favorite sci-fi author, Peter F. Hamilton.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.220]   Just amazing stuff on here.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.780]   They keep giving me free books.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.180]   I don't think that paper--
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:04.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:07.420]   They just say, you know, you've earned another--
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420]   No, they're good about that.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.220]   And you know what else they do?
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.220]   They have very civic minded.
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.780]   During the, for instance, the presidential campaigns,
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.220]   they'll give away speeches, state of the union address.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.340]   There's a lot of stuff--
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.420]   oh, have you read about Hila, the immortal life of Henrietta
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:20.920]   Lax?
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:21.860]   What a story that is.
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:25.820]   Her genes, the Hila genes, are used by scientists to this day.
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:30.620]   She was a poor southern tobacco farmer.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:34.140]   And her cells are continued to be grown in culture.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:34.660]   Yeah.
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:37.060]   Although she's been dead for more than 60 years,
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:39.140]   it's an amazing story.
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.740]   Hila, the Hila cells.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.020]   So you can learn a lot.
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.780]   You can entertain yourself.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.740]   And I've got two free books for you.
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:50.860]   If you go to audible.com/twit.
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:55.780]   And the number two, audible.com/twit2.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:57.900]   At this point, I have to say this is great.
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.140]   Every bestseller comes out on Audible.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:00.820]   Yes.
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:02.940]   So it used to be, you would hope, oh, I
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.980]   hope that they'll put this out on Audible.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.260]   Now everything comes out.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:08.860]   Does Martin Short do the narration of his own book?
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.180]   He sure does.
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.340]   Don't you love Martin Short?
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:12.380]   Yeah, he's hilarious.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.980]   I must say, my life is a humble comedy legend.
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:17.460]   Let's listen to a little bit of this.
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:20.260]   Nevertheless, after questioning both candidates,
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.860]   the interviewer declares, your credentials are so darn equal.
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.700]   And I don't know how to decide.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.220]   I can't make up my mind.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.660]   The male candidate proposes that the matter be settled
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:32.100]   by arm wrestling.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.940]   The interviewer agrees.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.780]   Then the man pins down the woman's arm,
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.340]   thereby winning the job seen.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.180]   Now you're going to have to listen to the rest of the book
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.900]   and find out what the hell he's talking about there.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:43.740]   I must say, my life is a humble comedy legend.
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.180]   Canadian politics is my guess.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.420]   I would guess too.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.660]   But you can get this for free.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:51.580]   There is a lot of biographies and stories by people.
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:52.620]   Neil Patrick Harris.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:54.180]   Yeah, that just came out, didn't it?
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.740]   Choose your own autobiography.
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:58.580]   He wrote it and read it because it's an autobiography.
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.620]   But he reads it too.
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:01.700]   I would say a lot of times you don't want the author
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:02.140]   to read him.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:06.340]   But when it's performers like Sarah Silverman, you do.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.220]   Or Martin Short.
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.340]   Because they really bring it to life.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.100]   Look, there's a lot of choices here.
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.220]   You've got two books free.
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:14.620]   And by the way, when you get the subscription,
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.220]   you're going to get the platinum subscription
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:16.860]   two books a month.
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.140]   You also get the daily digest of the New York Times
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.100]   of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.420]   So that's a great way to keep up on what's going on.
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.260]   The Walter Isaacson book.
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:29.100]   Now, I think rapidly becoming a classic, the innovators.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:29.820]   That's available.
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:30.780]   You can get that for free too.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:34.660]   Just go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:38.060]   And you know, discover the world of audiobooks.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.780]   I'm interested in Philip that you like audible,
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.180]   because you don't have a commute, right?
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:42.020]   I presume you don't.
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:44.300]   No, but I have a dog.
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:46.900]   I walk him every day for about an hour.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.380]   And you can get a lot of book done with that.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:50.580]   It's for me, it's the name.
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.260]   I don't commute, but I'd say nothing more boring
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:55.660]   than being on a treadmill or a bicycle or a rowing machine.
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.020]   But if I'm listening to a book, it kind of goes by fast.
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.860]   Love it.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:04.780]   Microsoft, interesting Microsoft is a very fascinating story
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.100]   now, I think.
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:06.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.500]   Well, for a long time, you and I talked
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.740]   about how boring Microsoft to become, their stock was stagnant.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:12.820]   There was nothing to say.
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:15.260]   They looked like they were going the way of IBM.
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:17.140]   And with the advent of such in Adele
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.540]   and the new Windows 10, I think it's a HoloLens.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.340]   There's some really interesting stuff.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.740]   I just wrote a column about this.
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.500]   What do you think?
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.780]   It's just the opposite.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.300]   You think they're a boring company still?
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.620]   No, I think they should be a boring company.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.820]   Go back to being boring.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.100]   They should get those cash cows.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.780]   They throw money away left and right.
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:32.900]   Nothing works.
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.140]   They're no good at anything.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.740]   They said what they do best, which is office and Windows,
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:37.900]   and that's about it.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.060]   Why don't they just instead of throwing all this money
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.260]   at these stupid things that keep buying for $400 million,
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.700]   a half a million, a billion?
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:44.940]   Give it to the shareholders.
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.740]   They're the ones that's their money.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.140]   They should have big dividends and become just a kind
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:51.300]   of a stayed, steady company.
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:52.540]   Just fade off into the stuff.
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.540]   There's nothing to fade off.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.300]   There's tons of PCs being sold every year.
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.940]   They do have new operating systems that come out.
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.260]   And you have to have office because there's nothing else
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.540]   that-- Instead, they're giving away Windows 10.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.620]   Yeah, but this all seems like an idiocy to me.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.420]   And they kind of give away office.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:11.460]   I just got a $229 HP stream.
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.300]   $229 laptop computer running.
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:15.380]   Windows 8 with a year of office free.
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.780]   Is it the full office that you get used on five machines?
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:18.300]   Yeah, it's cool.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:18.940]   I was actually--
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:19.980]   No, one machine.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:23.540]   After I replaced my broken and bent iPhone,
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.580]   there was a Microsoft store in the mall.
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:26.900]   And that was the first thing I found.
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:31.060]   It was like there's an 11-inch HP stream for $199.99.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.820]   It runs really well.
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:33.700]   You know what I just bought?
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:37.060]   And I'm really very interested about this.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.180]   This is a 7-inch tablet from Winbook.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:44.100]   $60 with a full version of Windows 8.1 on it.
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.780]   That's a really good deal, but of course,
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.140]   it's $60.
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:48.660]   What's the process, sir?
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:50.420]   It's a Bay Trail.
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:52.180]   Decent 1.3 gighertz.
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:53.740]   Only a gig of RAM.
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:54.940]   16 gigs of flash storage.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:57.260]   But you could put another 64 gigs of microSD
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.340]   and do one thing at a time.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:00.180]   Yeah, but you know what?
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.180]   It's a 7-inch tablet.
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:04.260]   I don't think I'm going to be multitasking my video while
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.420]   I'm writing the Great American Mobile.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.020]   Well, you say that until you have seven things open
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:09.100]   that you're switching between and you're waiting for.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:09.860]   Well, see, that's why I ordered--
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.620]   first of all, low price entry.
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:12.940]   But I'm very curious.
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:13.820]   What are you going to get?
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:15.100]   And one of the reasons this exists
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:18.420]   is because Microsoft says if it's a sub-8-inch display,
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:19.940]   you don't have to pay us for Windows.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.300]   It's free.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.620]   They're giving it away, as you say.
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.380]   And 7-inch tablets are really cheap to build in China.
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.220]   I mean, they're in 59 bucks.
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.500]   I don't even know how this--
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.540]   What's the profit on a $59 tablet?
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.900]   They're dumping it.
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:36.860]   You think that they-- what?
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:38.820]   It's a regular $230 tablet.
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:41.100]   So I'm assuming they're just moving--
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.620]   It's regular 89.99.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:43.620]   Well, that's their old price.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.780]   But if you look on Amazon, they show the old price
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:48.380]   when this number was--
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:49.740]   The TW 700.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.660]   Well, I ordered when it comes Tuesday, I'll let you know.
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:54.060]   It's inventory clearance.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.860]   Maybe that's it, but still a good deal.
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.540]   They give you a copy of Office again.
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:58.180]   There's a huge--
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:20:59.020]   Again with a copy of Office.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.820]   There's a huge $100 tablet market.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.420]   I think so.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:05.220]   And this has a full-size USB port.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:09.100]   So you could plug in a keyboard in your mouse
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:12.300]   and continue to charge it through the regular USB port.
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:12.660]   I don't know.
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.860]   It's a very-- IPS display.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:14.820]   It's not a bad display.
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:16.260]   What are you going to do with it?
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.340]   I don't have nothing I'm going to do with it.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:18.500]   And you get Office for a year.
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.980]   But it tells you Microsoft is up to something.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:23.780]   They have more than 100 apps.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:27.060]   If you search for Microsoft on the Apple iPad store
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:31.460]   more than 100 apps, what?
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.860]   Doesn't seem possible.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:35.020]   But why are they there?
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.420]   Because I think that this is a new Microsoft.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.100]   The rumor is-- and this is what stimulated the conversation--
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.820]   that the Galaxy S6, which will be announced in March,
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:47.380]   a mobile world congress, instead of having Google Apps on it,
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.940]   it's going to have Microsoft Apps on it.
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:51.140]   That would be pretty huge.
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:52.660]   That's a big selling phone, right?
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:56.940]   We're talking tens of millions of devices out there.
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:59.020]   You'll see Word Excel PowerPoint Outlook,
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:01.660]   which as you say, John, they bought for--
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:02.340]   what was it?
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:02.740]   $200 million?
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:03.660]   $400 million?
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.780]   They bought a Complee, an iOS app.
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:10.460]   And they just bought Sunrise, a calendar app for $200 million.
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:11.420]   Maybe it's $200 million.
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:14.580]   They don't have coders that can do these apps in-house.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.500]   Most of these hundred apps are--
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.620]   you see and you're going through them.
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:18.460]   You see all those apps?
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:20.460]   I don't know if I'm finding 100 here, but--
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.500]   Word, big search, Excel.
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.620]   It's a title, a account.
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.540]   I did it on my iPad.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.420]   It's a lot.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.380]   It's dozens.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.100]   We just--
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:30.500]   No, we wait.
[01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:32.020]   We get from 100 to a dozen.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.900]   It was like 68, OK?
[01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:34.900]   OK.
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:37.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.060]   Just call me Brian Williams.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.620]   It's a little bit of an exaggeration.
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:46.460]   I looked down the barrel of the RPG, and I saw 100.
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.220]   Just a little exaggeration.
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:50.420]   I mean, a lot of them are stuff people's probably--
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:51.420]   What an enterprise.
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.620]   Emissant food and drink.
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.860]   Bing get me there.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:55.860]   Emissant sports, Emissant health and fitness.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.660]   Microsoft and Emissie are Em for iPhone.
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:58.020]   There you go.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.380]   There's a lot of business stuff like that.
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.140]   The Age of Empires crafting guide.
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.020]   Love that game.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:09.700]   I wonder if Microsoft is a little worried about the IBM
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.620]   Apple initiative.
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:15.140]   I mean, here we've got IBM going to their clients
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:21.860]   and hawking and making iOS apps for them.
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:24.140]   You know, that was Microsoft's--
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:27.260]   Those are Microsoft's clients.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:31.980]   And so it makes sense for them to make sure
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:34.620]   that their bread and butter is on that.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:35.940]   Well, that's what I find interesting.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:38.180]   Microsoft is fighting on all fronts, which
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.100]   is historically not a good idea.
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:43.900]   They're giving away Windows 10 with a Raspberry Pi 2,
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.580]   and they're putting enterprise apps on the Galaxy 6.
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:53.460]   I think it's really smart to give away Windows 10
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:57.740]   in a lot of ways because they had such a misfire
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:58.820]   with the launch of Windows 8.
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.380]   Is it kind of an apology?
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.300]   I think it's just a way to just try
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:08.460]   to get corporations and enterprise users to move to Windows 10.
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.220]   You got the licenses.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:11.420]   We'll make it cheap.
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:13.980]   You're pissed off, Microsoft fan.
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:15.780]   We'll give you Windows 10 for free.
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:17.620]   Have you played with Windows 10?
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.540]   Did you load one?
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:19.620]   Or you got Windows 10 there?
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.820]   I don't see that as that radically different than Windows 10.
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.180]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.700]   Well, which in what way?
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:28.100]   Well, for one thing, it's back to desktop focus.
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:31.100]   They got rid of the charms bar, which was really strange.
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.420]   And they replaced it with a notification center
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.220]   that actually works really well, allows you
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.700]   to customize it with quick launch items.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:40.460]   It does look a little bit almost exactly like what
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:42.660]   Apple's done with OS 10.
[01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:45.980]   I think they brought back the start menu, which was a big silly,
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.500]   but a pain point for a lot of people.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.780]   And the start menu works quite well.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:50.380]   We like it.
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:52.820]   And they put Cortana on it, which I think is very interesting.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:53.700]   You can talk to it.
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:58.140]   Cortana, I'm still not particularly great about talking
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:00.740]   to my desktop or my laptop.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.700]   But yeah, I mean, I think it's smart for them
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:03.860]   to give away the operating system.
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:10.660]   I think it's smart for them to push really hard on iOS and Android.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.180]   I think it would be a huge win for them
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:16.540]   if they got their applications on Android.
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:20.420]   Because they got CS6 instead of the Samsung calendar app,
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.220]   which no one wanted.
[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.460]   You put Microsoft's out there.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:28.660]   Well, Samsung is like the shovelware of Android operating
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:28.980]   systems.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.260]   I love their hardware.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:33.180]   But Samsung's interpretation of Android drives me nuts.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:33.500]   I agree.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.940]   This note for is a spectacular phone.
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:39.140]   Someone in the chatroom pointed out
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:41.700]   that Windows 10 Enterprise will not be free.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:42.200]   No.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.140]   In fact, we've said that many times on Windows Weekly,
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:46.220]   they're giving away Windows 10.
[01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.860]   But if you're in business, you're going to buy it.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.020]   And that's a smart move also.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.060]   You still make money on Windows.
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:51.580]   They're not going to give it up revenue.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:53.620]   You're still a big fan of Windows 7.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.260]   I am, and I hated Windows 8.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:26:00.060]   And I feel like Windows 10 is back to the Mojo that--
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:01.900]   Windows 10 is to what Windows 8 will
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:03.300]   Windows 7 was to Windows Vista.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.900]   Maybe even more so.
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:06.740]   Maybe even more so.
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:07.380]   I'm excited.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.260]   I like Windows 10.
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:08.740]   OK.
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.860]   Not having used it as a full--
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.340]   I'm surprised you used it full time.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.340]   Is that the new XPS 13 you got?
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:14.680]   No.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.740]   That's last year's XPS 13.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.700]   The new XPS 13 is a fantastic--
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:19.140]   I have it.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.620]   I love it.
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:21.460]   I love it.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.540]   Delsend you one?
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:23.820]   No, I bought it.
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:24.660]   Good man.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.220]   It's everything.
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:28.740]   It wasn't that cheap because I was 11.40
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.100]   because I got an i5.
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:30.540]   I got a--
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.980]   He gets it when it first comes out.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:32.620]   So it's always--
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.940]   Well, they made it available without a touch screen.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.460]   2.6 pounds.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.140]   And I wanted the touch screen.
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:41.420]   So I got the QHD screen, which hurts battery life.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:42.460]   But it's a beautiful screen.
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:44.220]   Now, how come you're not using it here?
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:45.300]   I was using it here.
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:46.340]   Why am I not using it here?
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:48.900]   Because I hate Windows 8.1 with a passion
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.140]   and a fire that burns like--
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.940]   Throw the technical preview on there.
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:52.940]   What's the science from that?
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.180]   I'm so tempted to do that.
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:54.620]   Do it.
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:55.340]   You should.
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:55.780]   Do it.
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:56.340]   It works.
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:57.340]   No, that works that way.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:57.940]   It still works.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:58.300]   It works fine.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:26:59.940]   You've been using it as your production machine?
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:01.340]   I've been using it as my production machine
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:02.980]   since it came out.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:04.580]   I've had one blue screen and it was
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:06.540]   a lib related to a bizarre app that--
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.020]   And that can happen to anybody.
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:08.460]   You should--
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:09.700]   The route's using his production machine too.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.220]   I just-- I guess I could.
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:12.020]   Yes, you should.
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:14.940]   That'd be pretty modern of me to be using a Windows 10 machine.
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:15.340]   Yes.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:17.260]   And the Spartan browser, the new browser.
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:17.620]   Is it?
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:18.540]   How do you like that?
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:20.460]   I don't think I've actually opened it up yet.
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.500]   I put Chrome on every version.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.420]   That was no matter.
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:25.460]   I've actually been using Firefox a lot again lately.
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.460]   Chrome got so bloated at one point
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:30.100]   and was just sucking down so much in terms of resources
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:31.380]   I started using Firefox again.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:32.580]   I'm all in on Google.
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.860]   Maybe you haven't noticed.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:34.300]   Yes.
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.140]   I am pushing all the chips.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.540]   So why aren't you running a Chromebook?
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.020]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:39.540]   $200.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:42.100]   There's a very good reason because I cannot get video
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:42.900]   out of the Chromebook.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:45.540]   I have a Pixel, which Google did give me
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:48.020]   because I went to Google I/O so that was two years ago.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.180]   I did not buy the Pixel.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:52.780]   But you cannot get because it's a weird aspect ratio.
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:53.980]   It's a 4.3.
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:56.780]   And Chrome OS does not let us put out
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.380]   anything that our video capture stuff will use.
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:27:59.860]   That's a little--
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:02.180]   So literally, that is the barrier for you
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.100]   to living a completely Google-occupied lifestyle.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:08.500]   No, Skype's the barrier.
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.940]   I need Skype and there's no Skype on Chromebooks.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:13.420]   But you notice all I do on this, when I'm on this one,
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:14.980]   it's all browser.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.140]   I mean, Chromebook would be fine for this.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:18.020]   Kaspersky.
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.100]   You were the one who introduced me to Kaspersky.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.300]   Probably.
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:22.020]   That was years ago.
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:25.020]   Years ago was your favorite antivirus.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:28.580]   Was started by a Russian guy named Kaspersky.
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:29.580]   Eugene.
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.740]   Eugene Kaspersky.
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:33.540]   You know him.
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:34.580]   Do you?
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:35.620]   No.
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.460]   So Kiev Kev.
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:39.620]   See, that's how you can tell if somebody's Russian.
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:40.940]   Yeah, they can't speak up on you.
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.820]   So hey, what are these capital of Ukraine?
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:46.180]   You know, that's where the Russian Republic began.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:46.820]   And Kiev.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:47.460]   Yeah.
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.060]   Is where Kruschif was from, right?
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:49.580]   I don't know.
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:50.300]   Wasn't he Ukraine?
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:50.700]   That's all I know.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.980]   I cut it off at that one piece of information.
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:56.260]   Eugene Kaspersky, who still is apparently
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:59.740]   quite involved with the Kaspersky Labs,
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:04.780]   was called in by an unnamed bank.
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.940]   In-- oh, where was it?
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:09.660]   Was it China?
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:11.980]   Was it called in by an unnamed bank saying,
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:15.220]   we're a little concerned because our ATMs
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:19.260]   have been just spewing money at random intervals.
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:22.100]   Don't we want to know the name of this bank?
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:23.860]   The Kaspersky says we can't tell you.
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:25.340]   It's NDA.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.660]   And the bank, of course, ain't going to tell you.
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:29.580]   But they said the weirdest things happening
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:33.340]   because the ATM will go, all this money comes out.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.740]   And exactly that time, some guy comes by and swoops it up
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.820]   and the bank and goes away.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:37.740]   Coincidence.
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:38.340]   Coincidence?
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:40.980]   I think not.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:44.020]   What happened is the Kaspersky got in there
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:48.260]   and discovered that the bank had been co-opted
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:50.220]   by spearfishing attacks.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.980]   Emails sent specifically to employees of the bank,
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:56.100]   containing malware coming from colleagues saying,
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:57.980]   oh, you ought to see this video.
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:02.260]   The malware infected the bank, particularly with a rat,
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:05.060]   a remote access Trojan, which allowed the bad guys
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.260]   to turn on the cameras.
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:08.180]   You're the one who says tape them over, right?
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.060]   Turn on the cameras.
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:12.780]   On all the computers in the bank, at screenshots,
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.860]   they sat quietly for several months,
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:18.980]   observing bank employees, finding out exactly how
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.180]   the operations worked.
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:23.540]   It turns out the hackers have been active doing this,
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:26.300]   not just in this bank, but since the end of 2013,
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.860]   in more than 100 banks, in 30 countries,
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:33.700]   and they have scored as much as a billion dollars.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:36.420]   What they'll do is they'll send in people pretending
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.980]   to be from the bank.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:41.580]   They'll co-opt the software and the ATMs.
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.860]   This is going to come out Monday, a security conference
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.300]   in Cancun.
[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:48.660]   New York Times had the article this Sunday,
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.460]   and I was reading it in the Sunday.
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.380]   You know, I get the print Sunday times.
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.020]   I used to.
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:53.660]   I love it.
[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:55.340]   It stacks up.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:55.900]   It does.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:59.860]   And you know what's great about it is you can have a barbecue.
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:03.740]   You know, you'd be having two or three barbecues a day.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:05.220]   That's how much paper stacks up.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:06.140]   It's a lot of paper.
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:10.580]   In fact, the Sunday times, by itself,
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:12.580]   is like you could make furniture out of it.
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:17.460]   So very interesting story.
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.740]   There he is. There's Eugene.
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:19.580]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:20.580]   That's Sergei Golovinov.
[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:23.460]   All these Russians look alike.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:24.780]   Do you notice that?
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:25.620]   Not really.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.620]   They all look alike.
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:30.540]   I'm being silly, obviously.
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.380]   It was in the Ukraine of all places.
[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:34.340]   That's where the bank was.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.420]   This is where I came in.
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:38.060]   This is all, this is a circle.
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:42.820]   But the criminal group includes Russians, Chinese and Europeans.
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:45.300]   And the group impersonated bank officers,
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:48.380]   not only turning on various cash machines,
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:51.060]   but they also transferred money directly
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:52.900]   from banks in Russia, Japan, Switzerland,
[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:55.340]   the US and the Netherlands into dummy accounts.
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:59.260]   Just, I mean, mind boggling.
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:01.820]   Kaspersky says, "We've seen evidence of $300 million
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:03.260]   "in thefts through clients,
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:06.220]   "but we believe the total could be three times that."
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:09.220]   You know why it wasn't more?
[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:11.220]   Banks did one thing smart.
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:14.220]   They limited transactions to $10 million each.
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.220]   No, no, the thefts were limited
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:18.220]   to $10 million per transaction.
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.220]   Yes.
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:21.220]   No, it's because the ATM machine only has so much money in it.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:23.220]   No, they were doing, it sounded like they were doing wire transfers.
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:24.220]   They were doing wire transfers.
[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:26.220]   That's the big dough.
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:30.220]   No bank has come forward to acknowledge the theft.
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.220]   In fact, President Obama and Friday,
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:35.220]   we did that the Security Summit, right,
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:37.220]   in Silicon Valley at the Stanford University.
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.220]   At the time said, "There should be a law that would,
[01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.220]   "there ought to be a law."
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:43.220]   When I say that meaningless,
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:44.220]   when the president says that, it has some way.
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:48.220]   You know, he put out an executive order saying that the end of the stuff.
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:50.220]   It's not going to happen anymore.
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:51.220]   No more hacking.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.220]   Buy order.
[01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:56.220]   He urged passage of a law that would require public disclosure of any breach
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.220]   that compromised personal financial information.
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:32:59.220]   And we know this very well.
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.220]   You know this.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.220]   Banks, you know this.
[01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:03.220]   We remember we talked to the Secret Service
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:05.220]   and they said, "Oh, this happens all the time."
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:07.220]   But banks just don't say it because they don't want to remind them.
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.220]   It's embarrassing.
[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:09.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:14.220]   Financial, the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center,
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:18.220]   which is a consortium that alerts banks to suspicious activity,
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:22.220]   said, "Our members are aware of this activity.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:25.220]   "We have disseminated intelligence on this attack to the members,
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:29.220]   "and some briefings were also provided to law enforcement entities,
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:31.220]   "by law enforcement entities."
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:35.220]   When asked, when the Times asked the American Bankers Association to comment,
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:39.220]   they said, "What those guys said?
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:41.220]   "Nobody wants to comment about this."
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:43.220]   I think it's not just embarrassment.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:47.220]   I think they could get sued.
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:52.220]   I mean, they don't want their clients to...
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:54.220]   I think, I don't know.
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.220]   I really know also.
[01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:56.220]   Also, they...
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:59.220]   Why do banks build big buildings with...
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:00.220]   They used to.
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.220]   Now they're in the law.
[01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:02.220]   No, now they're yeah.
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.220]   But in the old-day...
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.220]   Trailers.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.220]   They wanted to...
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:07.220]   You have to trust the bank, so they built this giant...
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:09.220]   And it used to have a safer money win, but now it's all...
[01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:11.220]   It's safe where the money goes.
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:12.220]   In fact, no money in it.
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:13.220]   We have that bank.
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:14.220]   The Petaluma, right at the crossroads...
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:15.220]   The Seed Bank.
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:16.220]   It's now...
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:17.220]   They sell seeds.
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:19.220]   But it was...
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.220]   It's...
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:21.220]   It's got the columns.
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:22.220]   It's got the big safe.
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:23.220]   It's a beautiful building.
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:25.220]   They keep the really good seeds in the safe.
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:26.220]   The heirloom stuff.
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:28.220]   No, actually, it's all heirloom seeds there.
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:29.220]   It's amazing.
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:30.220]   It's run by men and they're all overpriced.
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:31.220]   It's not overpriced.
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:32.220]   It's not even in place.
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:33.220]   It's all...
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:34.220]   Well, just let it go.
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:35.220]   I found out the story.
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:37.220]   No, I found out the story.
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:38.220]   The Seed Bank.
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:42.220]   Because we had looked at that property when we were looking for property.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:43.220]   We knew it was $10,000 a month.
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:46.220]   And we thought, "Well, we don't want that."
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:50.220]   So how can you make $10,000 a month and selling seeds?
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:51.220]   Right.
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:53.220]   Which are like 50 cents a packet.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.220]   Well, it's their marijuana seed.
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:56.220]   You nailed it.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:57.220]   I asked them.
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:00.220]   They said, "Well, we thought that there..."
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:03.460]   Because two years ago there was an initiative to legalize marijuana.
[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:05.460]   These guys came all the way out from Ohio.
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.580]   They said, "We thought that that would pass.
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:12.740]   And since we are here at the gateway to the marijuana growing area, which is north of
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.220]   us in Mendocino, they said, "We thought we would be there.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:21.940]   We would sell the primo seeds as the guys were driving up to plant their crops."
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:22.940]   I swear to God.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:23.940]   Well, now...
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:24.940]   Interesting theory.
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:28.300]   Well, now they're just holding a holding pattern until they do legalize it.
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:29.860]   It'll be legalized eventually.
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:30.860]   It's a matter of time.
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:32.860]   What does Adam say about that?
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:35.380]   He doesn't really discuss it as much as I do.
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:36.380]   What do you say about it?
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:39.580]   I think it's a humiliation to the state of California.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:43.940]   Because ever since I was a kid and then when I went to the University of California, all
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:47.140]   I heard about for a day, "Oh, it's going to be legalized.
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.140]   It's going to be legalized.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.140]   It should be legalized.
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:51.420]   It's going to be legalized for 20, 30 years.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.020]   We get the opportunity.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:54.380]   We vote no."
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:55.980]   I know what's wrong with California.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:58.660]   And then meanwhile, Washington votes yes in Colorado.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:35:59.660]   I was in Oregon.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:00.660]   I was in Oregon.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:02.860]   I was in a marriage before California did.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:04.020]   It's a screwed up state.
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:05.020]   No, no.
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:06.020]   It's a big state with a diverse...
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:07.020]   It's a bunch of talkers.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:08.020]   There's a big blow hard.
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:09.820]   It's got a diverse electorate.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:10.980]   It's got southern.
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:11.980]   You got northern.
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:12.980]   It really is almost two states entirely.
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:14.780]   It's more like three states.
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:15.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.820]   So Apple, by the way, did banned marijuana apps in the App Store for a long time?
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:20.820]   You could not.
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:23.340]   But there was this app called Mass Roots.
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:24.340]   It's back.
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:25.340]   It's good for them.
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:28.220]   So even Apple acknowledges that you got a talk up some time.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:30.140]   I'm so sure on network for cannabis users.
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:31.140]   There's a twist.
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:33.140]   You have a day at a pizza.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.940]   Little stone meat.
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:35.940]   Go ahead.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:36.940]   Hey man.
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:37.940]   The myth is trick.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:38.940]   It's a stoner side.
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:39.940]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:40.940]   You fill up.
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:41.940]   Go on.
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:45.100]   I would go back there, but I forgot my password, man.
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:46.100]   Go ahead, Philip.
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:51.380]   The way that Apple allows it is they use your location to make sure you're in a state
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:55.060]   where marijuana is legal otherwise.
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.900]   Oh, not just legal.
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:59.460]   It can't be completely legal.
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:01.660]   It can be medical marijuana.
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:03.900]   Which is, by the way, 23 out of the 50 states.
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:05.900]   I didn't realize it was so widespread.
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:10.780]   Well, some, Massachusetts has medical marijuana, but they have no dispensaries.
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:12.260]   So it's moot.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:16.700]   Daniel Cooper wrote the best article about this in Engadget.
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:21.140]   Mass Roots Social Network for Cannabis Users contravened Apple's policy of banning apps
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:23.780]   that promote drug use and had to go.
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:27.780]   Two weeks after this issue was made, an army of hemp-wearing advocates had managed to
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:30.620]   convince the iPhone maker to change his mind.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.460]   You sound like that other character.
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:35.340]   It's the guy in the Simpsons that punk guy, what's his name?
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:39.580]   It's now legal to enjoy jazz cigarettes for medicinal purposes.
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:44.300]   Making Apple one of those boring squares that just needed to stop being such a narc.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.300]   Man.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:49.460]   Mass Roots teamed up with the professional hopheads at the National Cannabis Industry
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:54.620]   Association and that beardy guy who lives in a trailer down by the freight yard.
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:55.620]   What?
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.620]   What?
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:59.380]   And you're right.
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:04.420]   It can only be downloaded by members, residents of those 23 states where it's legal.
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:10.260]   So it will check your geolocation before you're allowed to get a hit, if you know what I mean.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:11.940]   You do a good stoner of course.
[01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:16.180]   That's many years of practice, man.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:19.900]   And then he finishes the article as a rejoinder.
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:24.500]   It also vowed to stop treading ash into the carpet and will stop playing the bongos after
[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.260]   11 p.m. on a school night.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:30.340]   Can you say, I thought we'd have a pizza on our time, Mr. Hand?
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:32.780]   Yeah, that's, I'm Speccoli, aren't I?
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:33.980]   That's Speccoli.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:36.140]   I thought we'd have a pizza on our time.
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.780]   Yeah, that's who that is.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:39.620]   Anyway, Mass Roots.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:42.020]   I don't know how we got into this from the bank institution.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:43.020]   Where's the decision?
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:44.020]   You did it.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:45.020]   The bare-seeds seat.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:47.180]   The bank, that's where it came in.
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:48.180]   And the whole seed catalog.
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:49.540]   I live in the New York Times.
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:51.540]   That place is expensive.
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.300]   The seed bank.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.940]   But you keep looking at me.
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:58.220]   Where else are you going to get like heirloom watermelon seeds?
[01:38:58.220 --> 01:38:59.220]   From an heirloom watermelon.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.300]   I bet you could look up heirloom watermelon seeds and get them on here.
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:03.300]   Well, that's the funny thing.
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.660]   If you go to the seed bank, they have a big online presence.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:08.660]   That's how they make all their money is online seed sales.
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:11.660]   They're just, they're poised waiting for marijuana to be legal.
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:12.860]   How do you think you'd be building?
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:14.860]   It's amazing carrot seeds.
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:15.860]   I rented an air.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:16.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:17.860]   Go ahead.
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:18.860]   I'm sorry, Phil.
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:19.860]   It's okay.
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:23.940]   I rented an Airbnb in Barcelona from a guy who I said, "What do you do?"
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:27.860]   He said, "Oh, I do online sales for a seed company."
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:28.860]   That's it, probably.
[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:29.860]   In Spain.
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:31.780]   And I said, "Well, they have a lot of online sales.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.860]   They said, "Yeah, it's all marijuana seeds."
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:34.860]   Wow.
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:38.300]   Maybe that's the same people.
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:44.100]   So you saw in the promo, we talked to this new Google thing.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.900]   If you go to, I'm not going to do it again, but if you go to the Play Store and you go
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:52.700]   to the device section, I think this is everybody.
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.860]   It's maybe not.
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:56.540]   I've heard they're rolling this out, but if you go to the device section and you click
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:00.460]   the Help button, there's a Live Chat button.
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.300]   And so we pressed it and the guy appears.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.740]   And I asked him, he said, "Google, he's in Mountain View.
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:05.740]   He's like an actual Google..."
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:07.100]   He appears on the screen?
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.100]   He appears on the screen where he showed the promo.
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:11.180]   We were talking to him.
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:12.180]   But I said something.
[01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:13.380]   I said, "Well, this must be helpouts, right?
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:18.660]   Because Google has this great Hangouts technology where you can pay an expert of any...
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:22.820]   They preset the amount to get help in all sorts of things, cooking or playing the guitar
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:25.100]   or balancing your checkbook."
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:26.100]   And I said, "Is this helpouts?"
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.780]   He said, "No.
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:29.140]   Now I know why."
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:30.980]   Google's phasing helpouts out.
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:31.980]   They killed it.
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:33.900]   They killed it.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:34.900]   Which kind of bums me out?
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:36.340]   I thought this was a great service.
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:38.220]   Yeah, Google's really quick on the...
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:39.300]   They kill stuff now.
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:40.460]   They do, don't they?
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.460]   And I...
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:42.700]   Do you think this hurts them a little bit?
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:44.460]   Like people will be reluctant to adopt Google.
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:46.460]   I'm sure they studied it and it found it...
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:47.460]   Nobody cares.
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:48.460]   Nobody used it.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.460]   Well, nobody cares about them canceling products.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.300]   I do because I join every Google product.
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:53.620]   As you know, I may have mentioned this.
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.860]   I'm all in on Google.
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:55.860]   Yes.
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:57.580]   In fact, I think Patrick pounded that point home.
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:59.300]   They killed Google Reader.
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:02.460]   They killed Latitude, which I use, the location service.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.460]   They killed Schemer.
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:04.460]   Remember that?
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:05.460]   No, you don't.
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.460]   And it will must be...
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:07.460]   Wave.
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:08.460]   RSS.
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:11.460]   RSS.
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:15.220]   So, helpouts, which was only two years old, is gone.
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:16.220]   Mm.
[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:18.380]   God, it was such a good...
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:19.820]   Google's funny with service.
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:23.860]   I mean, someone made a business decision early on that it was...
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:25.060]   The numbers were not right.
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:27.500]   They didn't really want to service all these people.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:28.500]   Right.
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:30.100]   And so, you know, if you...
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.100]   You have a problem with Google or YouTube.
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.500]   It's really difficult to find a hustle.
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:39.340]   I mean, basically you have to Google the earth to find someone else who's had the same
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:41.940]   problem to find the solution.
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:42.940]   Somebody in the chat...
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:43.940]   I'm sorry, go on.
[01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:44.940]   Go ahead.
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:47.180]   Someone in the chat room asked about Google Voice.
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:48.180]   Google Voice is still there.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:49.180]   It's still worse.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.180]   There's always been...
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:52.100]   We're not always, but from last year there's been a rumor that they were going to kill
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:53.660]   it, and that would kill me.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:56.460]   I would not like that because I use it for my instant messaging.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.460]   I use it for everything.
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:59.140]   I use it for a lot.
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:03.460]   But I think what's happening with Voice as it turns out is it's being merged bit by bit
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:05.460]   inch by inch in the hangouts.
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:06.460]   Really?
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:07.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:10.380]   Well, don't you...
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:12.340]   I mean, you're still using it for text messaging?
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:13.340]   I use it for text messages.
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:15.100]   Does it say to you over and over?
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:16.100]   You should be using hangouts?
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:17.100]   No.
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:18.100]   I've never gotten that message.
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:19.100]   Really?
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.100]   No.
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.100]   I use it all the time.
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:22.100]   All right.
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:23.100]   Google Voice is very nice.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:24.820]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:29.460]   When we come back, we'll find out why and how one man could have deleted every photo album
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:31.020]   on Facebook but didn't.
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:32.980]   It's thoughtful of him.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.780]   Wow.
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:37.260]   I think this guy should be celebrated.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.260]   He should be...
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.260]   We should make this guy a hero.
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:45.260]   Instead, he reported the bug to Facebook but his name is Laxman.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:47.860]   That can't be his real name.
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:48.860]   Laxman.
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:49.860]   Laxman.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:50.860]   Joe E. Laxman.
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:51.860]   Is that a...
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:52.860]   Joe E. Laxman.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:53.860]   No, it's Laxman.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:54.860]   Laxman...
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:56.260]   No, that's his first name.
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:57.260]   Oh, is Laxman his first name?
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:58.260]   Laxman Mutia.
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:42:59.260]   Oh.
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:00.260]   It could be...
[01:43:00.260 --> 01:43:03.260]   We'll talk about this in just a second but first let me talk about my mattress.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:05.260]   Are you happy with your mattress?
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:06.260]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:08.260]   Are you happy with your mattress?
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:09.260]   Yes.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:12.260]   See, if you guys have said yes, I would have sent you Casper mattresses if you said no.
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:13.260]   Free?
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:14.260]   My mattress sucks.
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:15.260]   Yes, it's too late.
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:16.260]   No, no, no.
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:19.260]   I'm being a mattress for the Airstream but I have sent Casper mattresses who Paul Theron
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:20.260]   has a Casper now.
[01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:25.460]   A lot of our hosts, Steve Gibson has a Casper now or Steve declined as well because he said
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:26.460]   I don't want a new mattress.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:29.660]   Well, that's probably because it's pain in the ass to get the old mattress out.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:30.660]   No.
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:31.660]   Well, I don't know.
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:32.660]   Maybe.
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:33.660]   Casper.
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:34.660]   This is so cool.
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:37.260]   I'm not going to buy a mattress online.
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:49.620]   Even though I tell you this, you're made in the US, they are premium mattresses made
[01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:50.620]   out of...
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:55.220]   They've got latex for firmness and then there's memory foam on top of it so it gives you
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:57.300]   a nice comfortable sink and bounce.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:03.420]   It comes in a box, that tiny little box, you open it up, it becomes a queen-sized mattress.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:05.300]   Now you may say, "Well, what if I don't like it?"
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:07.780]   Well, you got 100 days to return it.
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:12.780]   Absolutely painless returns, free delivery but 100 days, you don't have to lie down and
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:13.900]   show them to try a mattress.
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:21.620]   You can literally bring it home, jump on it, enjoy that mattress for 99.9 days.
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.620]   This is you in the video.
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:23.620]   Yes.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:24.620]   Me.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:25.620]   Who else would it be?
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:26.620]   I'd be anybody.
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.620]   Look at that.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:28.620]   Ah.
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:29.620]   And then my dog tried it.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:30.620]   My dog liked it.
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:31.620]   Aussie loves it.
[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:32.780]   Casper mattresses are super comfortable.
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:37.340]   We sent one to my son who's in a...
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:40.860]   He moved out of the dorms into a house and it was up three flights.
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.500]   They couldn't get a mattress up the three flights.
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:43.500]   We sent him the box.
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:44.900]   It's beautiful, very comfy.
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:45.900]   He loves it.
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:47.060]   And affordable.
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:51.860]   You're getting premium mattresses made in the US for $500 for a twin, 950 for the king's
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:56.660]   size and I'm going to give you 50 bucks off if you use the promo code TWIT at Casper.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:45:01.220]   C-A-S-P-E-R, Casper.com/TwIT.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.980]   Use the promo code TWIT to get 50 bucks off.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:04.460]   And again, no risk at all.
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:07.620]   You have 100 days they'll come and get it if you don't like it.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:10.980]   Casper is fantastic.
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:12.700]   They're cool in the summer.
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:13.700]   They're warm in the winter.
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:14.700]   I don't know how they do it.
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:16.420]   It's like a thermos bottle.
[01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:17.420]   It's just brilliant.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:19.620]   It's just really well designed and very comfy.
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:20.620]   Casper.
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:25.140]   In fact, if you go to the website you can see how they make it and all sorts of stuff.
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:26.140]   My new hero.
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:29.300]   They don't pick up your old mattress.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:32.140]   Ah, no, I guess not.
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:33.140]   But you know, it's easy.
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:35.620]   You just call Goodwill and they will come and get your old mattress.
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:36.620]   That's not a problem.
[01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:37.820]   They come in a truck.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:39.820]   Two guys, big guys, kind of like you.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:40.820]   They pick it up.
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:41.820]   They take it out.
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:43.460]   That's what we did.
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:44.900]   Goodwill takes your mattresses.
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:45.900]   Okay.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:46.900]   Too late.
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:47.900]   You should have said yes.
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:48.900]   Yeah, sure.
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:50.700]   You should have said I don't like my mattress.
[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:52.260]   Leah, what could I do to get a better?
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:53.260]   I'll send you one.
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:54.260]   You want one?
[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:55.260]   Sure.
[01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:56.260]   My son could use it.
[01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:57.260]   Your son.
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:58.260]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:00.260]   What size bed does he have?
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:01.260]   Big.
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:03.100]   He's married.
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:04.900]   Oh, there's two of them.
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:05.900]   Yeah.
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:06.900]   Oh, well, I cost you.
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:09.620]   No, you want a queen or a king?
[01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:10.620]   I don't know what the difference is.
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:11.620]   They have California.
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:12.620]   Well, it got a queen.
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:13.620]   King's bigger than the queen.
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:14.620]   Is that always true?
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:17.820]   I thought the California queen was the biggest.
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:19.460]   No, the California king is.
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.460]   The California king.
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:22.060]   California queens are ones in San Francisco.
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:23.060]   There's no keys.
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:25.980]   Hey, hey, I'm up two to one.
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:28.220]   Does Adam laugh when you say things like that?
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:29.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:30.220]   Yeah.
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:31.860]   He says, you know Leah would think that's funny.
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:34.180]   I bet he does.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:41.900]   So I, my new hero, Laxman Mutia, figured out how any photo album that he could view, whether
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:46.060]   because it was a friend or because it was public and a lot of stuff on Facebook is public,
[01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.460]   he could delete.
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:51.380]   He could delete billions of images.
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:56.640]   Facebook is now the most popular photo sharing site in the world.
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:01.300]   Look at this, 350 million photos, 350 million photos are uploaded to Facebook every single
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:02.300]   day.
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.300]   Aren't they backed up?
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:04.300]   Hot.
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:05.300]   Yes.
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:09.420]   Facebook blows me away because the scale of Facebook is mind-boggling.
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:15.040]   Facebook is the point where they're building data warehouses for images that are not accessed
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:16.260]   on a regular basis.
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:21.900]   They actually archive that data on servers that are powered down in new warehouses they've
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:22.900]   built.
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:27.480]   So if you go to a photo book from two years ago and there's a half-second delay in the
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:31.400]   photo, it's causing a lot of pressure because they're literally pulling it off of the lowest
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:33.600]   power storage they can dump it off.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.600]   It's amazing.
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.600]   It is amazing.
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:36.600]   It is amazing.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.240]   Because their energy bills are outrageous.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.960]   Well, we'll talk about that because Google now says that everything they do is solar, but
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:43.960]   we'll get to that.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:44.960]   Let's get back to this story.
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:48.360]   So 350 million photos a day go to Facebook.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:52.880]   Laxman Mutia, who is a security researcher, here's his post on Facebook.
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.180]   OMG.
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:56.500]   The album got deleted.
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:59.660]   So I got the key to delete all of your Facebook photos.
[01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:00.660]   LOL.
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:05.700]   Various emoticons immediately reported this bug to Facebook security team.
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:08.020]   Good on you, Laxman.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:11.580]   They were too fast in identifying this issue and there was a fix in place in less than
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:14.340]   two hours from the acknowledgement of the report.
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:15.780]   That is impressive.
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:16.780]   He did get paid.
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:20.940]   If he wanted to delete them all, though, he couldn't just push a button.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:23.640]   He would have to go individually to everybody's account.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.280]   Well, he could write a script.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.760]   He could distribute it.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:32.720]   Nowadays, it's pretty easy to use flaws in the time server, the NNTP time server or other
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.600]   things to magnify attacks.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.480]   I bet there's ways he could have weaponized this.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:40.080]   Well, especially if he's a gal founded, usually these guys.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:45.680]   Well, the truth is he probably could have gotten a million dollars from some shady organization
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.360]   to sell him the bug.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.620]   He said he got $12,500 as a bounty from Facebook.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:52.620]   That's reasonable.
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:55.220]   He's happy.
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:57.220]   He's my new hero.
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:59.860]   Is that a standard thing if you find a bug Facebook?
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:00.860]   Yeah.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:02.260]   In fact, a lot of companies do that.
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:04.660]   They have bounties.
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:09.020]   This is the article from Sophos' Naked Security blog, which, by the way, is one of the best.
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:11.180]   I really enjoy reading it.
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:13.620]   Yeah, Naked Security, isn't it?
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:16.100]   So thank you, Laxman, for not destroying.
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:20.200]   Imagine the damage he could have done if he just went through and destroyed all the...
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.280]   Well, they must have backups.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.280]   They could have...
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:24.280]   Oh, no.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:25.280]   I don't think Facebook backs up.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.280]   I don't know.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:27.280]   You're looking up at it.
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.280]   I don't know.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.280]   I don't know.
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.000]   What kind of an operation is this?
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.160]   You're going to back up 350 million photos a day?
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.160]   350 million a day?
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.320]   That would be a great conversation with somebody from Facebook to have.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:40.560]   Well, they have to back this.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:41.560]   They have to.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:47.020]   Probably, they have a way of kind of mirroring it, right?
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.940]   So when you upload a photo, they put it on two different servers and two different levels.
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:53.140]   You know, if your little Amazon thing was here, you could ask it, "How does Facebook back
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:54.420]   up all of its photos?"
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:55.900]   Oh!
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:59.540]   I have no idea, but you sure are handsome today.
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:01.900]   Thank you, Alexa.
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:07.660]   Facebook now has a new feature that you might like, as long as we're talking about Facebook.
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:10.100]   You can designate an heir to your digital...
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:11.540]   Yeah, I've heard about this.
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:12.540]   Yeah.
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:13.540]   I'm glad I'm not a member.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.540]   No, no.
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:15.540]   Oh, you don't have an account?
[01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:16.540]   No.
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:19.800]   You should set up a account so you can give it to your kids.
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:28.160]   Social network will let you designate a quote "legacy contact" for when you pass away.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.620]   This is being implemented now.
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:33.360]   I think this is a big issue going bigger all the time, right?
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:34.360]   I think so.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:35.360]   When you have...
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:36.360]   What does Facebook have?
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:37.360]   A billion and a half users?
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.280]   There's probably thousands of people die every day, honestly.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.480]   It's probably because they're on Facebook too much.
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.160]   Just dying on this...
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:47.160]   Boom!
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:48.160]   Headplant.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.160]   Google started this a couple of years ago.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:53.760]   You can actually designate a digital heir for Gmail, cloud storage.
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:56.960]   The digital heirs are called inactive account managers.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:58.960]   Yes, Leo's inactive.
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:50:59.960]   Dead.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.960]   At least he hasn't moved in days.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.520]   He could be alive.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:09.400]   I'm always getting invited in LinkedIn to dead people.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.400]   Oh!
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.560]   How does that happen?
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.720]   You know, they said, "Oh, people you might know."
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:16.720]   And they're fast away.
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:18.240]   Yeah, it's all I mean.
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:19.520]   Nobody deletes their account.
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:20.520]   It's still there.
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:21.520]   Well, you're dead.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:22.960]   How are you going to delete your account?
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:24.960]   Well, you need a legacy manager.
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.640]   Yeah, for LinkedIn, LinkedIn has fallen behind.
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:35.960]   So if you do nothing, when Facebook finds out that you've died, they don't find out
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:36.960]   they don't care.
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:37.960]   You've been inactive for three weeks.
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:38.960]   Are you still alive?
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:39.960]   Hello.
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:40.960]   It would take you as your account.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:41.960]   They were scared.
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:43.440]   I assumed I was dead a long time ago.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.440]   Here's what will happen.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.440]   It'll freeze your account.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:49.400]   Actually, usually this happens because the next of Ken says, "Leo's gone."
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:53.200]   They will freeze your account, leave posts and pictures at the privacy settings you were
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:55.520]   determined before you passed away.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:56.880]   They call it memorialization.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:02.080]   And then in most cases, people continue to post on your timeline, but it usually it's
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.840]   memorials to you.
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:09.800]   Not things like, "Hey, Leo, you want to go party?"
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:14.800]   No advertisements, by the way, on memorialized accounts because that would be a bad day.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.800]   You don't want to say a casket at it.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.800]   A casket at it.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:18.800]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:23.120]   Yeah, we can grind you up and throw you in the ocean.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:25.400]   Do you know Dan Lyons, Philip?
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:26.400]   You must know Dan.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.680]   I've met him a couple times.
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:29.680]   Yeah, I've met him.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.960]   I like the guy.
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:36.360]   He was six weeks ago, he was chosen to become the editor in chief of Gawker.
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.360]   He just quit.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:40.880]   He was taking that to nothing but grief.
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:43.680]   He was so funny as fake Steve Jobs.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.040]   He was fake Steve Jobs, right?
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:50.160]   Yeah, and then he was so terrible at Newsweek as a writing straight.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:56.680]   And he used to say, "I was in real life, I was never as funny as I was as fake Steve
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:57.680]   Jobs."
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:59.800]   And his career has been downhill ever since.
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:02.040]   It's too bad to have success early.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:05.400]   Actually, it's bad to have success anytime.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:08.920]   Because then you'll never, well, you should die after you get successful so that you
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:09.920]   don't have to live up.
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:10.920]   You're very successful.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.280]   You're running one of the top podcasting networks in the world.
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:14.560]   I love you, John.
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:15.760]   It's a fact.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:17.920]   I love you so much.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:21.520]   So he just, he quit from Gawker?
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.800]   Yeah, apparently he's got a bad back.
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:25.200]   You got a bad back.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.960]   What's that got to do with it?
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.400]   He wrote a post.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:32.760]   He said, "I got a bad back and I got a book deal."
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:34.600]   So yeah, I got the book deal.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.600]   I liked Dan a lot.
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:39.040]   Who's the new Gawker?
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:42.040]   Nobody's been tapped to run Gawker yet.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:44.680]   Well, this isn't Gawker so much as ValleyWag, I thought.
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:45.680]   No, it's Gawker.
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:46.680]   No, it's Gawker.
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:47.680]   No, no, no, he was doing it.
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:48.680]   Patrick's right.
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:49.680]   No, you're right.
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:51.520]   I think it was mostly ValleyWag stuff.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:54.680]   Yeah, because ValleyWag is his history of just destroying people.
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:55.680]   Yeah, coming from the world.
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:56.680]   And then they leave it up.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:57.680]   You're right.
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:58.680]   It was ValleyWag.
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:53:59.680]   I thought it was all of Gawker.
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:00.680]   So it's not--
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:01.680]   No, no, just mostly ValleyWag.
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:05.320]   He was the only guy posting on ValleyWag over the past, I don't know, months ago.
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:07.480]   That's kind of a ValleyWag tradition is having one person.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.200]   That would give me a bad back, Frank.
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.400]   Yeah, so he's writing and writing and writing and nothing but splattering.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:14.760]   Bad news, he writes, "I've been missing in action this week as I've been stuck in bed,
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:18.920]   heavily doped up and suffering with two things, the recurrence of an old back injury.
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:21.000]   Oh, and he got the flu."
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000]   So that's another reason.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.720]   Well, I don't think having the flu is the reason to quit.
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:25.720]   Dan, I--
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:26.720]   Oh, I got the flu I quit.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:28.320]   We've been trying to get Dan on the Twitter.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:29.840]   We'll get him on.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.120]   I hope now that he's got a book.
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:33.720]   This book is called Disrupted.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.200]   I don't know what it's about, but probably--
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.200]   It's about the flu.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.600]   Anyway, I loved it.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:44.320]   But ValleyWag is a tough gig because to do it right, you really have to skewer all your
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:45.320]   friends.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:46.840]   And then you don't have any friends left.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:48.840]   So Owen Thomas did it for a long time.
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:49.840]   Yeah, Thomas did.
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.920]   Well, I think Sam Bill was good at it.
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:52.920]   Sam was the greatest.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:53.920]   Did he retire what happened to Sam?
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.920]   I don't know.
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.640]   He's-- I asked him a send him a mail.
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:57.640]   Email.
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:58.800]   And he never replied.
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:54:59.800]   So I don't know what he's doing.
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:02.960]   He's still sharing posts anyway.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:05.040]   So here's a post from him.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:08.560]   The lesbian Jewish leftist conspiracy tearing red it apart.
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:10.360]   Yeah, that would be-- that's Sam Biddle?
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:11.360]   That's Sam Biddle?
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.920]   Yeah, that's him.
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:15.920]   So he's a basher.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:16.920]   It's great.
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:17.920]   This is very interesting.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.560]   I think it's-- I admit it.
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.360]   And in fact, that's what Dan said on his departure post is like the spot.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:25.880]   Like, remember that a British magazine spy?
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:29.280]   It wasn't an I-spy or something like that.
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:34.200]   It's that-- it's that, in fact, of course, it is a British inspired because the founder
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:38.360]   of Gawker, whose name is escaping me at the moment--
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:39.360]   Nick Denton.
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:40.360]   Nick Denton is British and--
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:41.360]   How the right.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:46.720]   --has that kind of standard for journalism.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:51.440]   Speaking of passing away, actually, this is a much more serious kind of shockingly.
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:54.640]   David Carr, who was really fantastic.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:56.200]   He was a great guy.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.360]   He was a media reporter at the New York Times.
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:06.600]   He did an event with-- about Laura Partrus' new documentary about Edward Snowden, which
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:12.560]   that featured a Partrus, Glenn Greenwater, and Snowden via Skype, went back to the Times
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:14.920]   newsroom and died.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:16.600]   58 years old.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:24.040]   But I swear to God, this guy was a huge influence on new media, on everything going on in the
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.040]   tech world.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.040]   Really great.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:35.080]   Well, he famously was a crackhead who left his daughters in a car while he went in to
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.400]   see his crack dealer, and there was a gun.
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:38.920]   I figured-- he wrote a book about it.
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:39.920]   This is a gun.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:40.920]   You're not revealing anything nobody knows.
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:41.920]   This is a very--
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:43.440]   No, no, in fact, an amazing story.
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:51.000]   Yeah, and he says he had an inbred allergy to beverage alcohol.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.800]   If he had one drink, he would be burning coke the next day.
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:59.840]   And it was partly because he was so honest about that.
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:04.040]   He was brutally honest about everything, most of all himself.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:07.120]   And he was just wonderful on the media.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:11.120]   Yeah, I read him religiously.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:14.960]   The Night of the Gun was the book that he wrote in 2008 about his addiction to crack.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:17.600]   He had twin daughters.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:20.960]   One night shortly after the girls were born, he left them in a car while he went.
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.560]   He went to score some coke from a dealer named Kenny.
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:32.880]   Anyway, there is a great documentary about the times called Page One was made three or
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:36.040]   four years ago in which he features prominently.
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.320]   And so if you want to know more about David Carr and how much he will be missed, that's
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:46.080]   a great place to start.
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.160]   He and I were born the same day.
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.160]   No kidding.
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.160]   September, 1956.
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:52.520]   Well, he was born a few years ago.
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:54.760]   So we're the same age to I was born November in 1950.
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:57.760]   No, he was born years before me, but the same birthday.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:58.760]   Okay.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.320]   He's much, much older than you.
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:01.320]   Much younger.
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:02.320]   Okay.
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:03.320]   And he's in.
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:06.120]   He's born years before you.
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:07.400]   Unless my math is off.
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:10.600]   No, no, I know you were.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.200]   Okay.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:14.200]   Wow.
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:19.160]   $1.6 billion.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:22.040]   That's what Expedia paid for orbits.
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:24.200]   There now are only two.
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:26.240]   This is happening to the real estate sites too.
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:29.080]   How do I get rid of this ad?
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.520]   No, sign up about travel data.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:33.520]   Top left.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:34.520]   Wow.
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:37.600]   That was annoying.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:41.520]   People often ask me, why don't you run an ad blocker when you pull up these websites?
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:43.320]   Because I don't want you to block our ads.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:45.920]   So be kind of rude and maybe a little bit of a critic.
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:48.440]   I use an ad blocker and ad nauseam.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:49.440]   You know about this?
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.440]   What's ad nauseam?
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:52.280]   Ad nauseam is the greatest.
[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:53.440]   That's really a product?
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:54.440]   Yes.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.920]   It's you finding on a source.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:57.640]   From the bad who gets no spam.
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:59.600]   Now the bad who gets no ads.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:01.080]   No, I see that even though.
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:05.400]   You block the ads, you use adblock and you have to use adblock to use ad nauseam.
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:11.240]   Ad nauseam goes into the background and clicks on every ad in the background to completely
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:16.080]   screw up all these algorithms that try to sell you stuff.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:18.160]   Clicking on ads so you don't have to.
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.160]   Yeah.
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:20.640]   Oh, this is evil.
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:21.640]   Totally.
[01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:24.080]   It's great.
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:29.200]   You only say that, John, because no agenda is supported by its listeners, not by advertising.
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:30.800]   That's not the reason I say it.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:31.800]   Oh.
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:36.080]   It's because I mean, I appreciate the differences between an advertiser and listener supported.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:40.760]   But bugs me is all this clicking and tracking you.
[01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:44.840]   And so every time they're trying to out guess you and serve you certain kinds of ads and
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:46.360]   all this, this is nonsense.
[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:47.360]   It doesn't work anyway.
[01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:49.280]   So let's just foil them with that.
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:50.280]   Screw with them.
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:51.520]   Yeah, screw with them.
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.520]   Wow.
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:53.520]   All right.
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.520]   Well, there you go.
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:55.520]   A little plug for ad nauseam.
[01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:56.520]   It doesn't.
[01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:58.080]   But there is a serious point here.
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:04.680]   It does feel like, I mean, people don't look at ads on mobile.
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:09.160]   But yeah, whole businesses have been built on them.
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:10.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:12.600]   And it just feels like something's going to collapse.
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:13.600]   Yeah, it does.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.400]   Actually Adam, I have to say it was brilliant.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:20.360]   The last time he was on Twitter discussing this whole issue, he talked about banner ads.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:25.240]   He said, the fundamental issue with ads, banner ads, is there's no scarcity.
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:26.800]   It's an infinite resource.
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:31.320]   And so it has zero value because of course, when there's no scarcity, they're the value
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:32.320]   plummets.
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:33.320]   Right.
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:34.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:35.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:37.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:38.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:40.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:41.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:42.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:43.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:44.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:45.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:46.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:48.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:49.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:50.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:51.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:52.320]   And so it's a very important thing.

[02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:58.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:00:59.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:00.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:01.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:02.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:04.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.320]   And so it's a very important thing.

[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:12.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:13.320]   And so it's a very important thing.

[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:18.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:20.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.320]   And so it's a very important thing.

[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:34.320]   And so it's a very important thing.
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:39.320]   And then orbits was created initially by the airlines, wasn't it?
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:40.320]   I think that was the idea.
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.320]   There was a consortium of a few different airlines
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.320]   that created orbits.
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:46.320]   I don't know who owns orbits as it's being sold.
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:49.320]   This is going to consolidate just the way the real estate stuff's going to go.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.320]   By the way, if you see that creepy, creepy ad for Trivago,
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:57.320]   with the guy who's got like, have you seen that ad?
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:58.320]   Who is that guy?
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:59.320]   Run it.
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:00.320]   Can you find it?
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:01.320]   Yeah, I can.
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:02.320]   It's the internet.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:03.320]   I can find anything.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:06.320]   Trivago has the weirdest ads.
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.320]   By the way, that's owned by Expedia.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.320]   So don't think like you're getting away from Expedia by using the Trivago.
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:14.320]   This guy.
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:17.320]   Did you notice that there's so many prices out there for the exact thing?
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:18.320]   He hasn't shaved.
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.320]   Trivago does the work for you and instantly compares prices.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:22.320]   Who is this?
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.320]   Who is this?
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:24.320]   Trying to appeal to?
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.320]   What's wrong with that shaving?
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:26.320]   No, you look good.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:27.320]   I'm just saying.
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:28.320]   This appeal is the Norton.
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:30.320]   You find the ideal hotel.
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:32.320]   Why is he tugged like this?
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:35.320]   It feels like a stoner dude you met on the street.
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:39.320]   And it could just like Don Johnson with a volume turned down.
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.320]   It's very strange.
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:41.320]   I agree.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.320]   It's a weird guy.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.320]   Weird casting.
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.320]   You agree?
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:45.320]   Yeah.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:46.320]   It's a weird guy.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:48.320]   Let's get your attention and we're running an ad.
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:51.320]   You're not the guy from Lost by the Co.
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:54.320]   So he's the guy who's saying it's a weird guy.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:59.320]   Anyway, that's just Expedia with a different name.
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.320]   I was wondering like, where do these guys come from?
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:02.320]   I'm not going to say Expedia.
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:03.320]   Yeah, you just change your name and--
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:04.320]   Change your name and people go like this?
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:05.320]   Yeah, I'll never use Expedia.
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:06.320]   I hate Expedia.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.320]   I mean, that makes sense.
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:08.320]   I mean, you--
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:09.320]   Priceline owns Open Table.
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:11.320]   Did you know that?
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:14.320]   They own Kayak?
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:15.320]   Mm.
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:17.320]   Oh, groans from the audience.
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:18.320]   What?
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.320]   No?
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:20.320]   Okay.
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.320]   I love Kayak.
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:23.320]   I didn't realize they were owned by anybody.
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:27.320]   I think that's what people were upset about.
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:30.320]   TripAdvisor is another one that has a lot of-- who owns hotels.com?
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.320]   Except that must be Priceline, right?
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:33.320]   That feels like a Priceline.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.320]   Not so you know, hotels.com on the giant list.
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:36.320]   Not on the list.
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:37.320]   Could be.
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:38.320]   Not on the list.
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:39.320]   Maybe there is somebody.
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:43.320]   Who owns Aviato?
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.320]   Nobody got that.
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:45.320]   You got that.
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:46.320]   I didn't get it.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:47.320]   Explain.
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:51.320]   It's a TV thing you just would understand.
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:52.320]   Oh.
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:53.320]   A TV?
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:55.320]   What do you think of Jet.com?
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:56.320]   About to launch.
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:59.320]   They're going out of their private beta to a less private beta.
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:01.320]   Right now.
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:05.320]   Hotels.com became a part of Expedia Incorporated in 2001.
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:06.320]   What?
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:09.320]   Yeah, you can go to the hotel reservations network.
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.320]   Became a part of Expedia Incorporated in 2001 and in 2002,
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:14.320]   changed to Sam to Hotels.com.
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:19.320]   So the guy who created, was at Qadisi, they were diapers.com.
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:20.320]   Diapers.com.
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:25.320]   He built up a big business and then Amazon went, oh, look, somebody's selling diapers and they bought them.
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:27.320]   For a lot of money, I think.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.320]   A lot of money in diapers.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:30.320]   A lot of money in diapers.
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:31.320]   Yeah.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:32.320]   He's a crappy business.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:33.320]   So he started a new business.
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:34.320]   It's called Jet.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:38.320]   You have five words out there before you go.
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:39.320]   That's good.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:42.320]   It's called Jet.com.
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:46.320]   The shopping club reinvented, they're going straight after Amazon, obviously.
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:49.320]   $50 a year instead of $99 for Amazon Prime.
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:53.320]   They will have some, how so good, three warehouses, but most of it,
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:59.320]   they're going to be a middleman for retailers and they'll just provide the interface to retailers.
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:01.320]   Good luck.
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:03.320]   They just raised, what was the story?
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:05.320]   They just raised some huge amount of money.
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:07.320]   Yeah, kiss a death.
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:10.320]   Yeah, I wouldn't want to raise a lot of money.
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:12.320]   There's $600 million.
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:13.320]   $600 million.
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:14.320]   $600 million.
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:18.320]   One of the things, how much of this, that's their valuation.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:22.320]   I wonder how much of this is people thinking, oh, well, Amazon will just buy them a Sizzo.
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:23.320]   It'd become successful.
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.320]   I'm sure there's that thought is in the area.
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:27.320]   Mark Lour, that was his name.
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.320]   He started the diapers site.
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:30.320]   I like the T-shirts.
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.320]   They're purple.
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:32.320]   Jet.
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.320]   It's $140 million in new clothes.
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:37.320]   That's more, Amazon never raised anything like that.
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:39.320]   I mean, this is big bucks.
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:42.320]   Google Ventures, Goldman Sachs.
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:46.320]   Amazon.com did this weird thing where they just started making money.
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:47.320]   Yeah, that makes it interesting.
[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:48.320]   They're re-insting it.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.320]   Well, they're selling a lot.
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:50.320]   I mean, it's kind of crazy.
[02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:51.320]   There's a lot of cash flow.
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.320]   They've started making money.
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:53.320]   Kind of crazy.
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:55.960]   Jet's not made any money yet.
[02:05:55.960 --> 02:05:58.800]   But they've gotten over $200 million in venture capital funds.
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:01.040]   You know who's got a lot of money?
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:02.040]   How much do you think?
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:03.840]   You just look at the headlines.
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:05.240]   It says right there.
[02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:07.400]   How much do you think Candy Crush made?
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:10.120]   Maybe that purchase is in 2014.
[02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:11.800]   I'm guessing about $1.3 billion.
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:14.880]   You would be right, sir.
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:17.080]   Holy come on.
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:21.080]   $1.3 billion in app purchases.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:24.400]   Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:27.320]   For color bombs and lollipop hammers.
[02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:28.320]   Yes.
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:34.800]   And it's still only the third highest grossing app in the United States.
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:36.040]   What's the highest two?
[02:06:36.040 --> 02:06:38.160]   I think Clash of Clans is number one.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:39.160]   So it's more.
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:41.160]   There'll be more than that amount of money.
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:46.000]   Candy Crush Sota Saga is sixth overall.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.880]   I still play Angry Birds.
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:49.160]   Angry Birds right in there.
[02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:52.680]   I never paid a nickel.
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:53.680]   You never paid a nickel.
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:56.960]   Yeah, no, you can actually-- some games, not all, but some--
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:58.840]   Candy Crush Saga, you have two choices.
[02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:02.880]   You can either annoy your friends on Facebook or pay money.
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:04.800]   I don't have Facebook friends.
[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:05.560]   I'm not--
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:06.720]   You don't have Facebook.
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:07.680]   So you can't even play.
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:08.720]   You're not allowed to play Candy Crush.
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:10.800]   I can't do anything, apparently, because every--
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:12.440]   You know what bugs me the most.
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:15.120]   But bugs me the most as you go onto some website.
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:17.000]   In fact, the USA Today's this way.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.720]   I would like to leave a comment.
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:20.920]   Please sign in with Facebook.
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:22.040]   I'm not a Facebook member.
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.720]   I want to leave a comment on USA Today.
[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:25.160]   But no, I have to sign in.
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:26.880]   Eventually, they're going to get you.
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:27.760]   No.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:30.040]   No, when they go to voting, you have to be Facebook
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:30.440]   to register.
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:30.960]   Oh.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:34.920]   That, what you said, is frighteningly close to the truth.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.280]   It's going to be Apple, because Apple went to meet--
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.760]   Well, I'll sign up for Apple.
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:41.360]   But not Facebook.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:42.200]   Wow.
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:43.480]   You're pretty adamant about that.
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:43.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:44.600]   I'm getting more--
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:46.640]   Why don't you just create a phony account of Facebook
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:47.200]   and just use that--
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.120]   I've thought about that.
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:49.560]   Don't put anything real in there.
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.080]   Nah.
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:51.720]   Do you have ad nauseam for Facebook,
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:52.760]   where you put a lot of-- you just--
[02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:53.520]   You put a bunch of--
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:54.000]   You game them.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.200]   You game them.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.720]   Nah.
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:58.640]   For one thing, I think in the terms of services
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:07:59.760]   you can't do that.
[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:01.600]   And I only obey terms of services.
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:02.520]   I know you're so serious.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:04.000]   I'm all in.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.520]   I do not want to end this show.
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:08.960]   I'm having way too much fun.
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.720]   But I suppose we have to.
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:12.120]   Drone rules?
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:13.400]   Should we end with that?
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:14.360]   Or do you care?
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.520]   I'm excited about, actually, somebody--
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:19.320]   FAA has proposed rules--
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:21.600]   This is because of you.
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:22.800]   No.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:24.880]   No, because it's only for commercial use.
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:26.760]   For non-commercial use, there's still no rules.
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:30.240]   And I would point out that the FAA has no enforcement arm
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:31.520]   whatsoever.
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:34.320]   So they can say whatever they want.
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:36.520]   It's not what are they going to do.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.040]   And these are proposed rules.
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:42.120]   They say we're going to ask for 60 days of comment.
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:44.720]   And then it's going to take as much as a year and a half
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:47.240]   to figure out what all those comments mean.
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:48.720]   And then we'll decide whether these are--
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:51.280]   Well, I mean, that's kind of a standard pace for something
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:53.360]   like this, where requests for comments--
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:54.200]   Two years?
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:55.720]   And that sounds right.
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:58.600]   Because the whole scene could change in two years.
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:02.680]   So 50 drones, they're 55 pounds or lower.
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:05.920]   It has to be-- the big thing that's got people up in arms
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:07.520]   is it has to be line of sight.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:08.520]   You cannot fly it somewhere.
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:09.280]   You can't see it.
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:09.760]   Yeah.
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:12.320]   And only during daytime hours, no more night flights.
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:15.320]   And that's kind of--
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:16.320]   And--
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.320]   Chris Anderson's operation.
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.320]   I wonder if that-- what he thinks of this, because he has,
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:21.320]   you know, at his drone companies all about, you know,
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:22.320]   they've got former--
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:22.320]   Yeah.
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:23.320]   --air wired.
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:23.320]   Yeah.
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:25.320]   He's got a drone that you program with an iPad,
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:27.320]   and you tell you where you want it to go,
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:29.320]   and it goes around and takes a bunch of pictures and then comes
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:30.320]   back home on its own.
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:31.320]   You push the button off the goes.
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:32.320]   Line of sight is over.
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:35.320]   Well, commercial, you can do whatever you want.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.320]   Yeah.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:38.320]   I mean, it's interesting that they're basically leaving it
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:40.320]   as a free for all for non-commercial operation.
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:41.320]   Right.
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:42.320]   Right.
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:45.320]   They're considering creating a separate category for very
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:49.320]   small drones under 4.4 pounds that will allow operators to fly
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:51.320]   over people.
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:53.320]   You can't fly over people.
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:54.320]   Well, that's--
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:55.320]   Do you all have--
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:56.320]   Do you all have--
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:58.320]   Don't you?
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.320]   No, and I want one for Christmas.
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:01.320]   OK, I'll just--
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:02.320]   Yeah, I'll go.
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:03.320]   How about one tomorrow?
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:06.320]   Yeah, go to Amazon, get a Hubson X4, and get the 5-pack
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:07.320]   of energy batteries.
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:08.320]   Hubson's got one of those.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:10.320]   And they sell a little propeller guard, and then just
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:11.320]   start with that.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:12.320]   Or a SEMA.
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:13.320]   That's why I'm a--
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:14.320]   How much does that cost?
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.320]   40 bucks.
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:19.320]   Yeah, I think I'm all in for $80 with like five batteries and
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:20.320]   a spare charger.
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:21.320]   I'm not a dude that.
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:23.320]   You'll want to buy extra batteries, because as soon as you
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:25.320]   start flying it, you'll be like, seven minutes, and then I'm
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:26.320]   going to go recharge it.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:28.320]   So what you do is you get an inexpensive one that you can
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.320]   beat the snot out of.
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.320]   Right.
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:32.320]   You know, you get an extra--
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.320]   Or lose the first time you fly it, because it goes straight up
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:35.320]   and never comes down.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:37.320]   You might want to start flying inside your house for just
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:38.320]   that reason.
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:40.320]   That's stick on the ceiling.
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:43.320]   Amazon Prime, however, is still grounded.
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:46.320]   The FAA has not approved commercial delivery services.
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:47.320]   Good.
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.320]   Under the rules, it's almost impossible to operate delivery
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:52.320]   drones.
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:53.320]   Good.
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:54.320]   That's OK.
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:56.320]   Because all I could think of as soon as I saw that video is
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:00.320]   like, how many people are going to be stealing Amazon drones?
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:05.320]   Somebody has to invent a non-lethal drone shotgun.
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:06.320]   Why?
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:07.320]   So you can take them out of the sky.
[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:09.320]   Yeah, you want to take these things down.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:11.320]   Like rubber bullet for drone guns.
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:13.320]   I think it should shoot a net.
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:14.320]   Oh, a drone net.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:15.320]   Like Batman.
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:16.320]   Yeah.
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:17.320]   And then you bring them down.
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:20.320]   And then you could control it with your own controller if you
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:21.320]   stole theirs.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:24.320]   That's actually the HAC-5 crew did a pretty funny one with the
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:28.320]   parent AR, where they basically flew their drone over it,
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.320]   and it basically took over the Wi-Fi controls.
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:32.320]   Oh.
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:33.320]   That's a good idea.
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.320]   They can either fly away with it or drop it out of the sky.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:36.320]   It's like a tractor beam.
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:38.320]   It's just a trick and take it with it.
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:39.320]   James Bond movie.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:42.320]   I think it comes down with some suction cups and it's in there.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.320]   I love that.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.320]   With more.
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:46.320]   Am I?
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:48.320]   OK, am I being hysterical when I'm saying I'm worried about the
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:50.320]   proliferation of drones?
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:52.320]   I feel like there's going to be a lot of drones.
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:54.320]   Like, just me drones everywhere.
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:57.320]   And they're going to be coming out far in the sky like snow.
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:11:59.320]   And they're going to be clocking me in the head.
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:00.320]   I'm going to have to wear a helmet.
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:02.320]   Well, the thing is like, it's not going to be like CB radio,
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:05.320]   because generally speaking, CB radios were not flown over
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:06.320]   your backyard.
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:07.320]   Well, but it was going to be popular.
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:10.320]   I'm talking about the popularity, not the model.
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:11.320]   They won't work like CB radio.
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:15.320]   And by the way, I do want to-- I think the idea of getting really good at these drones,
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:19.320]   and then when somebody's walking down the sidewalk by your house,
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:22.320]   just sending the drone out and just having a buzzing around behind them,
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:24.320]   it doesn't even be kind of funny.
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:27.320]   It would be kind of funny, but it's also--
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:29.320]   So Chris, are you worried or not worried?
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:32.320]   He's 17, so he's a young person.
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.320]   Yeah, he's already followed people around with his drone.
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.320]   You follow people around with your drone?
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:36.320]   I was saying, because I've done that.
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.320]   Yeah.
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:40.320]   You see people walking their dogs and you fly it up right behind them.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:41.320]   He's the problem.
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:45.320]   And you start forcing people to want to regulate drones.
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:47.320]   Well, that don't do it.
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:48.320]   Yeah.
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:49.320]   Oh, is that your goal?
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:52.320]   I think you get a little speaker on the phone and then--
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:56.320]   I'm going to show you my reason for wanting to regulate drones
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:58.320]   after this commercial from insurance.
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:03.320]   I don't mind my commercials, but please, do I have to have commercials on YouTube really?
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:04.320]   Can't you speed it up?
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:05.320]   No, you can't.
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:06.320]   You can't skip it.
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:08.320]   Just enjoy the commerce joke.
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:09.320]   This is why I believed--
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:10.320]   Oh, there you go.
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:11.320]   This is why I believed--
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:12.320]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:13.320]   We've been regulating it.
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.320]   We showed this before on Twitter, but I can't resist it.
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:17.320]   You hit the guy right in the head.
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:18.320]   It's his brother.
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:21.320]   He gave his brother a football helmet and said, "Look, you stand out in the field.
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:23.320]   We're going to put rowing candles on this drone."
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:24.320]   This is going to be my son's view.
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:26.320]   This is totally going to be my son's in like 10 years.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:27.320]   This is what boys do.
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:28.320]   Yeah.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.320]   Watch.
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:30.320]   We get the video from his point of view.
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:31.320]   You see the forest fire.
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:32.320]   This is where the--
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:33.320]   Where the--
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:34.320]   Where the--
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:36.320]   So here's the question.
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.320]   What incident will it be that causes such an outrage that these things get out of?
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:43.960]   Got a drunk guy flying a drone over the White House.
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:44.960]   That didn't cause--
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:45.960]   I mean--
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:46.960]   He was a surprise.
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:47.960]   Was he drunk?
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:50.120]   Yeah, he was two in the morning.
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:51.760]   He was a federal employee, by the way.
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:52.760]   I run a contractor.
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:14:00.520]   A contractor for a federal agency which shares geolocation information with other spy agencies.
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.520]   And he-- I guess it's two in the morning just kind of got a--
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:07.240]   Well, I guess he's like drunk in his buddy's house and decides to see if he can fly the
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:11.520]   drone over to take a picture of the White House and hits a tree.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:12.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:13.520]   Still a Tony.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:14.520]   And that didn't do it.
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:15.520]   I think you know what will happen.
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:16.520]   It's going to be a major--
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:17.520]   Well, he's not freaked out.
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:18.520]   They're like, we've--
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:19.520]   Yeah.
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:20.520]   You no longer use GPS in positioning over--
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:21.520]   Well--
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:24.520]   It's like, OK, so what about the billion drones that don't require--
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:26.480]   And that's from where that would keep you from doing that.
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.520]   And then they pulled back because I guess it broke the drone or something.
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:33.520]   But they had a firmware update that wouldn't let you fly a drone in downtown DC.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:37.520]   But then I've been told by the chalom they pulled it back.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.520]   I think what's going to happen, I believe, is somebody's going to weaponize a drone and
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:44.520]   use it during a major sporting event.
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:46.520]   These kids already did that, didn't you see that video?
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:47.520]   Something like that.
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:51.880]   But instead of shooting at their brother, they flew it over the Super Bowl.
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:53.360]   That's going to be a big cure.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:55.520]   And that's going to happen, don't you think?
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:56.520]   You know, it's--
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:59.280]   With all due respect, if somebody's going to blow up the Super Bowl, they're going to
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:00.280]   do it however they're going to do it.
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:01.280]   They're going to bring it in--
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:02.280]   Oh, but all right.
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:03.280]   And I don't--
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:04.280]   They're going to bring it in the people, they're going to bring it in a backpack, they're going
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:05.280]   to put it in a belt--
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:06.280]   Yeah, there's lots of ways to do it.
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.280]   Maybe they can do it at this new stadium that they're having it at next year.
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:09.280]   That would be a plus.
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:12.280]   You mean the one in Santa Clara that the 49ers just built?
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:14.280]   Yeah, the one they can't win in?
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:15.280]   That one?
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:16.280]   That one?
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:18.280]   Black Sunday, that's right.
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:20.280]   Or what was the movie-- was it Batman?
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:24.280]   Yeah, the last Batman movie where they're playing a football game in the whole field collapses
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:28.280]   because Bane somehow has figured out how to change how the world-- the earth works.
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:29.280]   Yeah, you changed physics.
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:31.280]   So I figured out-- Fantastic.
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:34.280]   How to undermine an entire football field with--
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:37.280]   Well, I mean Black Sunday was somebody talking about--
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:38.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:39.280]   --on Boone.
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:40.280]   Kill it, kill the pox.
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:42.280]   All right, we're done.
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:44.280]   This should have-- I knew I should have ended this before that story.
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:46.280]   You got to leave him wanting more.
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:49.280]   Phillip, Elmer DeWitt, I think you're the greatest.
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:51.280]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:52.280]   Oh.
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:55.280]   One of the Elders statesmen, I hope you don't take that wrong of tech journalism.
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:57.280]   You've been around for a long time.
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:01.280]   And you're almost as old as Devorak.
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:02.280]   Hey.
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:03.280]   Hey.
[02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:04.280]   I'm 65.
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:05.280]   How old are you?
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:06.280]   I don't know.
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:07.280]   He doesn't talk about it.
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:09.280]   Old enough to know better.
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:14.280]   Yeah, he's-- he and I are of similar age.
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:16.280]   But it's great to have you.
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:17.280]   Thank you, Phillip.
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:18.280]   You can catch his stuff in Fortune.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:20.280]   And he wanted to give out his email address.
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:22.280]   That's something people don't usually do on this show.
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:24.280]   P-E-D at Mac.com.
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:27.280]   I hope you've got your filters loaded.
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:30.280]   Dinner is almost ready, so you better wrap this up.
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:31.280]   We're done.
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:32.280]   Goodbye.
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:33.280]   Have dinner.
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:34.280]   What's-- but wait a minute.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:35.280]   But wait.
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:36.280]   What's before dinner?
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:38.280]   Margo, what's for dinner?
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:40.280]   Because I'm kind of hungry.
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:41.280]   I'm a little pecky.
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:42.280]   Ravioli.
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:43.280]   Whoa, my favorite.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.280]   I'll be right there.
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:48.280]   Have you gone up to the Occidental Hotel in those raviolis?
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:49.280]   No.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:50.280]   Are they good?
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:51.280]   Have you ever been to the Occidental?
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:52.280]   Yeah.
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:53.280]   No, really?
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:54.280]   No.
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:56.280]   Occidental Hotel, Ravioli, are really good.
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:59.280]   Well, you can actually buy them to go, and that's what you want.
[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:00.280]   They're like, you know, a mole in an hour.
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.280]   The Biggerian freeze stone.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:02.280]   They're really outstanding.
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:03.280]   They're delicious.
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:05.280]   I do love that bakery in Freestone.
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:07.280]   Those cinnamon buns, that'll kill you.
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:10.280]   That thing says it big as your head.
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:11.280]   Yeah, wildflower bread.
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:12.280]   Wildflower.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:13.280]   So good.
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:15.280]   All right, I'm sorry.
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:17.280]   You were saying noagendashow.com.
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:19.280]   John de Vork, thanks for being here.
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:20.280]   You're a fantastic guest.
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:21.280]   Exactly.
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:22.280]   Yeah.
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:24.280]   I'm always a pleasure.
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:25.280]   I miss you.
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:27.280]   You should come by more often.
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:28.280]   I'm sorry I touched you.
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:30.280]   I lost my head.
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:34.280]   You may keep the 75 millimeter for a little while longer.
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:35.280]   Not forever.
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:36.280]   Whenever you want to back it's yours.
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:37.280]   But it is a great lens.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:38.280]   It is a great lens, I agree.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:40.280]   And you have the little pen camera.
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:41.280]   It probably looks funny on that little camera.
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:42.280]   It does.
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:43.280]   I know it's huge.
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:44.280]   I actually have some big giant lenses I put on this thing.
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:45.280]   So the camera's a little bit easier.
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:47.280]   It looks like he's using a lens, not a camera.
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:48.280]   Shooting with a lens.
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:50.280]   Patrick Norton Tech Thang.
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:52.280]   Do that tech thang.
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:18:00.280]   T-E-K-T-H-I-N-G.com if you want to know more and contribute to their patreon and keep
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.280]   Patrick and diapers.
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:03.280]   Yes.
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:05.280]   No, all the kids are out of diapers.
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:07.280]   We're at the tail end of potty training.
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:08.280]   Oh, God.
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:09.280]   Yeah.
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:10.280]   That's the highlight.
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:13.880]   When you have a couple of kids, when they're both out of diapers, it's really nice.
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:16.280]   When they're both in diapers, not so good.
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:18.280]   We space them out.
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:21.120]   We got used to no diapers and sleeping through the night.
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:22.120]   It felt so good.
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:23.120]   We decided to have another kid.
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:24.120]   Yeah.
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:25.120]   Yeah.
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:26.120]   You've got to lose your mind, don't you?
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:27.120]   Ah.
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:28.120]   Thank you, Patrick.
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:29.120]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.

[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:51.400]   We have great apps.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:53.320]   Can't take credit for them.
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:56.480]   All designed by talented third-party developers.
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:00.920]   iOS, Android, even Windows Phone, Roku.
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:02.080]   You can watch on your big screen TV.
[02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:04.680]   If you want to be in the studio, we've got a great studio audience.
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:06.160]   Really nice to have you all.
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:07.640]   Just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:08.640]   We'll put out a chair for you.
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:12.440]   If you get here early, you get the comfortable chair.
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:13.600]   The rest of you, sorry.
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:16.320]   I don't know where we got those.
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:18.280]   Must be Costco or somewhere.
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:19.640]   Those are just not comfortable chairs.
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:20.640]   I apologize.
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:23.040]   Thanks for being here.
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:24.040]   We'll see you next time.
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:25.040]   Another Twit?
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:26.040]   Easy as you can.
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:27.040]   Yay!
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:28.040]   [applause]
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:29.040]   What a big, what a big audience.
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:30.040]   Do it a twit.
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:31.040]   All right.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:32.040]   Do it a twit, baby.
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:33.040]   Do it a twit.
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:34.040]   All right.
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:35.040]   Do it a twit, baby.
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:36.040]   Do it a twit.
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:37.040]   All right.
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:38.040]   Do it a twit, baby.
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:39.040]   Do it a twit.
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:40.040]   All right.
