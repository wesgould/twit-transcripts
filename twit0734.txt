[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.520]   news sometimes we have a show where we know that the hosts the co-hosts the
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.040]   people who join us in the show have such strong opinions are so engaged that we
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.880]   really need only a couple of them and this is one of those shows I am always
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.520]   thrilled to have these two on with me. Christina Warren film girl senior cloud
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.920]   advocate of Microsoft just the greatest hello Christina how are you? I'm good
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.200]   how are you? I am so glad to see you you're off your travels for the day for the
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.080]   week the month. Yes a little bit I will be in Portland just doing some personal
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.880]   travel next week but I don't have any international travel until November so
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.040]   I'm I've been enjoying basically like the summer off I did so much kind of
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.760]   around the world stuff the first half the year that it's been nice to to kind
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.480]   of be you know at home even though summer which is now over Labor Day but
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.160]   it's been nice to not have to go anywhere to be honest. You will see Christina a
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.600]   lot of Microsoft events all over the world and she'll be back a guess in
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.040]   November going all over the place so it's great to have you on also from the UK
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.160]   speaking all over the world joining us from the Packet Pushers Network our
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.200]   friend Greg Ferro hello Greg hello Leo hello Christina nice to see you both
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.160]   nice to see you haven't had a theory of mind on and sometimes so it's about time
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.120]   yeah it's been six months or so you know we've all been busy doing our thing
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.120]   haven't we? We have your Packet Pushers Network is a great place to go for
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.320]   people are interested in hardcore enterprise network computing really a
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.240]   great place to get that information. Thank you for having a lot of fun it's
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.400]   really going on long really well it's been going so well I kind of can't believe
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.320]   it really. I should just do enterprise stories today you guys she's focused on
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.080]   .NET actually Microsoft is gonna have a big event October 2nd you go to New
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.480]   York City for that or no? I'm not gonna be there for that one but I will be
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.120]   watching and like listening you know on wrapped like everybody else. Do you don't
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.240]   I should just get this out of the way if you knew anything you couldn't tell
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.600]   us. I knew anything I couldn't tell you but I genuinely don't know. You probably don't
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.360]   because this is the surface division most likely. Yeah this is the service
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.440]   division I don't know anything about this to be honest usually what happens
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.040]   is if I'm trying to find out what's what's going on I ask my friends in the tech
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.080]   press because I'm not gonna like like the internal people aren't gonna tell me
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.520]   which is completely fair so no I'm I'm just like anybody else watching from a
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.320]   far but I'm certainly excited because I'm a big fan of the the surface devices I
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.360]   got my husband a surface go last year. I love my surface go I would love to see
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.880]   it a little more juice in it but it's such a great little portable tablet it's
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.080]   about the size of an iPad but it's running when those 10 and it's just I
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.360]   love it that's my great little portable machine yeah I would like one a little
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.000]   more powerful to I would really love to see surface laptops with a Thunderbolt
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.160]   3 that would be like my kind of wish for well you know windows laptop so you
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.360]   may get your wish there are kind of some rumors that that may be something we'll
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.040]   see October 2nd the other thing people are expecting is a device that was
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.440]   shown around Microsoft a few months ago during internal meetings code named
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:20.880]   Scentaurus a dual screen laptop tablet hybrid I won't ask you Christina but I
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.280]   will ask Greg what do you ask her she's suddenly silent what do you think
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.120]   you really have no idea okay I'm not sure I think that I think the challenge
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.960]   here is can as somebody who's been using a desktop and a laptop for 20 plus years
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.040]   and I've sort of been I still very bitter about Microsoft after 20 years of
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   using the rubbish products like Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows I just
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.800]   don't believe that Microsoft will ever get these products right and they should
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.880]   all just be thrown in the bin and we should walk away and hope that something
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.960]   new emerges that actually works we have a dissenting view you know 20 years of
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.480]   Microsoft rubbish it's clearly you know it's interesting the hardware this kind
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.480]   of hardware anyways new I mean they've made mice and keyboards before they made
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:18.200]   a famously a DOS card for an Apple 2 but this is laptop computing and desktop
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.520]   computing is kind of new for Michael that you know I guess I guess the thing
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.000]   here is that Microsoft's bringing the bundle together Apple sort of proved the
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.320]   idea that if you make the hardware and the software and then your absolute and
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   the trick here is that Microsoft is now responsible for actually making it
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.080]   work they can't blame the computer maker or the BIOS they have to take
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.520]   responsibility for it and then what we're actually seeing in my opinion is
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.600]   Microsoft has to grow up and make these products actually work instead of just
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.240]   ship some trash but I do feel like Microsoft see I want to give them a
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.800]   pass because they're new to this business particularly the surface book the first
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.280]   surface book which I had a lot of trouble with for six months and I think was
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.960]   because it had a detachable screen that was had a GPU that was detachable which
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.440]   was kind of problematic for the operating system I felt like these were kind of
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.920]   newbie mistakes and I do feel like the surfaces have gotten better we had a
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.920]   studio for a long time a hundred billion dollar company that's had 30 years of
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.680]   experience of doing everything wrong they never get it right and yet we always
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.080]   sit there and say oh we'll give them a gun other guys but no way to cut that was
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.980]   as faulty as Microsoft Windows is you'd set the bloody thing on fire and send it
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.160]   back right but there's no evidence that Microsoft in the way to help me I'm in
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:36.200]   trouble they are starting to ignore the things they're bad at and pay much more
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.320]   attention to the things that they're really really good at like enterprise
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.280]   software there you go software there you go really really good at the
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.640]   enterprise much so you just made my case the company they are not so good at
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.440]   personal comfort don't you think that they made a great pivot though that
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.120]   Microsoft did a very good pivot and they are in fact no longer really the
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.240]   Windows company or even the office company look how many times they mentioned
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.400]   Windows in the past you're is pretty strong few big conferences and they're
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.080]   a hell of a Linux company well I guess the point I agree with fast in here
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.400]   right the point my point would be is that Microsoft's consumer division which
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.640]   makes Windows and surfaces it's just as far as I'm concerned a waste of time and
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.160]   you should just I would much rather see something else emerged to take up that
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.360]   space that actually works and hasn't got 25 years of baggage behind it like
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.440]   you know as we've seen the Android and iOS actually make products which work
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.800]   fundamentally reliably and yet Microsoft surface or Microsoft Windows 10 is
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.600]   demonstrably incompetent by comparison so it's hard for me to get excited about
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.460]   a surface thing any jiggy that Microsoft's consumer division would
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.800]   power out I think that you're right about Microsoft Azure I'm very excited about
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.760]   Azure I think they've done some good work there to make these product that
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.920]   product actually work but it's pretty hard not to because they're on the hook
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.280]   for the whole thing there's no way for them to shift blame to so it's a
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.160]   different product market and a different business focus the good news
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.000]   about the Windows ecosystem is you I mean for instance I've replaced the
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.640]   surface studio which I had here with the Lenovo which is about half the price
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.320]   and I think in many respects a better piece of hardware I like it a lot this
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.440]   is the and again Christina you can recuse yourself this is the invitation we
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.280]   spent a long time on Windows weekly trying to figure out exactly what this
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.240]   Tron like these Tron like traces are it looks like it's a fragmentary version
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.920]   of the Windows logo yeah I mean it kind of looks like the original Windows logo
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.520]   there was actually really cool I thought kind of tie in with a stranger things
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.880]   season 3 they they did like a Windows 1.0 like release in the in the Microsoft
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.600]   store which was kind of cool that fun yeah I loved that I thought that was
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.640]   really fun and so it kind of looks like the the Windows logo the Microsoft
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.080]   logo obviously I don't know anything about this I don't want to comment I'm
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.360]   happy to hear everyone else speculate to see what they think it might be but
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.200]   yeah I mean it looks like you know trying to kind of draw lines between
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.960]   things they're they're taking a page from Apple's playbook Apple always send
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.000]   that famously obscure invitations to their events and then gets two weeks of
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.920]   solid press of people's speculating about what I was gonna announce because
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.000]   of this we were pretty sure they're gonna do a two-screen system I don't know if
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.080]   that's what we're seeing here I don't know I don't know one thing I will say
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.320]   and and I don't want to be the the resident Microsoft show here because
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.440]   that's not my role here but I do want to just stick up a little bit for I'm not
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.680]   gonna I don't work on Windows I work on Azure so thank you for the kind things
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.560]   you say about our cloud but I actually have I hadn't used as a day-to-day kind
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.920]   of device or anything Windows for quite some time until I joined Microsoft and I
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.120]   still primarily use Mac OS but I really do think that the the surface line of
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.800]   hardware is is quite good and that's all I'm gonna say I'm not saying it's
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.040]   perfect but I've actually I have a surface book as one of my work on
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.320]   your husband a surface go for crying out like you don't like your husband or
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.960]   you think the surface goes pretty good I bought it and I tested it out I wanted
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.360]   to see how good is this and I gave it to him because he actually he he broke his
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.920]   Mac book and I was like I'm not buying you new Mac but wait a minute you gave
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.120]   your husband a Windows machine instead of another Mac book he spilled stuff on
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.960]   it and so this was his punishment the surface is punishment I mean I was well
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.320]   it's funny he's actually he's been a hardcore I switched him to Mac when we
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.160]   first started dating and now he's gone full-on like Windows again but he's
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.800]   loves that surface go and it's it's a really nice little machine you know it's
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.920]   it's how I like I wish we're a little more powerful but I think in terms of
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.440]   something that that's that small and that you can do you know almost
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.120]   everything with now another thing that we may see here at this surface event is
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.600]   a new stripped down version of Windows we're expecting them to announce it at
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.280]   some point in the near future now this is really interesting because this
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.000]   comes back to my argument where if Microsoft took away all the stuff from
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.040]   20 years ago you might have an operating system that's actually secure and
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.800]   secureable and modern and runs at speed and doesn't waste battery and power
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.640]   just pointlessly so so if this happens then I'll actually be quite interested
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.720]   but at that point Microsoft isn't innovating it's just copying what other
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.000]   people have done which is to say if you're gonna build a modern networking to a
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.680]   modern computing device start by throwing everything away and building from the
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:27.240]   ground up Windows right is supposedly for this dual-screen display go ahead I'm
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.600]   sorry the hard thing about yeah the hard thing about kind of starting over
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.800]   because I understand like you know when you when you have like 20 years of legacy
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.520]   and this is true whether you're looking at like like Mac OS or Windows or even
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.840]   Linux at certain degrees is that you have like legacy you know systems that
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.120]   you have to do like I know for instance for the Windows terminal which they are
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.760]   in the process of every building right now and it's actually really awesome it's
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.080]   gonna be modular and you can get it from the Microsoft Store and and it's just in
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.280]   kind of previews right now but it's really really awesome I was talking to
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.080]   that team at build and you know they'd wanted to kind of replace some of that
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.680]   stuff for a long time of the issue was is that if they made changes to some of
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:11.040]   the code then certain machines that run like like oil reserve like like
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.360]   pipelines would potentially crash this is historically been Microsoft's problem
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:23.160]   which is that they have had to keep legacy hardware and programs working and
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.840]   they've always done a very good job of that they've wanted to well you could
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.160]   make a choice I don't know if you're running a oil rig and all of a sudden
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.880]   your windows is gonna you know I was gonna say like you've bought the operating
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.160]   system and you have Windows legacy and you have the new windows which is what
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.200]   you're talking about now there's gonna be a fork I agree I agree I grow windows
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.760]   Apple Linux you have an advantage over Microsoft because they haven't been in
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.680]   a dominant operating system and so Apple has been completely sanguine about
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.240]   saying sorry you're your five-year-old machine's not gonna work with a new
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.800]   operating system that's life but Microsoft's getting that Microsoft's
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.360]   already getting here for Windows 7 not working in January that's more than 10
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.600]   years old and people are already seven ways and what are you breaking Windows
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.120]   7 for so Microsoft is a different position and that's because they're
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.280]   dominant I think but you just it never it made up it made a business decision
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.100]   to never fork Microsoft Windows it should have gone like his Windows
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.560]   legacy it's developed it's got all the problems of Windows legacy it's awful
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.680]   it's unsafe it's insecure you have to run virus and malware scanning and you
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.160]   have to have scheduled backups it's gonna be not resistant to malware but over
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.760]   here is new windows and we want you to start moving to that and let's start
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.840]   forking the two and going down the path and Microsoft never made that
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.760]   successfully they have with NT with their with their but in their in their in
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.120]   their corner they have done this successfully but once before they split
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:55.320]   off and made Windows NT yeah that turned into Windows 2000 and Microsoft
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.640]   actually I think is still PTSD from that yeah because they had two tracks of
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.400]   Windows and that were mutually incompatible and it was a nightmare for
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.800]   the company and they eventually re-merged them by choosing and tonight
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.160]   man it was a natural industry progression well I think they did not
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.920]   like the fact that they had the Windows 98 track and the Windows NT track that
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.120]   was a problem for them and I think they decided to resolve that problem by
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.960]   making it I think that Microsoft internally wasn't competent enough to
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.160]   make the decisions that part of it wanted to stay with part of it couldn't
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.800]   make the decision to go for historically they had to go through they had to go
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.360]   through ME to do that they had to their consumer their consumer
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.520]   honestly this is historically the problem with Microsoft which is you had
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.480]   these and it's many companies get in the situation where you have these little
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.400]   fiefdoms and you had the office group and you have the Windows 98 group or ME
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.480]   group and they had the NT group and they all sniped at each other nobody you
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.520]   know the the power that the office group had for a long time was to keep
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.720]   the windows group from changing windows too much because it would break off
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   things like that and that is a that's a that's an institutional that is an
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.840]   institutional issue and a lot and it's not at all uncommon it's a very common
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.120]   it's it's very common it's but let's call it what it is it's institutional
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.200]   incompetence it's just fun it's just fun yeah and it's perfectly natural it's
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.800]   perfectly normal all big companies are stupid all big companies are inherently
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.560]   let's get credit to Sajan Adela because he came in a little more than five years
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.080]   ago and he fixed I think he fixed that problem I don't know Christina you work
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.520]   there but my sense is I wouldn't I wouldn't work there if he was not the
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.000]   CEO I think that's right if Baumur was still there wouldn't be a good company
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.600]   I don't know if yeah well he fixed it by just saying windows doesn't matter so
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.720]   stop fussing about it let's go over here yeah well let's go and do as you right
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.440]   he was right and and and the and the people who were in the windows in the
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.600]   office team and who are all going wow my problems are bigger than your problems
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.720]   just got told to shut up and get on with it and lo and behold the problem got
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.000]   solved I mean institutional incompetence is is normal I'll be watching I think
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.680]   we'll be watching with interest in October 2nd because if Microsoft does
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.920]   announce Windows Lite and I think there's a good chance they will this is an
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.840]   opportunity for them to answer your specific critique Greg and say we're
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.560]   gonna this is the fork you are looking for that's right in the same way that
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.840]   Apple proved that iOS needed to be completely different from macOS one for
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.960]   this one for that and they've been able to run the two and now they're merging
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   them back together I know which is you know but notwithstanding they're doing
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.920]   it fairly progressively you know we're going to go through a thunking remember
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.120]   the old thunking the old wind through thunk layer we're gonna see something you
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.520]   know when 16th I'm gonna see that and that sort of thing but I do believe that
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.120]   Microsoft needs to bite the bullet and bring its customers into 2015 you know
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.040]   and stop letting them run around and pretend that 2005 is still here in
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.640]   2019 and say you need to start iterating you need to let go and they've been doing
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.480]   it right you look at what happened you know they've taken what is it windows
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:05.240]   2000 is end of life windows one of the big windows releases goes end of life
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:11.960]   January that's yeah yeah I don't I tell you the big problem I have is windows
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:20.680]   10 1803 goes end of life in December that's a very recent that's from 2018 and
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:26.440]   there are a lot of people who can't upgrade to 1809 1903 or the H2
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.040]   version that's coming out because their hardware for one reason or one support
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.480]   I talked to somebody the other day who on the radio show said yeah I have an
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:39.200]   HP computer it's 10 years old now maybe it's time to buy a new computer but he
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.760]   said I can't go past 1803 because HP is not updating the BIOS Microsoft tells
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.800]   me I need an updated BIOS to go to 1809 I'm gonna be out of support in two
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.400]   months and yeah I feel for the guy it's a I know you I know what you're gonna say
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.600]   Carson yeah but it's a 10 year old computer I mean I have a I have a
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   wonderful iPad iPad that still works but yeah that's the thing if it still
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.520]   works what won't support it's not gonna support right it's not like your car
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.080]   with a hundred thousand miles it works perfectly that has not been put out of
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.600]   life by right I was gonna say you can't Apple has put Apple put stuff out of
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.520]   life much faster much like I was gonna just say like the one point I will make
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.960]   on that is that and you know I primarily a man Apple user but I can't
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:31.240]   think of in mark like I can't actually think of it of a 2009 era Mac product
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.120]   that will be able to run Catalina that's right and so I think that at a certain
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.000]   point like I totally empathize and I and I feel like it sucks especially when
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.920]   it's something that seems like it could be easily solved like a BIOS issue why
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.440]   you can't go from one version of Windows 10 to another like they're going to be
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.600]   these edge cases but when you're at a certain point like you have to have a
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.600]   cut off somewhere right so it's almost like we're having this we're having to
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.520]   parallel conversations on the one hand we're saying you have to push people
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.440]   forward and then the other hand you're saying but when you push people forward
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.480]   people are going to say but wait a minute I can't use my old stuff you know
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.920]   so there there's like if you want to move things forward then at a certain
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.600]   point you have to maybe say okay even if your stuff is still working the
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.400]   downside is you're not gonna be able to run the latest version Mac OS although
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.040]   you could get a version of Linux that will be modern up to date and secure
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.520]   that'll run on that old HP just fine for right now I mean the the interesting
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.480]   thing there though is that you know with all the some of the big distros
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.080]   dropping 32-bit support you'll obviously be able to find some Linux
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.800]   distro that will still be there but I mean there is the whole thing with the
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.200]   Bonshu dropping 32-bit binaries they've backtracked on that because Steam
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.880]   hitched a fit in the community was right we're gonna revolt but canonical was
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.520]   gonna do that with the very next version of Ubuntu coming out in October
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:51.600]   and it's a lot of the Linux packages are are not optimized for 32-bit and aren't
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   going to be there's also a big you know Python end-of-life happening 2.7 to
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.360]   Python 2 is going end-of-life at the end of the year and that's gonna impact a
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.120]   bunch of older packages too so even though Linux is the thing that everybody
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.000]   always goes to and yes you'll be able to find specialized distros I'm sure that
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.440]   will always be optimized well for older hardware if you're looking at even the
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.440]   mainline Linux distros you know you're looking at Ubuntu you're looking at
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.480]   Fedora you're looking at Red Hat whatever there's a difference those are
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.680]   distros created by companies just like Microsoft and the distros that are kept
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.360]   up to date are not by companies but they're by enthusiasts and they say well I
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.720]   want my old hardware to continue to run so I'm gonna make sure it does so so
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.520]   let's follow the money on this right if you follow the money you tell them
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.180]   throw out that old computer it but that's not necessarily bad
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:44.900]   you know to go to a certain Debian based distro and get something or are you going
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.220]   to you know try to get something that's tried and true and it's going to tell
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.820]   you this doesn't work you know so at a certain point like obviously if you have
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.460]   that if you know what you're doing you can find a way to repurpose your
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.960]   hardware but whether it's it's because off the raffle or the major
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.460]   normal people normal people aren't gonna go and find do the things that you
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.580]   talk about like that's why I'm on a crusade to tell normal people don't
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.260]   throw it out you can put Linux on it I'm on a crusade to tell them that because
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.580]   that stuff's perfectly good it's that it doesn't yeah and then so so let's go
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.780]   back to why Microsoft hasn't abandoned Win32 and the answer is they don't want
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.900]   to give a competitor a chance to enter the market because if they force
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.580]   customers like they are saying to customers now your 10 year old computers
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.420]   no good there's a pretty good chance that they'll just throw the computer out
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.300]   and go buy an Apple iPhone or an Android and then Microsoft in the
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.780]   consumer division has lost that customer going forward and we've seen plenty of
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.380]   evidence of that as the you know the window I don't think that's honestly
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.620]   don't think that's the motivation because I don't think Microsoft cares
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.900]   if no you're wrong Microsoft doesn't care about Windows at all anymore the
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.620]   motivation it the motivation is just as Christina said there's a nuclear power
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:59.500]   plant in Bello Rusa that's running with 32-bit software and honestly I think
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.900]   Microsoft is a is being a good corporate citizen they're just saying
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.580]   understand you got to have 32 bit we're going to keep supporting it even though
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.700]   it's a security nightmare and I think they're not doing that for economic
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.620]   reasons I don't think there is a good economic reason for that no but we need
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:21.660]   to get those companies who aren't to to who's sitting there saying I can't move
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.620]   off Windows 2000 or Windows 95 or whatever it is right and they have to
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.420]   bite the bullet and be pushed they're not going to if they can keep going back to
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.820]   people like you and me and saying we can't upgrade because wow why why they
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.260]   don't they just sit there and put and and as long as it's working it's fine
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.500]   that's the problem because we have an insecure internet with all these people
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:48.900]   running Windows 98 you're never gonna get rid of you know Melissa and it's not
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.420]   like these people float around forever and it's not like these people don't
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.740]   know this isn't coming right it's we've been telling them for 10 years you can't
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.580]   keep doing this and guess what they've done Nada okay so I think it's been
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.180]   coming into 20 years ago with with Y2K right I mean but you still have people
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.620]   who maintain cobalt systems to this day you still have mainframe systems I mean
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.220]   this is I don't disagree that this is a problem but this has been a problem
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.180]   that's been around for I mean at least 20 years now that we've been having this
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.060]   conversation where you know older infrastructure people will not upgrade
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:26.260]   and will not pay for the the price to you know build to rebuild as long as it's
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:30.580]   working that they will have to be pushed prodded and and you know threatened you
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.020]   know with some sort of catastrophic thing to Microsoft's not the only company
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.180]   having an event we're gonna take a break and then we can parse the Apple
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.940]   invitation see what it means some tea leads now folks you know what I was
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.580]   talking about when I started the show and saying all we need is to that may
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:53.580]   be too many Greg Greg Faro the packet pushers network Christina Warren from
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.700]   Microsoft who can definitely hold her own when Carson said we've got Christina
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:04.420]   and Greg I said stop that's perfect that's perfect say no more say no more I
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.020]   show today brought to you by our friends at IT Pro TV we've been with IT
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:14.340]   Pro TV since they first started Tim and Donna were great friends fact I had
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.700]   lunch with them last week when I was in Orlando were trainers they trained
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.460]   people to get the certs they need to get the IT jobs they wanted but they were
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.540]   doing it in a classroom environment they came to an NAB presentation I was
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.980]   part of talking about what we're doing it twits streaming and they said you know
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:38.060]   this would be a great way to do IT training and IT Pro TV was born they now
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:44.220]   have over 4,000 hours of on-demand IT training they're the official video
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.060]   training partner for CompTIA in fact they have 12 CompTIA on-demand courses
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.780]   these are the most hotly demanded certs like A+ network plus and security
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:26:01.700]   plus they are amazing they are teaching so many people thousands of people now
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.900]   have gone through IT Pro TV and got a great job most of those people stay with
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.700]   IT Pro TV because it's not now just for getting the certs it's for keeping your
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:16.060]   chops up so you can continue to become a better and better IT professional you
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.260]   know there's some stuff that IT Pro TV now is doing that I we've never mentioned
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.020]   before but I want to let you know about they can help if you want to do training
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.580]   videos they can help you in your organization make your own videos they
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.780]   have an amazing studio they built in Gainesville with robotic cameras HD
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:36.780]   video DMX lighting dimmable LED lighting they've got an overhead talkback monitor
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.700]   you know the voice of God we don't even have the voice of God I always wanted
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:44.140]   the voice of God a direct live streaming system you could pick from multiple HD
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.980]   studios bring your own host or use one of their great personable smart hosts so
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.620]   from planning to post-production if you want to make it for your organization

[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:59.420]   to be an IT we've gone IT Pro TV and are now working in great jobs thank you IT
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:08.340]   Pro TV go.itpro.tv/twit promo code is Twit 30 Apple sent out the invitations on
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:13.100]   Thursday Lori Gill on Tuesday during my break we really said I predict I don't
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.620]   know if she knew she knew something or something she's I predict Thursday so
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:22.380]   that's that's it it's a week from Tuesday it's September 10 that's kind of
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.580]   what we thought it'll be of course it mm-hmm the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:30.380]   Park this is the invitation it's a kind of a beautiful glass Apple with all the
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.020]   colors they're gone back to the colors haven't they the rainbow yeah it's
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.540]   interesting though right because it's it's slightly different like they don't
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.700]   have the full six colors like I do like having the purple in there but yeah it's
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.020]   that's Boise it's because why you talked to somebody like Christina I didn't even
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.660]   know there's only five colors you're right yeah no I was looking at that I was
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.820]   like who I was like where's the orange and I was kind of looking at this stuff
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.940]   I was like oh that's interesting that they have purple there see what I mean
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:29:02.580]   talk about Kremlinology and then it says by innovation only that's just a
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:07.900]   pun I don't know if you can read into that still are you going Christina do you
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:14.620]   still get those invites no I do not get those invites I wish I would love to go
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.060]   that would be amazing but no I do not get those invites ironically I will be in
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.740]   San Francisco or not San Francisco San Jose on the 11th but I will not be there
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:28.620]   on the 10th I know you could probably change your flight I know I could well
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.900]   - I don't see that it's too crazy it's one of those things already like Tim Apple
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:41.940]   Tim Apple she still loves you I do I do I love Apple I obviously you know love
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:47.220]   Microsoft but Apple always has a very soft spot spot my heart and obviously
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.380]   I'll be watching from the Microsoft offices probably with the with the
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.660]   office for Mac team which is what I usually do I usually have a spot with
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:00.300]   the people from the on the office for Mac team we watch like we would you see in
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:05.020]   the other big announcements they're not a lot of question marks as usual once
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.100]   they get to manufacturing these new phones the leaks from China come fast
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:14.060]   and furious it's expected they'll be three new phones the successors to the
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:19.780]   low price 10 are the medium-sized 10s the giant 10s Max will they be the 11 R
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:25.100]   11 and 11 Max I don't know somebody's lately they've been saying the 11 pro
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:30.220]   and it does make sense because iPad pros you got MacBook Pro so that pro line
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.820]   kind of would fit in they've never done that with the iPhone I'm not I'm less
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.260]   interested in the iPhone per se as I don't think there's going to be a a
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.420]   jump like it's hard to imagine that there's a technology shift like there
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.260]   was a jumps any five to six yeah and the six to the eight there was a
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:51.940]   substantial jump it you know if it gets half a millimeter thinner I'd actually
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.420]   be rather happier if they put a bigger battery and I sort of thing you know like
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:00.460]   that's why I love this this Note 10 plus it put a 4300 milliamp battery hour
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.900]   battery in that yeah I know I'd love a bigger battery I would like to see some
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.500]   things maybe with the camera to take on the pixel I think you're gonna see that
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.140]   Christine I do think you're gonna see that because this is now the the real
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:18.860]   battleground is no longer phone screen fingerprint touch ID the battleground
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.380]   is camera they are gonna do what Samsung did a couple of generations ago at
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:31.100]   Huawei also they're gonna put three lenses in I love it on my Samsung phones
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:36.300]   where I have a telephoto lens a normal lens and a wide-angle lens that's nice
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:43.180]   Apple is rumored not to be quite doing that they're gonna use the three lenses
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:48.700]   to do more computational stuff yeah that's what they've that's what they've
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:53.100]   always on the two lenses is to try to kind of you know create that that that
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.220]   effect I mean you could obviously switch between one over the other but you know
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.140]   they try to use them all together no that'll be interesting although I what
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.820]   I'm hoping is if they do have the three lenses that they will allow the API is
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.820]   to be used by you know certain camera apps yeah I love focus for instance which
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:14.100]   allows me to use that yeah I like that a lot too and but that would be nice if
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.700]   they have those features so that you could isolate them if you wanted to you
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.540]   know if you're using the the right tools but but I think that they like to air
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.940]   on the side of simplicity and really just make it so that we're going to give
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.940]   you the most perfect photo yeah the focus camera does some of the things the
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:38.900]   pixel does FOCOS by taking multiple images and stacking them and yeah and
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:45.580]   and Toulid is a really really good camera same guy right yes yes and and
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:51.060]   been a Sebastian and yeah I would love to see what they could do with with the
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:56.700]   third camera yeah and of course you're gonna see a pixel for a month later and
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:01.620]   it seems to be the Google keeps leapfrogging the camera capabilities of
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:06.660]   Apple yeah with yeah right after Apple announces all these new features Google
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.740]   says well well because because Google is so much further ahead with the AI stuff
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.420]   right like I think that when it comes to the hardware Apple has has historically
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.700]   you know they've been able to source the best sensor some Sony and do really
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.540]   good stuff and for a really long time they also had the best software they were
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:26.420]   able to really write the software to make those sensors just do amazing things
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.940]   where you could have the exact same sensor in a you know Samsung phone and an
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.020]   iPhone and the iPhone would give you better results but Google because they
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.460]   are so much further ahead with the AI stuff you know they are doing some
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:42.300]   really incredible things on the software side that is I think that honestly this
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.500]   is one of those areas where Apple's commitment to privacy hurts them because
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:51.700]   they don't use their user data the same way because they have this this both
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.860]   public and kind of internal kind of policy about how they're using this
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.820]   information they don't have all those data points where they can build models to
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:04.780]   do things like okay we're going to light up you know darker images and
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:10.020]   expose them so that you so it looks like you've got you know full light like
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:14.380]   pixel can and and to do you know even things like a you know portrait mode and
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:19.420]   whatnot like if you compare the the AI portrait mode on the iPhone XR and on
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.940]   the pixel there's no comparison the pixels significantly better and I think
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.580]   it's because Google because they have so much so many more data points and
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.020]   because they're not opposed to using those while they're building their
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:35.140]   software they're on a big advantage and so I'm interested to see what Apple's
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.100]   able to do on that front I don't doubt that they have the engineering talent to
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:43.740]   do amazing things but I do wonder it's like you know Google does have this this
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   huge treasure trove of you know you know billions of data points from users
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.780]   who've been using I think that's I've stated I don't think I think that
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.700]   Google's much touted AI thing that's not as a competitive edge as people think
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.340]   really I think it's yeah no I think it's much more about getting the software
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.900]   right down on the camera and the control of the sensor but Apple's been very
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:09.980]   conservative about the sensors that it buys and Google's been much more willing
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:15.780]   to throw more resources but the car so we had a dedicated AI chip for photo
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.980]   imaging yeah but yeah correspondingly the pixel 3 is weaker in a number of
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:24.460]   other areas it's the rounding out of no I agree with you about Apple balances
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:29.340]   the photo like focusing on the photo capability ignores dozens of other
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:34.180]   features of just the point the pixel 3 for a long time closed out programs
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.220]   overly aggressively there's all sorts of software issues for memory management
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.180]   rubbish battery life it's open to malware it's about as the most one of the
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.620]   most vulnerable smartphones in the market well the list goes on every
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.980]   phone's up in a malware we have a story a little later on about Apple and Malware
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.380]   we'll get to but so my point would be don't over rotate on just taking photos
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:56.980]   because that's one of 400 features in a smartphone I would be much more
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:01.780]   looking for wireless charging I'm very tired of lightning cables super tired
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:09.100]   well Apple is wireless charging now no you don't have it X the 10s yeah and
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.260]   what about the watch watch is wireless but you have to have a special puck and
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.660]   remember Apple tried to make the airpower and put a multi another's done it
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.340]   yeah yeah I would like to see the the sort of the promise that we got with a
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.180]   wireless charging out of the last event actually come out so Apple ships its
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:30.500]   wireless charger using a power is dead get with it yeah they already said
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.260]   we're not gonna make it with we can't know I'm aware that what I'm saying is
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.180]   the commitment was they're coming with wireless charging but you know a couple
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.540]   of models of phone isn't the whole range why isn't the can't don't just have a
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:48.100]   charging pad that all my devices go on I I'm expecting to see new AirPods I think
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:52.340]   Apple's making a big commitment to wearables I think they see that everybody's
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.340]   gonna buy a phone it really doesn't matter what they ship they'll make good
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.780]   money out of it the new watch will also be announced I expect their way of
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.540]   growing their business is to get more services but also to grow adjacent
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:09.620]   markets to this smartphone accessories I think Apple's watches AirPods and iCloud
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.060]   you know the cloud services and so forth but so I would expect at this event to
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:18.140]   see growth in watches and AirPods and other accessories heart health
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.900]   accessories so you don't think that Apple has a disadvantage because of its
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:27.380]   stated privacy policy compared to Google and even Facebook and Amazon where
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.660]   these companies are happy to gather all the information about you they can
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:35.780]   doesn't that help them with their with at least with their voice assistant I
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:40.580]   don't believe so I think you can hear the story that Google pushes and you
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:46.260]   think that's it's correct when you go and talk to people who do DLML AI they'll
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.780]   actually tell you that once the models are trained you don't need the lakes of
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:53.580]   data the data lakes aren't actually all that relevant and you can send it down
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.820]   so you don't need Google even said that at Google I owe they said you know we're
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.380]   gonna take these trained sets and we're gonna compress them way down and you're
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.100]   having all on the phone and that course that's what apples wanted to do for a
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.420]   long time which is exactly whether you've got one petabyte or ten petabytes or
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.860]   a hundred petabytes of images doesn't matter the same models result getting
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.100]   that initial data is the problem getting to that initial model because I mean
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.500]   the thing is is that look Apple has finally started to publish things in AI
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.880]   journals which is great but Google you know the TensorFlow I mean I you I
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.220]   don't think it's it's arguable I think it's actually completely inarguable the
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:32.100]   Google is very far ahead when it comes to AI as compared to Apple just all out
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.020]   you know I mean I'm not making that's what the statement that I'm making is
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.300]   whether you've got a one petabyte data lake or a hundred petabyte data lake
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.620]   doesn't necessarily improve the models I don't think that my point is I don't
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:48.020]   think the model is on iPhone are anywhere near as good as the models on
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.740]   Google anybody who use Siri has used Siri knows that anybody who's used
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:57.420]   Apple photos I do series a different series is about five years behind
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:02.260]   Google's voice so it just doesn't have time in the development cycle well but
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.620]   it started five years earlier and it actually started ten years earlier
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:09.300]   because it started as a DARPA project I mean it goes way back yeah yeah I mean
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:16.220]   yes they bought Siri was in an Apple in 2011 and and you know and Google
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.620]   assistant came out later and and Google might have been doing some voice up but
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.140]   they certainly it wasn't as if they were years ahead of Apple but I mean
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:28.580]   even just looking in terms of like your data models though so look at Google
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:33.140]   photos I don't use this but most iPhone users I know do look at Apple photos
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.220]   some of the big features with iOS 13 and I joked about this like in June I was
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:42.140]   like oh finally you know Apple photos is going to be getting you know the some
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.940]   of the same features the Google photos has literally had for years but if you
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.940]   ever but I know even without using you know the final version of iOS 13 it's
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.340]   not going to be he as good as Google photos now I just personally don't like
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.900]   I don't I feel weird trusting on my photos to Google again I don't care about
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:04.100]   photos as much as I care about a better calendar app or a better hey Siri or a
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:08.420]   better home kit or a better user I'm just saying that when you're looking at
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.740]   the models if you're making that kind of argument I don't disagree that that at
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.820]   a certain point it doesn't matter how big the sizing Apple focuses on the
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.460]   90-10 rule and if 90% of the people take a photo and that looks good we're done
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:24.180]   yes we just don't need to keep you're exactly right nobody cares but quite
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.460]   honestly I don't care I can take my phone out I can take a photo and it's
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.340]   perfectly good enough I don't all these things that you're talking about make no
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:36.220]   sense to me whatsoever because I take a photo for my personal menu memories I
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:40.300]   do not expect to pull out halide and start adjusting the focus and the white
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.660]   balance all I want to do is take a photo of my daughter and I'm done although
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:50.300]   that's kind of what Google has done with a single lens on the Pixel 3 is you take
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.820]   the picture and it's a great picture that's that's I think what they're going
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:58.860]   for yeah but that's what Google does whether the little goblins pop out and
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:03.300]   go take the photo for you and whatever I want to see is wireless charging
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:08.180]   Apple's problem which is I still believe Apple has a problem between this desire
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.460]   for privacy and this ability to make Siri better and they just two days ago
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.980]   put out a press release talking about changes they're gonna make in the way
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:22.800]   Siri gathers data they even say in this in this section here how data makes
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:28.100]   Siri better they talk about the thing they got in trouble for grading which is
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:33.500]   having humans listen to the requests and they said that there's a value but as a
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.300]   result of people's privacy concerns we realize we haven't been fully living up
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.020]   to our high ideals ideals and for that we apologize so they're not gonna buy
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:48.500]   default retain audio anymore users will have to opt in to help Siri improve I
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.700]   think that's gonna hurt them because most people are not gonna opt in and when
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:56.460]   customers opt in it will no longer be contract workers listening it'll be
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:00.740]   only Apple employees that's gonna cost Apple but of course Apple has plenty of
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:06.780]   money so I think Apple I think Apple is caught I think Apple put that big sign
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:10.380]   up at CES saying what happens in your iPhone stays in your iPhone they got
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:16.260]   caught by the Guardian because it wasn't true credit to Apple they're gonna
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.580]   improve series privacy protections but I think that's gonna hurt them I don't
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.900]   think it will because I don't think anybody gives a hoot right and I don't
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.900]   think I do I don't use Siri because I'm tired of Siri saying let me tell you
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.980]   what I found on the web for that that's not I want to make an appointment or
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.700]   they're not using Google voice either it's a feature that no one uses
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:40.660]   mostly because they're in alpha these voice agents are so let me ask like
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.460]   Christina do you use a voice assistant ever yeah I mean I was gonna say it all
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:49.340]   the time yeah I and it was what's actually funnier to me is that the not I
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.140]   probably it's like the more technical people that I know probably use them
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:57.420]   less I see less technical people using Google assistance in using Amazon
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:04.620]   my in-laws they will say allow Aloysius play Elvis yeah my mom uses her
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.620]   Aloysius all the time I have you know other relatives who have kind of a
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.900]   combination of Google homes or you know Amazon devices I'll tell you another
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.140]   data point that is actual data point five percent of our listeners listen on
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:22.020]   voice-activated devices Google Homer or that's a big that's huge that's a five
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:26.380]   percent increase in price here's a here's a data point we in our audience the
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:32.420]   number zero well you've got different audience it was just saying the more
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:37.260]   technical audience yeah I was gonna say more technical but it's actually what's
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:41.100]   interesting to is what I see kids all the time interacting with them like very
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.260]   very actively and and it's that's interesting to me in the same way that
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:48.740]   touch you know we very quickly kind of starting with the iPhone have there's
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.340]   been this whole generation that's been this touch first generation where you
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.460]   see it where they they touch every screen whether it's a TV screen or a
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:58.220]   computer monitor or whatever they just expect to interact with it that way I
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.620]   don't think we're quite there with voice but I'm starting to see more and
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.740]   more you know kids of especially younger kids who just immediately
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:11.420]   instinctively notice to start talking to their devices and I would use series
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:18.620]   more if it were better right like I use it to subtle arms and I use it that's
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:22.660]   basically kind of what I and sometimes to play music but I wish I could use it
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:27.140]   for more things I just haven't been able to rely on it in so long whereas I do
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:33.060]   use you know my Amazon devices for you know to here's some more stats this was
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.220]   from the podcast movement we were at a couple of weeks ago Edison research
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.460]   interviewed two different groups of podcast listeners longtime listeners
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:44.540]   they called them veterans and newer listeners they call them rookies of the
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:49.780]   veteran 7% listen to podcast most on a smart speaker of the rookies 9% it's a
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:55.460]   larger number and I honestly in fact I think what you're really seeing here is
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:00.580]   fewer of the new listeners listen on computers yep and and more and more
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:05.820]   phones and smart devices and so I think voice I honestly think voice is I think
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:13.780]   Greg you're an outlier my 12 year old my grandparents they have all switched
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.580]   to listening to only music on using a voice assistant my 12 year old does all
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:23.220]   of his web searching through a voice that's that's Bob that mind boggles that's
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.860]   that's no link to click afterwards I guess you just want to look something up
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:31.540]   instead of typing it that's interesting saves him a lot of time yeah so it's
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:35.860]   really conditioning I do have to push back I have to push back on Greg against
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:41.820]   his wireless charging accusations because every single product that Apple has
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:46.380]   shipped since they made that the wireless including the new AirPods
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:50.540]   including the new airmen including the watch including the iPhone they all
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.860]   wireless wireless charge everything with the guy doesn't charge to people
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:59.700]   wireless charging to people want that is that a real important feature I use it
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.980]   I use it for like I wish it were faster I wish it were faster right like I have
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:09.860]   a pad on my desk at work that I drop my air pod case and my phone on if it were
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:13.660]   faster I would I would probably use it more and I would say this like I don't
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.620]   drive but I could imagine that if you are in a car and you have you know like a
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.500]   Qi charger you know mount thing like I know movie makes them that would be
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:24.700]   really useful right to be able to kind of wirelessly charge your phone while
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:29.020]   it's in the car without having to have yet another kind of plug hanging out but
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:34.420]   for me it's that the slowdown that's that's the issue but I see people using
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.380]   it all the time I just saw I just often forget that I even had it like I said
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:42.580]   I've got the pad I do it for overnight so I have a I have a charger next to my
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.300]   bed and that's a that seems to me like the place people would use it most
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.420]   often yeah see and I have it's my my charge and ex my bad I guess it's got
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.420]   the thing where it has the place where I can put my it's one of those 12 South
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:58.220]   chargers and it has like a place to watch and the air pods and the fun yeah and so
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:03.140]   yeah so I just kind of plug everything in but at work I finally found a use
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:06.340]   that Qi charger once I got the AirPods with the wireless charging case it was
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:12.060]   like oh that's you this this is my surface studio replacement it's a
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:18.780]   Lenovo yoga it has a Qi charger right here see that is that wild it's actually
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.540]   on the base of the computer so I can charge my have my phone charge while
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.620]   it's sitting there is that wild see that is brilliant that well done Lenovo
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.500]   because that's actually really smart and there are a number of a like a couch
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:36.420]   companies now that are putting like USB plugs into their so I can't I can't
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.900]   is putting until there's tables which I love but but I'm hoping maybe the next
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.660]   thing will be like Qi chargers - you know so I guess I guess we are saying
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:50.940]   wireless Greg was right wireless is the next big thing yeah I that what I didn't
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.740]   say that it wasn't there what I was saying was that I want to see more
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.340]   progress around that front I think that we've had a good first effort and I'd
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:02.260]   like to see more wireless and instead of having to pay a hundred dollar hundred
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.620]   pound premium for AirPods that support wireless charging it should be the
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:09.460]   default should be everything I'm sure that's what's gonna yeah and and then as
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:13.300]   Christina says it should can we get faster while and now I know there's
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:18.420]   perfectly practical technology reasons as to why they're not but you know I'd
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.900]   like to see that happen I also wonder if Apple will start to focus more on
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:26.140]   fitness people are very much in love with these rings that monitor sleep and
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:30.160]   heart rate and I think that's a natural market for Apple to be in they should
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.780]   maybe that would be interesting wouldn't it yeah I actually had an instance this
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:38.900]   week where my Apple Watch really helped me because my my heart rate was elevated
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:44.420]   and it was like my resting heart rate was like 165 likes yeah no so I'd go to
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.540]   the ER and I have an appointment with a cardiologist on Tuesday I saw your
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:51.620]   tweet I meant to ask you are you okay yeah I think so I think that I might have
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:55.380]   been the hydrated I'm getting some stuff checked out but it was having the watch
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:00.420]   was amazing for a couple of reasons a I was able to run the the the EKG which
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:04.340]   even though it didn't detect anything it showed the sinus for them and so the
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:09.460]   the doctor was able to look at it but he you know had the whole history of like
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:13.340]   that because I started to feel it higher in my resting heart rate when it was like
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:17.180]   one 15 120 I was a little concerned and then it started getting higher than that
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.340]   did you get the warning from the watch to the watch said you're not doing anything
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.700]   right and then and then my arms started tingling and that's when when we
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:29.300]   started to kind of freak out and and so you know as we go to the hospital I'm
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.980]   too young to have a heart attack Kristi I know I know and I didn't have a heart
[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:36.100]   attack it wasn't that we we were not really sure I might have been some
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.780]   dehydration might be some anemia who knows but I have an appointment on Tuesday
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:44.300]   it's gonna be fine but having all that data there if I had known this I would
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:49.260]   not have booked Greg Ferro on the show I apologize we're gonna kill Christina
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:54.940]   no I'm fine we're having fun you're gonna give her a heart attack Greg you
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:59.500]   told me like you wanted to have a show so like you know she's gonna pass out
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:09.460]   but genuinely you know it's probably a bad thing for certain hypochondriacs to
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:13.100]   have access to all your health information that way but for me it was
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.140]   really beneficial and I wasn't there wasn't one of those things where I was
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.380]   even like it was funny when it got super high and we moved into the the
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:23.380]   hospital we were telling them they were like were you freaking out when it was
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.340]   this high and I looked at my husband he was like no she wasn't really I was like
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.860]   no I was I was the calm one he was the one who was freaking out but having you
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.860]   know the history of all that stuff to show I think is so important and even
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:38.260]   the doctor was talking about how great it was yeah come in now just information
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.420]   more is better right even if it's not medical
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:46.980]   whatever it's still useful yeah yeah even though it's not calibrated or
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:51.220]   medically it's like no not permissible in a court of law it's not
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:56.020]   necessarily right but they can use that yeah yeah I mean it's better I have a
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:59.180]   baseline I can show this was history this is what my heart was doing from this
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.220]   period to this period do me a favorite Christina though if your watch says
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.300]   anything's going on let me know we've got amp prue it in the wings we could
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:13.140]   swap out amp prue it's very calm relaxed soothing and and we could save
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:18.020]   Greg for it somebody we want to wake up I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:22.380]   she'll be fine let's take a break because actually I kind of buried maybe the
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:27.980]   most important store Apple story of all Apple is changing its right to repair
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:32.060]   stance this is dramatic and we'll talk about that in just a little bit but first
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:38.340]   a word from our sponsors give you all a chance let your heart rate go down calm
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.740]   down with the blood pressure do you ever have panic attacks Christina because
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:44.380]   that sounds like it could have been a panic attack yeah but it wasn't that I
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:48.300]   was literally like I was getting out of the shower and I felt it and I put my
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.820]   watch on I looked and I was like mmm thanks and they went to start going
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:56.860]   higher when I was sitting down I was like yeah so I texted my my boss I had a
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:02.660]   meeting I was like we saw the tweet we saw the tweet yeah yeah tweet after I
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:07.700]   was fine but because I wanted to like let people know you know the watch is
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.580]   good yeah basically it's pretty amazing you're not the first person who's told
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:19.780]   me stories like that I the other day I was I was I was doing this kind of weird
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:25.820]   push-up you do with with dumbbells what do you call those there's a name for
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:30.380]   him and I put the dumbbell down too hard and my watch said did you follow you
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:37.340]   okay is everything all right are you dead and then but that wasn't that was
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:40.340]   okay I understood that but then I was dancing into the same thing I thought
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.980]   oh this is not good finally enough when I was hit by the car watch said nothing
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:48.580]   nothing although that might have been before the update of the software for
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.100]   that stuff I don't know but when I was hit by when I was hit by the car the
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:58.180]   watch was like it was cool so she just is this the bus the when you got hit by
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:03.500]   the bus okay I was hit by the car thrown under the bus yeah and the watch the
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:08.260]   watch goes she's fine you got an appointment at 10 minutes Christine
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:11.900]   yeah you're fleeing is dancing and the watch goes off but you get thrown under
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:16.700]   bus yeah there's some calibration my dancing though is much like being
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:21.420]   thrown under bus I just want to understand our show today brought to you by

[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:18.700]   know you heard it here August 29th two days ago Apple announced that they are
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:26.340]   going to allow independent repair providers access to genuine parts and
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:32.020]   Apple manuals this is something Apple fought tooth and nail many states almost
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:35.980]   30 states now have right to repair software in the legislature and Apple's
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:41.540]   been going to legislate your to legislators to stop it but I somebody
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:46.540]   somebody set up and said no wait a minute that's not us that's not us
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:50.660]   Jeff Williams COO says to better meet our customers needs are making it easier
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:55.340]   for independent providers across the US to tap into the same resources as our
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:59.940]   Apple authorized service provider network when it repairs needed a customer should
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:05.180]   have the conference repairs done right this is huge because it's the opposite
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:11.540]   direction Apple's been going in for years Christina are you shocked I'm shocked
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:16.420]   I'm shocked I'm so happy to see this I'm so happy to see this and a million
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:22.260]   jillion years ago when I was in college I was a tech repair PC repair person at
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:26.460]   Best Buy and I was certified to work on Apple stuff and this is before we sold
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:31.860]   a lot of Apple stuff this is when they were still the the power PC stuff you
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:37.420]   know the G3s and the G4s and whatnot and the the process of getting certified to
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.180]   be an Apple repair person because this is when they only had a handful of Apple
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:44.500]   stores was arduous and was complex and remember having to you know study this
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.260]   exam and go through all these other things and so the fact that they're a
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:52.300]   making this you know no charge to join and that you just have to be certified
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.420]   that they're going to be offering the manuals and the and the parts is massive
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:01.300]   because the problem has been regardless of your opinion on on right to repair
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:05.100]   and and some of the things that that might be asked and and some of that
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.260]   legislation or by some of the you know companies that are lobbying for that
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:13.260]   which which I can kind of see the other side of and say you know this isn't
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.700]   necessarily fair you talk about you know a user base of what like for iPhone
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:22.940]   alone is but like 1.4 billion people for iOS devices you're talking about people
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:29.260]   who don't all have access to go to Apple stores or to existing authorized repair
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:33.420]   places and so you wind up getting shoddy battery repairs or shoddy screen
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:38.460]   repairs or other issues and as we've seen with you know like the the recall on
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:43.740]   the 2015 15 inch MacBook this can have major repercussions if you need to get
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:47.980]   something you know switched out and you don't have a place to go so I think this
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:52.740]   is this is great I'm shocked to see it but I'm very very happy to see this and I
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:57.420]   hope that this means that you know this that I hope this will make it easier for
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:02.540]   people both to get legitimate parts and offer quality repairs I think the the
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:08.220]   challenge is going to be now how do you make sure that where you're going is
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:12.580]   going to be giving you you know like good qualified service you know what I'm
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:16.140]   saying like that well go to an Apple certified technician I guess an Apple
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:20.260]   is off as you mentioned they're offering that certification for free right right
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:24.300]   and I guess it's now it just becomes a consumer kind of education part where you
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.900]   want to say look we have all these certified places but you need to go to
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:33.540]   a certified place and not just you know the the the you know shop the the phone
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:38.300]   repair shop you know on the corner in the strip mall where the guy comes out you
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:42.940]   know for a girl comes out the back with you know and I fix it toolkit and some
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:47.100]   battery they got for the Amazon you know that's not a good idea by the way we
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:52.140]   should mention if you want in warranty repairs you'll go to an Apple authorized
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:57.100]   repair person if you're doing it out of warranty and that's the thing is if it's
[00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.700]   out of warranty you want to you don't want to spend a lot of money on repairs
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:04.780]   that's who this is for this independent repair provider yeah but I think there's
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:08.380]   a few I think everything Christine said is quite accurate and correct I think
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:12.820]   it's good that we have more choices about where we get our plate equipment
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.540]   repaired because Apple stores are not conveniently located to everybody there
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:21.420]   are often in arcane places like town centers which are hard to get to if you
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:25.140]   happen to live really or whatever like that so having being able to get to
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:29.860]   alternative supplies what concerns me is that part of the reason that Apple
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:35.380]   stopped letting other people do the repairs was because of repair fraud so in
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:39.340]   China particularly there was companies what they would do is buy iPhones open
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:43.420]   them up put cheap copies of the part of the parts back inside and then send them
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:47.220]   back to Apple as faulty phones Apple would replace them under warranty yep and
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:51.340]   then they'd sell those parts as genuine right so there was that an
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.820]   apparently well this is a good way to address it which is to give you an
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.700]   opportunity to buy genuine parts which you didn't have exactly right so there's
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:04.300]   that there is a there is a risk that you'll have fraudulent repairs going on and
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:07.820]   the way that Apple's done it at the moment is if you take it in to Apple
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:12.180]   then the threat the repairs will always be of a non-quantity yes they're
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.620]   expensive no you don't have any choice but you know exactly what you're getting
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:20.700]   this opens them up for the risk of repair fraud where people use non-genuine
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:24.260]   parts to repair phones and blah blah blah now the second part about this is
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:28.340]   also supply chain integrity which is a lot of these modern phones are moving
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:34.180]   into secure enclaves and chips that have security technologies like for example
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:38.020]   when you the chip that does your thumbprint is completely isolated from the
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.260]   phone and when you change that you actually have to have a piece of
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:44.980]   software so that you could update the crypto key on board and link it with the
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:49.420]   secure enclave that's on the motherboard of the phone and so on and so forth so
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:53.140]   part of what Apple's doing here is actually taking the software that enables
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.460]   those parts to work together so when you replace the board inside of an iPhone
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.940]   and match it with a screen there's actually a security handshake between
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:04.740]   the two you can't put a third-party element in there and the reason for that
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:09.380]   is because everything that's in there is in theory hackable like we've seen
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:14.220]   with the baseboards and the BNC's and the BIOS's and we actually you know
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:18.180]   they had an issue with that I guess it was three years ago when they started
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:22.300]   having kind of faulty repairs with the the thumbprint sensor where if you because
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.020]   a lot of times what would happen is exactly what you said is that you get the
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:31.020]   secure enclave between the home button and the screen are linked and so a lot
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:34.180]   of times what would happen is that repairplaces that were not genuine would
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.380]   replace the screen but keep the button the same so they wouldn't have to go
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.940]   through that handshake again but if they did something else it might work at
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:45.220]   first and then there was an operating system update that broke those devices
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:51.020]   and gave like a certain error code and there was about a bunch of pushback on
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:55.100]   that and Apple eventually issued a software update that overcame that but
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.780]   yeah I mean that this has been something they've been grappling with where
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:01.180]   obviously they had these you know secure enclave parts of the devices that they
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:04.980]   want to protect that are very important to kind of integrity of the phone but
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:10.660]   you've been in this Keshe 22 where you either have access to the official parts
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.660]   or you don't I still think the biggest issue comes down to a lot of it
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:18.980]   consumer education and I mean I agree with you they do are they're going to be
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.220]   running the risk of having some like you know fraud and in terms of repair and
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:28.220]   in parts and that sort of thing but hopefully this could be this sort of
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.380]   thing at least my hope is that if you have more places that are authorized and
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:37.900]   that can buy the authorized parts then you limit I guess the A the likelihood of
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.100]   people having bad repairs which does actually becomes a hazard not just for
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:46.740]   individuals but for everybody around them but also you know making situations
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:50.660]   like we're placing you know the the the fingerprint reader or something else
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:54.700]   my point is that there's two sides of this argument there is the right of
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.780]   people to repair the systems and to make them good but the other side is Apple
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:03.600]   has demonstrated commitment to protecting their brand and part of that is to
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:07.940]   make sure that the parts that are in the gear are secure and safe and haven't
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.980]   been compromised which is something that we've seen in the Android land where
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.460]   people take phones in and they come back riddled with malware right so just be
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:23.020]   aware that opening up the repairs opens you up to a security risk albeit and
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:27.260]   this is why Apple is keeping it very closed approved repair centers people
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.220]   will be issued with software that software will have to have a supply
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:34.100]   chain because if those people plug it in and that secure enclave gets linked to
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.420]   that motherboard then that has to be this is not just let them buy parts and
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:42.140]   fix it it's a little bit more complicated I think then most people would think
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.820]   until you start to understand some of the pieces that's what I was trying to
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.820]   highlight with my points
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:56.940]   well those pieces may cost 15% more as of midnight today the US tariffs have
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:01.420]   gone into effect September 1st they don't they're they've been deferred to
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:07.340]   December 15th for laptops and phones because the Trump administration doesn't
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:12.340]   want to quote hurt the holiday buying season but they are already in effect
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:16.860]   now for parts other parts that come from China including this one affect Apple
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:23.540]   AirPods Apple watches headphones some iMacs the home pod and parts the kinds
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:27.820]   of parts you get to repair these devices those are all going to be affected it's
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:32.780]   not just Apple of course it's any company that imports parts or products
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:42.300]   from China 15% now December 15th it goes to 25% so I think it's I think
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:46.140]   this is going to be interesting what we're seeing in enterprise IT is all of the
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:52.580]   major IT companies are shifting there they call it production to Vietnam yep
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:58.660]   that's exactly what China and Apple's doing yeah they're not bringing them home
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:03.500]   to the United States no well because it's another country the problems can
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:07.500]   chase you everywhere they can go anywhere you want so so what they're not
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.180]   actually doing is they're not actually producing them they're not actually
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.580]   setting up factories they're doing the final assembly phase so the actual parts
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.500]   and everything is still being made so it goes back I don't know if you remember
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.980]   the trade wars of the 1970s the 1980s but there was all these ways of saying
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:25.500]   you know we had input tariffs on things and all this sort of stuff and then
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:30.060]   people would ship the prepped unpack like the unassembled and it would go to
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:34.220]   somewhere and then it would be a game this stuff oh yeah and I mean Apple's
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:37.300]   Apple's a great example of this like even before this trade where stuff
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.780]   exactly what Greg is talking about like they've had this process set up for
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:44.620]   years now this is you know part of Tim Cook and now Jeff Williams is brilliance
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.700]   where you know they they have all the parts kind of brought into wherever they
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.860]   need to be brought in they're assembled in a certain area where it's kind of
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.340]   like this almost like tax-free kind of jurisdiction place where they do the
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.580]   assembly and then they ship it out from another place you know it's it's just a
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:03.740]   you know a maze of loopholes to to make things as as cost efficient as possible
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.300]   and so yeah exactly it's not as if the stuff's not still gonna be made in in
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:12.420]   China it's just gonna be assembled in Vietnam similar to kind of India's been
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:16.180]   a little bit different but that was one of kind of the the first ways people
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.100]   were trying to get around some of the various Indian tariffs which was okay we
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:23.300]   will do everything but the final assembly in India and and be able to you
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.740]   know say that this was a made in India phone and he has made some other provisions
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.740]   that make that more difficult but yeah I mean this is what's gonna happen is
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:33.340]   China's still gonna be the hub but they just you know assemble in Indonesia or
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.900]   so the question is whether prices for these products will go up and I think in
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:40.220]   the case of Apple Minkchi quotes predicting and I think he's probably
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.740]   accurate at least initially Apple will absorb the cost there's enough margin in
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:49.020]   their products and I think that's a reflection of the that's a reflection of
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:51.940]   the political environment which is unpredictable we don't know if the
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:56.580]   tariffs are gonna come in or come off the way that the current US government is
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:00.860]   negotiating says something and then it un says it and then it comes back again
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:04.100]   and is using that as a negotiating tactic I'm not gonna comment on the
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:09.100]   politics I'm just saying this is where the situation is I think the challenge
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.300]   here too is also that a lot of these companies set up supply chains that are
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:17.540]   running just in time the car factories for example in the UK they carry four
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:22.060]   hours worth of stock and they literally have this consistent delivery cycle and
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:26.140]   the factories in that are working in China have the same thing so now if
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:30.820]   you're gonna pick up the goods and then tranship them from China to Vietnam
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:34.740]   for assembly to get to the US market what you have is a much more complex
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:40.380]   supply chain and your ability to react to your orders it matters less for Apple
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:44.460]   which is usually shipping in such volumes and has the money to have very
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:48.420]   strong discipline around the supply chain but in terms of enterprise IT where
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:52.620]   we're buying small numbers of high-value goods which is where I operate the risks
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.580]   are that you suddenly have a situation where the American market has products
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:01.340]   that are 15% more expensive and the supply chain is messy things aren't in
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:05.500]   stock or modules aren't in stock for short periods of time because they have
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:10.380]   to go through Vietnam to avoid the taxes or whatever and or you have some things
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:14.420]   which have extra costs out of balance with the other things so you buy a module
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:19.820]   that's not got the the tariff on it and then over here in Europe we have a
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:23.980]   different situation where we you know we pay VAT but we don't pay the tariffs
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:26.860]   and there's going to be an imbalance and the the market's going to shift you
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:32.060]   might see something that used to happen a lot when I was a young IT person where
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:36.820]   we would buy stuff in one company you know in our US operation and then get
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:41.060]   them afraid it out to us in Australia to bypass the taxes the tariffs yeah it
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:46.620]   is an interesting impact it's going to mess up the way that we buy goods from
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:51.300]   the consumer market and also in the business market yeah I was gonna say
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.900]   I mean if you open some some really interesting things you make great points
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:57.420]   about what'll happen enterprise IT I think in the consumer space I think at
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:00.660]   least in this short term I don't see prices going up but it really depends on
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:04.380]   how long this this goes on right because historically I know that Apple has
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:08.780]   actually both when there have been UK things and you know various you know
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:13.500]   like like taxes tariffs and and other back concerns also in Australia and
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:17.460]   and based on varying prices at the dollar where they've had higher prices
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.940]   there because of that so if you were to do like even just like the you know
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.820]   just the currency conversion the prices would still be on average higher and a
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:28.420]   lot of people in those countries would complain and you would see a lot of
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:31.660]   people like a lot of my UK friends would come to the US to buy their Apple
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:34.940]   products and then you know smuggled them you know through through through the
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:41.340]   airport and whatnot I could see it becomes a difficult political position
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:44.060]   for Apple but but I could see you know but it becomes one of those places where
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:49.900]   this becomes like if the administration is insistent on continuing this sort of
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.420]   trade we're going back and forth and making you know blunderous decisions
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:57.980]   and if these prices are at these tariffs are sustained companies like
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.540]   Apple could be considering saying okay well we're gonna have to raise our
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.060]   prices in the US and that makes a certain political statement too right I think
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:07.780]   they want I don't they won't change prices between now and Christmas into
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:12.340]   the holiday season because people are I agree with you I'm saying that's what
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.980]   I'm saying if it goes after that right I'm not like obviously I think for the
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:18.180]   next you know three or four months no but I'm saying if this were to continue
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:21.820]   afterwards then I could see a realignment and then you could almost you
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:26.300]   could see kind of the on the sub-political push to say well we have to
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:30.620]   raise prices because this this this and this because that has been something they
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:35.500]   you know tried to do in other countries before and in this case if enough big
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:42.060]   you know consumer brands values together against that that would be that
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.020]   would be a powerful kind of statement I guess I've got an interesting question
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:49.180]   for you what what's he gonna do with the 250 billion dollars in tariffs that he
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:55.140]   collects give it to the soybean farmers hmm yeah just I mean you could build a
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.820]   wall remember that it's attacks it's a tax and it goes to the government coffers
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:04.380]   I do wonder you know you're facing an election season here you know the
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.140]   government is going to have somewhere between a hundred and two hundred and fifty
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:12.960]   billion extra dollars in revenue that isn't a tax nominally but it is a
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.500]   tariff and you know whatever does seem it strikes me that this is something
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.740]   that could be used for various purposes I've just never seen anybody ask that
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:26.980]   question and I apparently Mar-a-Lago has bed bugs maybe they could get it
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:34.740]   now please now let's move on because it is often presumed that the iPhone is
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:40.540]   somehow magically more secure than Android devices and maybe it is but
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:48.900]   Project Zero at Google discovered a very interesting iOS exploit chain five
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:54.220]   separate complete and unique iPhone exploits covering every version of iOS
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:59.980]   from 10 to 12 the most recent version and these chains they discovered were
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:12.860]   being used by websites to hijack iPhones in drive-bys so and then there's some
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:17.740]   question about what these websites but according to the Google Project Zero
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:25.460]   blog they discovered sites have been using these chains for years to hack
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:32.860]   iPhones as they drive by a little bit later the next day tech crunch had this
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:40.820]   story sources say China use those iPhone hacks to target weger Muslims and that's
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:45.020]   an interesting use of this it was a state-based attack I don't know how many
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:50.220]   wegers are using iPhones and this was the same group that they were forcing when
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.700]   they were coming through the borders to install Android software that they could
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:57.140]   spy on them right that's right it's the same thing anybody was going into China
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:04.260]   in that area of China was compelled to install spyware on their phones I think
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:11.380]   this is you know an example of how these exploits are used I presume that Apple
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:18.340]   will button them up as soon as possible already yeah I'm assuming that if they've
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.660]   been you know like it's you know disclosed that they've already been
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:24.860]   patched but that's it's still really interesting project zero announced it
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:29.820]   after taking it to Apple yeah they did not they did not release the websites
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:33.020]   used in the attacks so there's really no way of knowing who was doing this but
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:37.580]   the researchers said the attacks were indiscriminate watering hole attacks in
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:44.020]   other words not targeted but tech crunch says they have evidence otherwise one of
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:46.980]   the sources told tech crunch the websites infected non-weagers who
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:51.620]   inadvertently access those domains prompting the FBI to alert Google
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:57.100]   to ask for the site to be removed from its index to prevent infections so some
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:03.940]   leak on this I did you know it's a fairly sophisticated attack requires
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:10.460]   chain daisy chaining a variety of exploits one after the other I think I
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:13.900]   think that I think the interesting part I think that struck me about this is
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.780]   although it's fairly shocking to find a series like there's a half a dozen
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:24.420]   zero-day vulnerabilities attached here is that it must not have been widely
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:29.740]   propagated or impacted people or it would have come to light sooner so they
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:33.300]   must have kept it very much on the quiet and even though it was a watering hole
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:38.260]   they must not have widely spread it if that makes sense because if it people
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:43.300]   would have seen it if it had have gotten into the white into a mass outbreak it
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:47.900]   kind of lends credence to the thought that it's probably not a watering hole
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:53.220]   attack but targeted yeah I was gonna say
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:59.500]   go ahead go ahead Craig yeah a watering hole attack is that the website is
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:03.260]   there and people would come to it the point is that you have to generate people
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:07.140]   have to know about the watering hole to hit it and these are semi-random web
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:11.100]   the hinted in the Google blog post is these are not websites that you and I
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.860]   would go to you would have to have a specific reason for going to them so in
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:18.420]   the sense that it's a watering hole attack in that it's just an open website
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:21.580]   but you still got to get people to come to the watering hole after no watering
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:26.180]   holes there in fact in the zero day likely a honey pot right honey pot more
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:30.580]   than a watering hole the project zero blog does imply that they say real
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:34.340]   users make risk decisions based on the public perception of the security of
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:38.420]   these devices there's definitely a widespread perception that after devices
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:43.420]   are somehow magically more secure even Phil Zimmerman the creator PGP says I
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:47.700]   can't use an Android device is not safe that's why I use an iPhone but Google
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.820]   points out the reality remains security protections will never eliminate the
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:57.500]   risk of attack and this is the important part if you're being targeted to be
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:01.860]   targeted might simply mean being born in a certain geographic region or being
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.580]   part of a certain ethnic group all that users can do is be conscious of the
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:10.580]   fact that mass exploitation still exists and behave accordingly treating their
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:15.340]   mobile devices is both integral to their modern lives yet also as devices which
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:19.180]   when compromise can upload their every action into a database to be
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:22.300]   potentially used against them those are kind of chilling words go ahead
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.220]   Christiane know what I was going to say is what's so interesting to this to me
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.620]   is when you look at these various chains and you see the OS versions and you see
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:32.940]   like what models are impacted like it really does kind of like that the time
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:38.100]   period the vector where it is potentially available gets shorter and shorter so
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.500]   by the time you get to chain five for instance you have a fairly limited
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:48.420]   window but it's still you know you're not talking about like the old model
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:51.980]   phones right which is typically what we see in even these targeted attacks
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:56.180]   where you where what we've you know kind of told people and obviously if you're
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:59.180]   being if you are being targeted for a reason it's a little bit different ball
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:02.860]   game but the general advice we give to people regardless of what mobile
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:07.660]   operating system you use is to to get the latest updates and and Apple users
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:11.220]   tend to be better than most you know updating their their software and getting
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:14.540]   the latest versions more quickly but what's what's really kind of I guess
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.740]   scary to me about this is you look at this and you see how quickly they're
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:23.540]   able to get these other chains up to you know impact the other devices that are
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:28.940]   that are on the market so that they can continue to do those exploits it's
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:33.580]   also interesting because you know the the iOS the jailbreaking community has
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:38.420]   basically died down because it's been really hard to kind of exploit things
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:42.780]   with the exception of China like where all the active kind of activity in
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:47.340]   jailbreaking still remains is in China and that I don't think is the
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:50.460]   coincidence and I think that obviously you have two different sides there you
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.140]   have some people who are enthusiasts and are trying to do things for their own
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.620]   purposes and maybe you know creating malware for other purposes then you do
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:01.100]   also have I think the idea that maybe you have state sponsored or targeted you
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:06.740]   know attacks that might be done that might be not as widespread as as we see
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:12.740]   here in the Western world because they're that's that's just where a lot of
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:17.740]   that you know kind of reverse engineering is really become concentrated
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:21.900]   at this point which is a big financial effort very financial effort in China
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:26.620]   people will find paying five dollars ten dollars twenty US dollars for an app
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:31.220]   very difficult and so there's a substantial effort over there to break
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:35.340]   apps or to sideload apps onto your phone so that you don't have to pay for
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:41.380]   them and yes so there is also just a straight out cultural issue where in a
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.980]   country where you know twenty US dollars is a substantial amount of money
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:49.100]   sidejacking or sideloading or hacking your iPhone or breaking your iPhone is
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:55.300]   to highly desirable well the good news is Apple was made aware of these problems
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:59.180]   Google says we reported these issues to Apple with a seven day deadline usually
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:04.420]   there's a 90 day deadline a seven day deadline the first day of February which
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:09.780]   is why you may have noticed an out of band iPhone patch on February 7th that
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:16.540]   was 12.1.4 and so the good news is yes as you pointed out these have been
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:21.900]   patched the bad news is that they existed for years yes but again if they had
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.540]   have existed for years we would have seen and they were being exploited
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:28.540]   widely right we would have seen that right and or somebody would have the
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:33.460]   general the reasonable assumption is we would have noticed and it would have
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:37.540]   been discovered that's not to say that nobody got infected or that people were
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:42.460]   not no one got compromised is just to say it's not a massive risk I suspect I
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:45.540]   mean it's probably you're probably right in seeing that it's not a massive risk I
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:49.420]   do think though that it's something that we should be considering not just you
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.420]   know looking at China but looking at other nations including the United
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:56.860]   States where you know it is very common where you will have security
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:01.300]   organizations things like the CIA who will hoard zero days and will have
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:06.100]   vulnerabilities they might have access to for years to to access things and just
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:10.660]   because we don't see widespread uses of it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:15.740]   so to me you know looking at this and seeing that this exists makes me think
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:18.900]   there are probably more of these things out there not just for iPhone but for
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:24.260]   other very popular devices as well that we don't know about because by design
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:31.420]   they are being hoarded and they're probably hoarded by nation states yes
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:37.100]   and in this case it looks like maybe by China to target we're with your
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:42.700]   Muslims in China I mean in during the Apple versus FBI case the CIA you know
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:47.700]   it was it was said in testimony by by people that you know the story zero days
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:51.620]   yes precisely and and that you know because one of the big questions was why
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:55.220]   can't you do this and one of the arguments from many experts was well hey
[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:59.260]   you know ask the CIA they have access to a lot of this stuff so in a way this is
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:03.020]   interesting because yes it was it sounds like it was in fact a targeted
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:08.780]   attack but it could have been a watering hole attack had had the this government
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:12.460]   decided to use it that way but as is often the case with governments they
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:18.700]   keep it secret so that they can use it in targeted important surgical way one
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.860]   of the interesting things is there's websites out there like virus total
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:26.300]   which cat you know where you they have a list of known malware or no one attacks
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:30.020]   and what's happening now is the government you know the UK government
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:33.820]   European governments and the US governments once they know that the cyber
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:37.740]   weapons if you want to go with the terminology has been compromised or they
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.100]   know that their opponent has a particular weapon they'll upload it to virus
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:45.980]   total so that the the weapon is dead right so once it's exposed and everybody
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:50.140]   knows about it so we are seeing a much more mature attitude once upon a time
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:53.420]   they would never have released it until somebody in the community found it and
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:56.540]   then it would have been burned now what they're saying is well if our opponents
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:00.220]   have it we might as well burn it so nobody has it so there there is a very
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:03.820]   much a that whole security industry is very difficult to discuss because it's
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:07.500]   very nuanced attribution is very difficult because you don't actually know
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.940]   like for example because Google hasn't given us the web so it's we can't draw
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:14.980]   conclusions that they as watering holes are they watering holes or are they
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:18.740]   honeypots because if we could see that they were specifically targeted with
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.940]   content for a particular audience that you asserted that that might have been
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:25.660]   the we go as in China it could be you know they could be using the same thing
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:28.780]   for people in Hong Kong for what we know it could have been whoever could have
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:32.220]   been the Russians targeting people in Eastern Europe in Ukraine there's an
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:35.940]   undeclared wall going on in Eastern Ukraine still so until we know those
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:39.340]   sites you can't state with any certainty that a watering hole tack or
[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:43.220]   honeypot tack but quite honestly when it comes to security I'm much more worried
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:48.380]   about conferences and where people go who have measles you see that there was
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:55.140]   an actual virus spreading through a black hat it's something called measles
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:24:01.420]   oh my god yeah apparently somebody attended black hat was actually in the
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:08.020]   infectious nature so as somebody who travels a lot and somebody who I used to
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:11.500]   go to a lot of conferences and now I don't this is one of the reasons why I've
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:16.020]   stopped because this is actually a problem so Van Pazal in New Zealand has
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:21.060]   800 cases of measles in that town now that's a that is the capital of New Zealand
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.940]   but New Zealand only has a population of three million they are actually
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:33.500]   saying oh my god 800 cases like vaccinate it's oh this is so frustrating
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:39.500]   we don't know if the the vector the patient zero the measles carrier was
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:43.580]   there for black hat but it happened during black hat and in particularly two
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:49.580]   restaurants inside Mandalay Bay Lupo and Oriol if you ate there
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:54.860]   yeah another reason I was a good Las Vegas right like seriously oh come on I mean
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:25:01.220]   I'm sorry I'm sorry you've had your shots I have I have and in fact I'm going to
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:06.740]   protect you what they're not gonna put them though if you I don't protect you
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:11.700]   now you are a US adult you haven't had measles measles shot in years or beyond
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:15.900]   yeah yeah hasn't been has hadn't gotten a booster since you're a child yeah you
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:20.460]   are not necessarily still immune I know I got one as a big scare when I went to
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:24.680]   college what and they forced us all to get re-enzels shots because to get
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.820]   measles shots so actually I had the shot but I also had measles so aren't I
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:35.860]   doubly protect you probably okay so I have my mister I have I'm so old we got
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:42.300]   measles in my day you got it keep telling me I've had mumps measles German
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:47.420]   measles chicken pox I've had them all because they didn't I had I had had my
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:51.580]   booster I 1995 and so according to what of the date was like mine is still good
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:56.740]   but yes I know but because I'm paranoid when I got the yellow fever or whatever
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.380]   the whatever the thing was the first time I went to Brazil I had to get some
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:06.900]   sort of shot I went ahead and got a booster why not give everything so get
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:10.420]   it all anyway I just I think it's interesting because we depend in the
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:15.300]   technology industry we like to flock to these conferences and to instead of
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:19.500]   just like using the internet like real people but anyway I wonder if this could
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:23.060]   have a lock yourself in a room you need one of those bubble boy outfits and
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:26.940]   never go out you're safe well yeah look at this look at what we're doing right
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:31.460]   here this is this is this is a measles free event right now except for those
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:36.020]   studio audience members where are you guys from
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.740]   are you it's just interesting to think about the ramifications of that if that
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:43.460]   continues to get out I think you're getting that grower phobic come on get
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:46.660]   out there it's good for you expose yourself to germs that's you want a
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:53.140]   strong immune system yes well perhaps I show today brought to you by last pass
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:57.700]   hey October 3rd we're gonna be in Boston Steve Gibson and I are gonna do an
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:03.940]   event with last passes see so and the legendary Bill Cheswick the guy who
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:07.500]   invented the firewall at Bell Labs and and we're gonna be talking about
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:13.060]   authentication the problem with passwords it's gonna be a lot of fun more
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:17.700]   details about that event to come last passes are hosting of course nobody
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:23.140]   knows better the problems with passwords and last passes really the cure to many
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:28.340]   password problems someday we won't need passwords but we live today when we do
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:32.860]   lots of them for lots of sites lots of apps and of course the number one risk
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:37.580]   with passwords is reusing passwords actually the probably number one risk is
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:42.100]   using monkey one two three is your password then you compound it by using
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:46.860]   monkey one two three on every site you visit now you're real now you're really
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:53.100]   in trouble last pass protects people with a great password fault that's fully
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:57.700]   encrypted only decrypted on your device it runs everywhere you are first thing
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:01.260]   I install when I set up a new phone I set up a new computer whether I'm using
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:05.980]   Linux windows or Mac I install last pass because all my passwords are in it all
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:09.300]   you have to do is remember a master password and here at Twitter we use
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:15.700]   last pass enterprise because we know people are people they do silly things
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:19.460]   with their passwords and in this case our employees have passwords to the most
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:23.540]   important things in our business our bank accounts our websites our databases
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:27.460]   and if they're gonna have access to those I want to make sure we're giving a
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:31.300]   access in a safe sane way last pass enterprise is getting better they just
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:35.700]   set up an expanded business lineup with some amazing features that will do
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:39.100]   something that normally in security is impossible it'll make you more secure
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:43.820]   and your users will have more convenience how is that possible well let me
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:49.100]   explain last pass enterprise is now using single sign-on for 1200 plus
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:52.620]   sample integrated apps and and you don't have to worry about training because
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:56.260]   each has its own getting started guide so it's very easy for your users to set
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:29:01.940]   it up the nice thing about single sign-on is they don't even use passwords you
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:05.900]   just do an approval on their phone and it's all good to go I love this Google
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.860]   and Microsoft has started using this now you can extend it to over 1200 apps in
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:14.540]   your in your business they're also doing something I really like called
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:18.220]   multi-factor authentication it leverages biometrics like your face or
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:23.460]   fingerprint plus contextual factors like location or IP address it goes beyond
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:28.380]   what to factor can do to really guarantee that the people who are using your
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:32.100]   stuff are the people you expect to be using your stuff true authentication
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:37.420]   with last pass MFA they call it last pass identity it combines LP last pass
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:41.940]   enterprise with last pass MFA from single sign-on and password management to
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:46.900]   adaptive authentication last pass is great for the IT department and it's
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:53.300]   great for users frictionless access all in one simple secure solution I put
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:56.580]   everything in last pass including by the way my social security number my
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:00.940]   passport when I travel I you know they used to say bring a copy your
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:05.140]   passport I do but it's in last pass so it's super safe super secure but I've
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:09.540]   got it wherever I go and of course it's great for online shopping last pass will
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:12.660]   fill in the credit card number automatically fill in your address book
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:17.180]   don't trust it to your browser that's not secure trust it to last pass we use
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:21.140]   last pass enterprise at Twitter I use last pass families at home I'm very
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:25.260]   excited about the steps last pass is taking to take us into the 21st century
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:30.220]   beyond passwords I think you will too from authentication to access to
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:34.260]   passwords last pass manages every entry point to your business so you can
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.980]   mitigate risk while improving employee productivity we're big fans I know you
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:44.740]   will be to learn more at last pass dot com slash tweet last pass dot com slash
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:48.180]   Twitter maybe the single sign on and you know this is so easy I think a lot of
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:52.500]   people be using it it's just a great way to go I love it so you posted a little
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.620]   something I think this is going to stimulate some conversation from the
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:02.940]   electronic frontier foundation don't play in Google's privacy sandbox Google
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:08.860]   has been modifying Chrome significantly to make it safer but one thing they don't
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:16.140]   want to get rid of is cookies and this is kind of controversial cookies
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:23.460]   especially third-party cookies are the number one tracking technology but but
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:28.740]   Google says blocking third-party cookies which every other browser does
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:34.740]   will hurt user privacy it's gonna break it's terrible because instead you know
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:40.300]   it actually it's kind of I've got to get them credit their rationalization is
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:45.180]   sort of brilliant it's complete BS in my opinion but is EFF calls it privacy
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:50.780]   gaslighting oh it is it's sort of brilliant because what they're saying is
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:55.380]   they're like if you block these third-party trackers which are so invasive in
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:59.260]   this and that even more invasive trackers like fingerprinting and pixels and
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:04.300]   this and that will be used so please let's use this thing that we we know and
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:09.020]   accept is is bad but that we can block it and not these other things they're
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:15.180]   much harder to it could be worse it is security gaslighting it is it is
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:19.780]   hilarious but I have to get them credit like I mean I personally as I said my
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.660]   opinion only and I'm speaking for myself I'm not speaking for any employers or
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:26.940]   anybody else this is just me speaking I think it's total BS but I also I have to
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:31.180]   kind of applaud them and be like you know what I that argument it's a good spot
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:39.180]   they really it's outright evil it is it is outright anti-vax this is this is
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:44.900]   literally anti-vaxing on browsers taking a tiny little fuck you know claim of
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:48.620]   truth and blowing it into the entire truth and ignoring all the false puts
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:53.660]   around it's absolutely taking privacy and turning it into anti-vax and saying you
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:58.300]   don't want privacy because you know blah blah blah the good news is you have a
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:02.500]   choice I mean there are very good I use Firefox which not only blocks third
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:05.980]   party cookies but also attempts to block fingerprinting I don't know how
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:11.420]   complete its blocking is but it's built in there I always turn off the trackers
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:16.620]   like the Facebook like button and the Twitter sign in there's lots of things
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:20.620]   you can do to improve your privacy online and I also understand the Google
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:26.140]   which is the world's largest ad agency doesn't want to do too much of it's
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:30.220]   actually not Google in this case it's Google's customers customers so
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:35.220]   kirbyl who go up to Google's ad system they use that to track you as you move
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:40.420]   around the web and if so if you go and read the web kit security policy or the
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:43.660]   Mozilla security policy I put some links in the show notes there they are
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:48.580]   actually state quite clearly that they are going to take active steps to block
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:53.300]   tracking they are actively going after anti-tracking they will block cross-site
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:57.580]   tracking so this idea that you go to the verge and they lay down cookies for
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:01.980]   about 40 or 50 sites in your browser and then you go to another one and those
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:06.540]   cookies track you as you go around the web it's a combination of one pixel
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:10.180]   cookie and all this sort of stuff we know all about that and they ID you and
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:14.300]   then if you suddenly go from the verge to a store and you put something in the
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:19.660]   in the the cart but then you walk away and go to another site then they contact
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:23.300]   you and say you've left this in the car why don't you come back and buy it or
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:28.140]   they track you as you go from a review site and those review sites live you know
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:33.780]   live by these well that's okay so there is an issue here which is a lot of the
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:40.700]   web is monetized this way a lot of the web is free because of that isn't it the
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:45.060]   case that we've we break too many of these systems that I mean I know sites
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:48.620]   are going out of business right and left totally but in the sense that people
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:54.020]   don't know the problem is that the ordinary human doesn't understand where
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:59.140]   the money pays for that review and they don't understand that it's like when you
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:03.300]   go to a car yard you negotiate with a car dealer to buy a car you know where
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:06.260]   the Commission is and you know where the money's coming from when you go to a
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:10.140]   review site ordinary people don't understand that these people are maybe
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:13.300]   making recommendations on the bunch on the back of the fact that they're getting
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:19.700]   a spear or a kickback right in the the amount of monitoring it's like if people
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:22.740]   knew that when you walked into Walmart and then you went around the road to
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:26.060]   the target and then you went around the road to the next shop and the next shop
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:29.780]   and each one of those shops knew exactly where you went in each store and every
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:32.940]   item that you picked up they would be horrified and that's exactly what's
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:36.300]   happening on the web and well we go ahead Christian go ahead Christian
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:40.620]   well I was gonna say what you just described was beacons which is something
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:44.940]   that they you know come in the real world Apple supports beacons all of
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:49.180]   Apple's devices beacon which I was surprised to learn and I beacon is a
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:53.500]   thing and big stores do it I mean this is they're very much if they could do
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:59.100]   that they were trying to oh there are active industries like you know sub
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:03.500]   industries within you know like a retail that are dedicated strictly to that
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:09.460]   purpose and so if they can get people to do that they they would and and I agree
[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:13.460]   with Greg to certain extent the people be horrified I also think that it's one of
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:17.340]   those issues where we're in this place right now which I think is really good
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.820]   where people are getting freaked out about privacy for good reasons and the
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:24.820]   pendulum has swung for 10 years or so everybody was pretty willing to just be
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:28.460]   like a whatever and now people are getting really freaked out about it I
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:33.660]   do think that it's important in some cases to be understanding about and I'm
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:37.460]   not saying this is what Google is doing it all because I actually in
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:40.740]   disagreement with with their rationalizations but understanding the
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:43.540]   differences between things like first-party cookies and third-party cookies
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:47.580]   and and I'm not going to take a hardlining value and say that all analytics
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:50.660]   and all tracking and all its telemetry is bad because I that would make me
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:54.260]   hypocrite you know my past life as a journalist knowing how many people you
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:57.860]   were to know what the national will massively exist because it was free
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:01.700]   absolutely well and in advertising you know some of its direct ideals some of
[01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:05.580]   its other things but even beyond that like knowing what people click on knowing
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:09.700]   what people like knowing what content is doing what that's valuable information
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:12.860]   now I personally even for my own personal websites I would like to know
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:16.540]   that I don't need to know any information about the people themselves I
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.220]   don't want to have something that's linked to some profile that could be
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:23.780]   personally identical information right but it's not I'm not going to make an
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:27.540]   argument that said that where I'm going to be hypocrite and say it's not useful
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:31.500]   for me to know what countries people visiting my website come from or what
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.660]   continent there's a difference between first-party analytics and third-party
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:40.260]   analytics I really want to research this a little further and what I've discovered
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:43.780]   is that there are businesses out there building business intelligence on
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:49.020]   companies by tracking their employees as they move around the web yes so yes so
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:51.940]   one of the issues that I'd like to draw to people's attention is that if your
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:56.260]   company uses Chrome you're actually giving information to your competitors
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:38:00.980]   about what's happening inside of your car because I can target you and see
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:05.420]   what your purchasing up department is buying I can go monitor what your IT
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:08.300]   how would you get that information where do you get that you buy it from
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:12.900]   somebody yeah you buy it from a third party so there was a great ours
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:18.700]   Technica in a kind of co-investigation there was a guy he made he kind of a
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:24.140]   he was an ISP and he discovered that he was seeing weird data logs and he did
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:27.380]   some investigations and found out that there was this third-party company they
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:30.620]   even been on product kind of stuff where they were basically selling a Google
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.700]   analytics dashboard where people could see their competitors and they could see
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:39.180]   like what their internal Google analytics stuff looked like and they were doing
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:43.540]   this because they were very popular Google Chrome extensions where people
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:48.140]   would opt in and by opting in it just means clicking whatever dialogue would
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:52.820]   come up when the extension was installed to letting any of their data go across
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:56.780]   but a lot of the information was personally identifiable they claim that
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:39:00.580]   they were scrubbing that information but it wasn't I'm gonna find the link and
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:06.020]   put it in the IRC but yeah I mean there are but like Greg is saying there are
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:10.460]   our whole industries involved with selling this sort of information that
[01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:15.780]   people can get either through extensions or third-party trackers or other things
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:21.020]   and I do agree with you so you remember the debt collection thing that happened
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:25.700]   a month or two ago and they were able to find anybody anywhere there's exactly
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.580]   the same business as debt collectors and except they're tracking what companies
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:31.980]   are doing and then selling that information to your competitor so if
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:35.940]   you're a company using Chrome today you are literally giving your competitors
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.700]   information on what your business is doing if you're in a business that's
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:43.060]   competitive well and that is that is the that is why you should be switching to
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:50.420]   WebKit which is Safari Safari what do you use as a browser Greg I run Safari
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:56.060]   most of the day and then I have a special Firefox hack which every time I shut
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:59.780]   Firefox it wipes all the cookies everything inside of it so if I'm running
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:03.440]   to a site where I'm not quite safe I fork to Firefox fork the link to
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:09.420]   Firefox and that I use Firefox focus on my iPhone and Android phone this does
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:15.260]   that every time you use it it you could flush everything out all the tracking
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:19.820]   cookies everything after you use it I think that's a nice choice I am on
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:22.940]   all iPhone so I'm using WebKit so I feel fairly safe but it's just nice to
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:27.780]   have that as a choice of course on Android I do the switch here is that
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:32.020]   everybody but Google is switching to an anti-tracking policy that's why Google
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:36.580]   is doing this we should be very clear they're seeing Safari and WebKit move in
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:40.700]   this direction anti-tracking technologies Firefox does it brave does it I bet
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:44.980]   you I seem to remember when Microsoft said we're gonna start using the Chromium
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:48.780]   engine for edge they said but we're gonna strip out all that tracking stuff
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:53.020]   right yeah I mean to be clear and because it's still in betas and in one of the
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:56.380]   beta actually just came out and I've actually been using the the Chrome
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:00.300]   since it was just in Canary and I like it a whole lot or not Chrome edge I like
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:05.260]   it a whole lot but I use Safari as well but I primarily these days use the edge
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:09.900]   browser there is some telemetry and there is some Microsoft syncing it's not
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:13.820]   the same extended Google stuff but I don't know the details about how all of
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:18.300]   that works because maybe somebody can find out for us and let us know and we
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:22.060]   can publish something on that I think it's very interesting that good
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:25.700]   I know the team is committed to trying to be to follow some of the same
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:30.620]   guidelines that Mozilla and WebKit have put out but you can according to first
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:36.260]   post you can enable through experimental flags in the new edge you can enable
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:40.380]   tracking protection and very much like Firefox they have three choices basic
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:47.020]   balanced and strict and so you can turn on strict tracking protection sounds
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:50.220]   like it's doing very much the same thing Firefox is doing yeah I think it's
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:53.540]   following the same guidelines I think that the balance is the default one but
[01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:57.140]   you know those things could change by the time the final you know I'm sorry I
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:42:00.940]   think this make a little bit make sense you can show it here Carson I'm
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:04.540]   kind of on my screen I think it kind of makes sense which is for most people
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:07.980]   you know you don't want to break their experience of the web if they know what
[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:13.100]   they're doing they can make it more strict I certainly go into and Firefox
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:18.260]   starts with a less extreme it's very similar to Firefox is tracking yeah
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:23.340]   this is this is an intent to change future versions of Firefox to be actively
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:27.220]   hostile it'll move to the strict as a default but it'll be progressive so that
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:32.140]   nothing breaks over time or in an attempt to manage what my I mean I already
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:36.300]   have a problem today with my ad blocking settings and my outbound filters and
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:39.260]   so forth there's a lot of websites that just don't work well isn't that going to
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:42.980]   be the real problem is that soon websites will just reject you if you do any kind
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:46.420]   of I was gonna say this becomes the thing although what's really interesting and
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.660]   Greg I'd like to know your thoughts on this and this obviously becomes very
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:53.660]   geeky but this is the sort of thing that could be productized very very easily
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:58.020]   where you see people you know creating like a Raspberry Pi holes where they're
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:01.140]   creating you know kind of like ad blocking like at the DNS at like the
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:05.900]   router level which is much harder to because yeah you do have the issue where
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:09.980]   websites will just break if you are running you know tracking your turn off
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:13.740]   tracking or if you have ad blockers running but if you're blocking things
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:19.100]   that kind of like the the requests level a lot of times it does things are
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:23.980]   still able to get through so it'll be interesting I think if if somebody if
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.740]   they haven't already a way to productize you know because it's it's a fairly
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:32.780]   simple process a set of a pie hole somebody let me stop there are some
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:36.460]   people doing that googles ahead of you there they've already invented a
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:41.100]   protocol called DNS over HTTPS it's been ratified by the ITF it's nearly
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:45.540]   complete through the standards process and a future version of Chrome will
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:49.580]   actually use that won't use your computers DNS it will actually use an
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:53.980]   internal setting to the app and it'll make its DNS queries directly to Google's
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:58.860]   DNS and you will never be up so pie hole will die and you won't be able to
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:02.460]   filter well they'll die if you're using Chrome I'm using Firefox which also uses
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:08.980]   HTTPS over DNS but uses you cloud flares 1.1.1 DNS and I trust cloud
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:12.420]   yeah I was gonna say what if you're using like a cloud flare or what's the
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.660]   other one quad nine there are a couple of other like privacy focused DNS things
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:21.740]   so I mean I hear what you're saying but I do wonder like I think DNS over HTTPS
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:25.380]   is a good thing though right on balance if you were forced to use Google that
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:30.180]   would be different but because I don't use Google I think that's it that's a
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:34.620]   good thing it's a balancing act here there's now my eye it's protecting from
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:40.020]   your ISP so I've just spent five days researching DNS over HTTPS and getting
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:43.300]   inside of all the issues and got a head full of stuff that so stop me if I get
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:47.980]   a little bit so the idea was is that a lot most DNS queries are in the clear
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:53.260]   and anybody can capture them your ISP or any you know and then a lot of services
[01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:56.900]   actually use that metadata and sell it for money so a lot of ISPs force you to
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:01.540]   use their DNS server and then they sell the DNS data and a lot of companies
[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:06.020]   have since got up and said so companies like Cisco bought open DNS so that they
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:09.660]   can get the security data so now they get the analytics data streaming off that
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:13.700]   part of the reason a Google created its DNS and cloud flare has its DNS they
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:18.100]   might say it's good at the world no you know but it's actually analytics data
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:21.220]   that drives them they get to know what's happening on the web they can also find
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:25.340]   malware and spyware and sites that are set up that are otherwise so there is
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:29.420]   some good but the challenge here is to encrypt DNS we have a number of things
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:34.860]   DNS sec won't ever get legs because it's too hard no any form of PKI with a
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:38.860]   route to you know tree infrastructure means the route becomes a single
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:43.540]   forward point of failure and becomes a key weakness and we keep trying to work
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:48.500]   with DNS second it's just never gonna go DNS over HTTPS means that the DNS
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:52.860]   query gets embedded in HTTPS and all of a sudden inspection engines that look for
[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:56.860]   that data will stop working now what I want you to think about is when something
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:01.980]   like the Facebook app on the iOS has that DNS over HTTP built in so you never
[01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:05.580]   see the Facebook DNS queries that's a whole filtering mechanism that's
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:09.700]   suddenly cut off or people start building JavaScript apps in web pages that do
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:14.740]   DNS lookups in JavaScript so that maybe uses your local DNS and that's that's
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:19.380]   good in the sense that my metadata the DNS lookup I have is no longer available
[01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:25.580]   to somebody in the network but we're also in a situation where our my client my
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:30.380]   DNS queries are no longer under my control and also the servers become
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:35.700]   centralized so cloud flare Google and the challenge that I have is that Google
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:41.540]   and cloud flare aren't actually good people they're all what I call printers
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:44.740]   of privacy that is they've got their version of privacy but they don't have a
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:48.340]   common version of privacy so we actually you know Matthew Prince says I just
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:51.420]   woke up this morning and decided to kick 8th gen off the internet well it
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:55.420]   shouldn't be his choice there should be some you know maybe that's topic we
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:47:02.260]   can stop yeah you you want to let's encrypt of DNS basically so I want a
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:08.300]   policy that's the real solution is have an ISP you trust yeah this is true no
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:13.340]   there's no nice piece no I trust sonic net that's our ISP I know because I trust
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:18.500]   we've G and I know that sonic net is not not harvesting or using my DNS
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:24.220]   queries but they're all but they're only a text right if I'm monitoring them
[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:27.980]   upstream like the reason you don't see it upstream do you you if I get that
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:33.180]   query satisfied by by sonic net I don't you don't see it upstream only upstream
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:37.980]   resolve is also leak data yeah but if there's no upstream resolve if it gets
[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:44.060]   solved downstream I don't go upstream do I well yeah the cash has to be refreshed
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:47.460]   and if it's not in the local resolver cash it goes up to the root server I
[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:51.980]   understand anything that goes beyond the ISP is out in the public but but most of
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:56.300]   the time your server your your queries are cached unless you're going strange
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:00.100]   places but maybe those are the places you most want to protect yourself against
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:05.180]   so yeah what can I set up my own DNS server because this this is firefox's
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:08.540]   settings it's in the general under network settings at the very bottom I
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:13.380]   could turn on DNS over HTTPS the default provider is cloudflare but I
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:16.620]   could set up a custom provider I'd have to just know enough to set up a custom
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:23.140]   security DNS provider or perhaps use a third party that I trust yes so bind
[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:29.740]   will have a it has a DNS over HTTPS or doe doe H we say by the way they're not
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:33.940]   canonical either if if they don't have the DNS record they're still gonna send
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.940]   it in the clear to the canonical servers aren't they and they're working on that
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:43.140]   at the moment because it's not DNS all it's not HTTPS all the way no it's only
[01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:47.580]   between you and the DNS server which is a start right it's an iteration with
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:51.020]   the DNS protocol was built in a day when mass surveillance wasn't possible and
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:54.940]   wasn't even imagined right so the the situation that we live in today is very
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:59.020]   different so you know baby steps baby steps you know if you want to get back to
[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:03.260]   is it Microsoft never changed from where it was to say encourage people to
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:08.180]   change whereas the ISOC the internet society and consortium and the people
[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:12.740]   that run the internet backbone are saying we need to change DNS and there'll
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:16.740]   be another did I talk to you about the DNS flag day earlier this year yeah yeah
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:24.420]   yeah that's another one next year actually you really want your blood
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:27.120]   pressure to go up Christina don't listen to this you really want your
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.980]   pressure to go up here's a proposal and again it's from the Trump White House
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:37.620]   so you never know how much of this is sincere but to use stuff like your fit
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:43.340]   bit data to predict violent behavior yes we have a big we have a big problem
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:48.660]   there was yet another mass shooting last night and and and by the way any time
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:52.620]   you listen to this show that's probably gonna be true sad to say in this country
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:58.220]   I'm devastated to have to say that but there's a new proposal the health
[01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:04.220]   advanced research projects agency Harper is is a new agency proposed agency
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:09.020]   they'll be in HHS HHS and they want to they want to adopt something that's got
[01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:14.100]   a very long acronym called safe home stopping aberrant fatal events by
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:19.700]   helping overcome mental extremes they presented at the White House last week
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:25.300]   they want to use volunteer data to identify neuro behavioral signs of
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:30.780]   someone headed toward a violent explosive act everybody would be a
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:39.620]   volunteer and the data well it come from your fit bit or your other health
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:44.540]   device that that way we you know everybody has to wear one because otherwise
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:50.820]   the bad guys could get away with it so I we are you know I don't think this is
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:54.700]   going anywhere obviously obviously not this violate so many civil liberties
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:51:00.700]   job yeah yeah I mean genuinely this is like although like violation of both
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:04.900]   according to the Washington Post this is being one of the proposals the
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:12.700]   supporters is Bob Wright the former NBC chair okay Robert Wright so he's got
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:19.500]   some clout I'm just saying you can easily see a future where this kind of
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:23.500]   government surveillance in all different areas becomes the norm and when
[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:26.740]   there always will happen is out of fear we got to solve this problem it's
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:30.580]   terrible problem and we are all terrified that we can't walk down the
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:34.780]   street anymore without getting shot so everybody's got to wear a special fit
[01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:38.620]   bit yep you've got to think of the children think of the children yeah I
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:41.380]   got to think of the children totally prevent gun gun violence because all
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:45.580]   you need to do is is track everyone who's going to the gun store to buy no no
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:52.300]   that we can't do that that would be wrong that would be wrong no we track
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:55.500]   your heart rate we can't track your visits to the gun store that would be
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:52:00.380]   wrong simple that's how the Democrats get the Democrats behind the
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:05.700]   is tell them by the way I love it that after the president tweeted a
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:14.420]   surveillance image of Iran the folks at Reddit got together to figure out where
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:20.900]   it was and how it came from came to be and and the whole genesis of it
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:25.460]   Reddit's kind of amazing whether this is real or not doesn't matter I just it's
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:29.220]   just incredible to read these read it's apparently it is so apparently they
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:34.180]   it's a really did it they tracked they tracked the angle and it was it tracked
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:39.620]   to a satellite spy satellite which was known to be in that orbit and then I
[01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:43.100]   watched a video from Scott Manley on YouTube who actually unpacked it all
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:48.020]   and he was saying that the amazing thing about this is even though this is an
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:53.140]   picture of a screen he says that it looks like somebody held a smartphone up to
[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:56.740]   his computer screen and took a photo of it yeah because the black part of the
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:02.740]   upper left where it says top secret do not reveal to anyone under panel needed
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:06.900]   that that's that's kind of cut off there so apparently this is a 10 centimeter
[01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:12.180]   resolution whereas the previously what is 40 centimeters yes oh so you just
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:17.660]   basically burned the new spy satellite yes exactly and that's why people are
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:25.340]   that's 10 centimeter resolution yes apparently so yeah holy cow well now we
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:30.820]   know that thanks to Reddit some of the some of the best research being done
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:34.620]   today done by an anonymous amazing what they can calculate from a photo they
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:39.060]   can calculate the shadow so they know the angle and then they go and look at where
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:42.740]   the angle was from and then they go yeah that's a non-spy satellite it would
[01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:48.860]   have been in that location at that time and just like yeah just amazing amazing
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:52.820]   science going on behind that to decode it let's take a break we're gonna wrap
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:56.820]   this up we have a great panel I mean and it's the smallest panel we ever have
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:54:00.940]   which is three people but and I don't really count because it's Greg Faro and
[01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:05.780]   Christina I just you guys are fantastic I love having you on Greg Faro is of

[01:57:55.300 --> 01:58:01.620]   little mini epic movie all about the week that happened this week on Twitter
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:07.780]   previously on Twitter sure he felt very entitled to it yeah even though he was
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:13.380]   probably being paid a butt ton of money a butt ton that are new measurement that's
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:18.620]   that's one of my favorite words it's 53 Cardi B's I believe
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:24.220]   triangulation for a certain group of people and I include myself
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:31.220]   Randall Monroe is the geeks cartoonist I hope that's okay to say an XKCD at XKCD
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:37.940]   calm is a must read this weekend enterprise tech instead of asking on
[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:45.620]   Prem hybrid private cloud via more 2019 said yes all of those things all about
[01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:51.740]   Android we talked to Dave Burke and Dan Sandler from the Android team there was
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:55.140]   a rumor that he was too hard to names we came up with numbers but I want to
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:58.180]   point out that left to my own devices I would have called this thing queen cake
[01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:02.420]   people are dying to know what is going to happen to the Android statues at
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:06.900]   Mountain View I'll spill the beans we're gonna we're gonna have a number
[01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:10.700]   statue it'll be fun and then even you and as you'll be able to sign it and so

[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:17.860]   place on earth
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:23.180]   did you know that we were gonna do this I found out it's the first time sorry we're
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:28.220]   just having a one-on-one I love it I love it I know well we have we don't go
[01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:34.020]   with ours up I guess you got another me oh yeah yeah so what about Jack Dorsey
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:41.620]   well do you want to stop oh my god it's not even the first time the CEO of
[01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:47.220]   Twitter has been hacked no I think I think the amusing thing here is that a
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:53.460]   Twitter is still open to SMS because the the fundamental attack vector here was
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:59.020]   that they were able to the the hackers got are we using the SMS vector to
[01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:03.540]   actually send text messages from an SMS so what they actually without
[02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:08.500]   authentication the only authentication is it came from your phone number that's
[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:12.540]   right so they got Jack Dorsey's phone number they sim jacked which is the
[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:16.020]   sim jacked but but also Twitter's options I mean it's amazing that that
[02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:21.980]   because I have Twitter to factor set up yes I have to use it no I know it's a
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:26.620]   little tricky because you have to turn on SMS and then add something else and
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:31.060]   then turn off SMS but I use a ubeque so nobody's gonna nobody's gonna hack my
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:37.060]   account Jack Dorsey doesn't have that well why would he
[02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:41.860]   never uses it it's not like he uses Twitter or anything he's spending most
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:45.860]   of his time meditating and fasting or something but you know whatever I think
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:51.260]   the interesting thing here is a for me as a as and my focus on business and the
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:55.500]   land of corporates is that you can't trust your telcos they're not secure
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:01:00.100]   they're not safe they're incompetent businesses don't use SMS for for two
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:04.820]   factor and if you do I agree there you can with some telcos like T mobile
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:08.460]   texting me last year saying please put a pin on your account yeah you don't get
[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:13.460]   sim jacked right even if you do that social engineering like you never
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:16.780]   talked about that like because I have those things on my account and then I
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:22.620]   always worry okay here's the one company I will call out as I'm so angry
[02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:26.380]   with them about this because it's money and and I've had to turn off two factor
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:31.700]   which I don't want to do but I don't feel comfortable having it tied to SMS
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:39.660]   that's pay pop pay pop refuses to use OTP for two factor and I was the first
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:44.540]   company I used a dongle with but yeah problem is they always have a fall back
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:50.420]   to SMS whatever the weakest link is that's the one that the bad guys will use
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:53.620]   and even now they've changed from what I understand they didn't even have a
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:59.700]   dongle right they got rid of it but you know what my bank does that most banks
[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:07.140]   still use SMS yes and you know the worst one Verizon of all people they use the
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:11.700]   secret question methodology I know which I don't mind if I can provide
[02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:18.140]   completely random answers but no the answers are in a drop down so there is a
[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:22.380]   sub a limited set of questions and a limited set of possible answers and it's
[02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:28.140]   in a freakin drop down yeah give me a bit so the the the the fall back from here
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:32.580]   Leo my extension of that is you can criticize the methodology but at the end
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:36.300]   of the day you can't trust a telco you can't trust the people who give you your
[02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:40.260]   mobile phone to keep that data secure you can't trust them to operate safe
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:44.500]   and secure businesses you can't trust them to run networks that are private and
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:48.260]   to keep your data private you have to assume that they're incompetent and you
[02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:51.460]   have to take steps to cut them out of the loop and that's something that we've
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:56.500]   been seen proven over and over and over so my point would be is that the hacking
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:00.980]   of Jack Dorsey's Twitter account is partly a failure have him personally but
[02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:04.860]   we as experts need to take responsibility for the incompetence of the people in
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:10.540]   our supply chain and in this case it's Verizon AT&T whoever it is and they have
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:14.900]   proven consistently competent at securing their services and we should take
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:19.100]   steps to get around it's no big deal if Twitter's a Jack's account gets hacked
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:24.100]   big deal no it's not like you think it's safe to assume the president has to
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:28.140]   factor on his Twitter account no I think it's safe to say somebody's
[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:37.540]   monitoring it closely because I mean the chuckling group that hacked Jack you
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:40.300]   got to figure the chuckling group is thinking if we could only get the
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:45.540]   president's tweets we could launch an atomic war yeah I mean he had a secret
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:48.340]   phone for a long time he was supposed he didn't like whatever phone that they
[02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:53.380]   gave him and and oh he's using some old Android four phones saying so yeah I
[02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:59.660]   mean I genuinely like obviously there's gotta be a secret service guy who's
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:05.500]   watching over his shoulder I would bet it's already been hacked we don't we
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:09.940]   just don't know it because he's on a seven-second delay oh of course and and
[02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:14.380]   there's somebody at Twitter head he's got his own server at Twitter and there's
[02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:18.860]   somebody at Twitter headquarters is vetting everything no how do you even
[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:22.940]   know what's real and what's not it all sounds nuts well but also remember when
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:29.660]   the contractor blocked it like a yeah so I would like to think there's a
[02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:32.420]   seven-second delay and then they have those other things in charge but since
[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:36.740]   a contractor was able to disable his account yeah no but if I'm also being
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:41.820]   honest as terrible as the sounds okay so the president's Twitter is is hacked
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:45.340]   like was the worst that can happen he's already basically declared war over
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:48.700]   tweets before he's already threaded like nuclear weapons so like honestly
[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:53.540]   like who cares like I hate to be in the house while they have these are these
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:58.680]   are these are these are not like the word yeah this is not a
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:02.980]   Twitter is not a system of record it's not it is the system of record and
[02:05:02.980 --> 02:05:07.860]   courts have held it is a system of record it is it's legally a system of
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:14.220]   record it can be it is it should be it can make the stop market drop 400
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:19.420]   points in one day it can and have yeah so if you think Greg Pharaoh that the
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:26.180]   telcos are untrustworthy what about Twitter well let's not go there I personally
[02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:31.500]   have to come to it almost but I've come to almost a dead stop on using Twitter
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:36.020]   because it's just a time suck and it's mental mentally damaging I think that's
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:40.980]   why Christine is resting heart rate weight to 136 as she was you I could
[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:46.140]   that would do it to me a couple of DMS from some people that are that are just
[02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:51.180]   not worth reading you know yeah it can be like that no I think that the takeaway
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:55.580]   here is the fact that your telco is incompetent and should not be trusted to
[02:05:55.580 --> 02:06:01.900]   to handle SMS the system that you know lets you hijack a sim or to emulate you
[02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:04.820]   know you can get into the SS7 signaling and spoof a message and make it look
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:08.660]   at comes from your phone has been vulnerable for 20 years and they've done
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:13.540]   nothing about system 7 isn't yeah yeah that's just a nightmare - there's another
[02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:17.420]   there's SS7 there's another nightmare hey I'm gonna end in a happy note we can't
[02:06:17.420 --> 02:06:25.180]   end in that note as a happy note Microsoft has told the Linux developers we
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:33.620]   want you to build X fat into the Linux kernel I will so much to this is X fat
[02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:38.460]   which is widely used on USB keys and stuff because it's a extended fat it's
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:44.020]   works with max it works with Windows but it's always a problem on Linux Microsoft
[02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:48.340]   has the patent it's Microsoft's file system they announced today that they are
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:53.860]   supporting the addition of X fat they publish the specs and they said come on
[02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:57.900]   and I think the links kernel developers say yeah we're gonna put it in yeah
[02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:03.180]   I've read cool and it's already started one you want NTFS X fat is still not good
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:07.300]   enough for you still have to use fuse if you don't want to use NTFS thumb keys
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:12.220]   and things extra can't you can't use one step at a time little custom large in a
[02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:17.780]   file one step at a time I mean it'd be great yeah I mean honestly more look I
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:23.020]   think this was Pat and Kumber for a long time when Microsoft donated patents to
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:27.060]   the OIN last year a lot of people wondered about this I think this is good
[02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:31.740]   look every file system could have improvements but yeah Greg Crow Hartman
[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:34.980]   who's one of the Colonel Gods has already started working on a patch to get
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:38.380]   support and I mean I think at the very least if you do anything if you deal with
[02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:43.820]   Canon you know like memory cards at all or things like that yeah exactly like
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:47.300]   this is great for your interoperability you know with Linux I think this is
[02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:53.660]   awesome that's a happy note it's a very geeky very minor happy note and it is a
[02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:57.580]   sign that Microsoft is changing and transitioning to a modern future where
[02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:01.380]   it knows you know you don't spend seven billion dollars on GitHub and then say
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:07.020]   you can't have the patent to a file for a file system that's 30 years old yeah
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:12.180]   see we ended on a nice note everybody's making nice everybody likes everybody
[02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:17.980]   it's a wonderful world we love it we're not watching what are you watching on TV
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:22.260]   these days that Christine anything good well I'm really looking forward to the
[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:26.740]   final season of the good place coming back and I saw we took the Universal
[02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:31.140]   Studios tour and I saw where they shoot the good places the old it's it's
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:35.500]   was it was called Europe because it looked like an old European town and they
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:38.460]   remade it and they've got all the good place stuff there and I thought this is
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:46.460]   so cool I saw heaven yeah so there's always so much good stuff on on
[02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:51.500]   Netflix and on HBO and whatnot I really like euphoria I thought euphoria I was
[02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:54.460]   really prepared to think this is grim and depressing and I thought that was
[02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:59.220]   amazing that was great I loved it I loved it so but yeah I know you know
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:04.380]   fault traditional network fall TV season is about to start so that's always good
[02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:08.580]   although it's weird right because that used to be at least for me like one of
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:12.500]   my favorite times of the year because it's changed hasn't it September used to
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:17.500]   be like this is the big deal right and now because shows launch whenever and
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:20.940]   they launch all at once like you know it used to be those the thing where I
[02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:24.020]   would always get the entertainment weekly in the TV guide and I would like
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:28.300]   lay out almost like a I would get a notebook because I was a geeky child and
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:34.460]   I would like create my own like little rat I was like make list of hey what
[02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:37.500]   shows do I think are gonna last which ones are good like I would make my own
[02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:42.700]   like schedule of like okay wow what I'm gonna watch and and now you know like
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:48.580]   it's all available everywhere but still it's it I still enjoy fault all TV
[02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:57.460]   seasons so that's so adorable you still get TV guide no I don't but I you know
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:01.580]   I I would pay like historically anyway like I doubt it's any good anymore they
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:06.540]   I used to love their crossword and I used to buy it was easy yeah it's really
[02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:12.940]   easy some of them were like really mister blanks neighborhood and we're
[02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:16.860]   like really like obscure and so I would buy I bought like the old books but
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:22.740]   they had like the 50s yeah like the 70s and stuff fill silvers character I'm
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:26.420]   like who I'm like you know so I now know all these weird random old TV facts
[02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:30.220]   because of TV guide crossword puzzles I'm like I've never seen this show but I
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:33.100]   know this because I've had to answer this clue so many times
[02:10:33.100 --> 02:10:37.340]   hysterical that's hysterical how about you Greg what's your favorite tap beer
[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:42.020]   these days at your local well I had to stop I've been ill for a couple of months
[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:46.780]   I had to yeah I know it's not haven't been badly ill just mindily ill which is
[02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:51.100]   pretty bad if you can't have any beer yeah I've been switching to gin actually
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:11:01.940]   okay UK is really taken on gin and in a big way yeah I want more
[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:06.180]   clean so I should have brought the bottle the one I'm drinking at the moment
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:10.980]   is called unicorn gin I love it it's got this glittery swirly so you shake it up
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:15.060]   and it's all anyway that's it's a joke because I have my unicorn poster over
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:19.620]   there I love gin I shouldn't yeah gins it's just absolutely all the rage
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:24.060]   that's basically everything new in the UK I always associated gin with the UK
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:28.820]   but you can go to the supermarket now and there's like 80 90 different gins just
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:33.540]   in the supermarket much less specialist drinking place which is fun so yeah
[02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:36.740]   no I've been well as drinking gin for a little while and I had to stop for a
[02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:40.020]   couple of months of getting ready to start drinking again because the world
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:44.180]   is getting very much like that it is definitely necessary time to start
