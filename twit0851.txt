[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.500]   We'll talk about the week's tech news, which there is a serious dearth,
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   but that's why I put together three of my favorite BS's to fill the, to stretch and fill the time.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   Sam Hable, Sam is here. He's a great, he's a car guy.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   He joins us on the radio show every week.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   He's been on the show many times.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   Principal researcher at Guidehouse Insights.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   But you're not just an analyst for cars at Guidehouse. You do all kinds of stuff.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   All sorts of transportation. I focus on automotive, but we also have one of my colleagues that's focused on aviation.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   And I'm interested in all kinds of topics.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   So I can talk about just about anything and at least make it sound reasonably authoritative even if it's...
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500]   And that's why you're here today.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   Exactly. His podcast, he does it with Robbie Baldwin. We love Robbie and Nicole.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   And that's WheelBearings.media.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.500]   Great to see you, Sam. Also great to go to the great state of Hawaii and say hello to Doc Rock.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   Aloha.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   Aloha. How's it going?
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   Good to see you.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   Oh, as we get ready for the holiday season, we'll kick you with Millie Kaliki Makka.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.500]   Millie Kaliki Makka is the Hawaii.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500]   I'm doing the Bing Crosby now.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   That's almost right. That's almost right. You're pretty good. You remember it.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   Yeah, I think Liki Makka is the Hawaiian way to say it.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   It's Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. It starts tonight.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   Great to have you, Doctor of the Rockter.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   And all the way from Vatican City. You were here on Halloween.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.500]   Thank you for filling in. That show was legendary with Ian Thompson.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   That was fun.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   That was a good one.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   Oh my god, Brianna Wu and you and Ian, what a team.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.500]   We brought Robert back because he's also very good at filling time.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   I'm being honest. I'm just being honest.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   That's my official job title here. I'm the time filler.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   Basically, yeah.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   Okole Maluna. What does that mean?
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   That means cheers. If you're going to have a toast, you got the kole Maluna.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   Ok, but I think everyone likes to say that because Okole translated is your rear end.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500]   So everybody likes it.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   Everyone learns that.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   That's their favorite.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.500]   That's the literal translation of a kole Maluna.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   You know, like we're going to party. We're going to turn up.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.500]   Oh, you think about it? You're going to turn the bottles up.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   Ok, okole Maluna. Ok.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   I should check in where we're waiting.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   It's kind of depressing. Here we are.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   We're closing in now in the two year mark of COVID-19.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   And if you'd asked me in spring of 2020, if we would be still headed into this in the Christmas 2021,
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   I would have said, oh no, by now, it's going to be great.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   You know, it's the Roaring 20s, etc. And now we've got the Omicron,
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   a new COVID variant coming out of, well, we're not sure where it came from,
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   but South Africa is the most recent source.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   And we don't know yet how bad it's going to be, but it doesn't look good.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   How are things in Vatican City? How are you doing, Robert?
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   Are you scared?
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   We're actually pretty good.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   So rates are staying low because basically everyone here is vaccinated.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.500]   There's an incredibly small group that's refusing to get Vax that doesn't like wearing masks.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   Can't the pope just say Vax?
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   Wasn't, I thought for a while that he was against Vax.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   He wasn't like he didn't want to give it back.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   No, never.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   No, he's this pope has never been against Vax.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.500]   In fact, you cannot be in the Vatican.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.500]   So the Vatican proper, if you are not vaccinated, period.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.500]   Oh, I know what it was. He didn't want to wear a mask for a while.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   Yeah, but that wasn't a medical thing that was a religious thing.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   Yeah, he's the pope.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   People want to see his mouth. Yeah, I understand.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.500]   Correct. Yeah, I completely get.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   Well, good. I'm glad you're doing well.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   And you're coming. You said you're coming back home in a couple of weeks.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   Absolutely. Yeah.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   Two weeks assuming that nothing gets locked down, I'm going to be flying back to the states for about a month.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.500]   Great. And again, assuming that COVID doesn't go out of control, I might even embrace CES.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   Oh, that's just nuts.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.500]   That's a I'm scheduled to be there. Are you going Sam? Really?
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   I'm registered and I've got somebody putting me up there. So we'll see.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   I mean, you know, if things get really bad between now and the beginning of January, that may change.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   But right now that is the tentative plan.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   January 5th through 8th in Las Vegas, the show formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show CES.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   How's it going to be different? Is it going to be like a traditional CES?
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   Like the 2020 version? Trying to make it. We don't know.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.500]   Like a traditional. Oh, man.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   But here's it. I might just ignore the floor and do the suites and the special events,
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   the smaller events where you can be a bit more controlled and you can set appointments with people who you want to talk to.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.500]   Rather than walking the floor and being in that Petri dish of the Convention Center.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.500]   1700 exhibiting companies. That seems a little lower than usual.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   They are requiring proof of vaccination to attend.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   So while, you know, in months past that might have been reassuring.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   Now I'm not so now with Omicron. I'm not so sure.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.500]   Yeah. Yeah, I guess this is one of those wait and see things.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:47.500]   Why do you even care? Is there any re I don't think missing CES is a bad thing.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.500]   For me, it's connections. It's not the tech. I can see the tech.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.500]   It's the people. But it's the people. Yeah. I miss those.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   It's the same for me. You know, meeting up with people, especially with a lot of new companies.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:08.500]   It's your job too. Right. There's a lot of automotive technology, especially these days with you introduce us to mobile eye, big light on the phone.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   Mobile eye, big light on our company. So there's a lot of stuff that you need to see and meet and find out about, I guess.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.500]   Yeah. And like Robert, I mostly just, you know, have meetings with people.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:27.500]   I spend very little time actually roaming the floor except to get from one meeting to another.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   So, you know, I don't just browse around.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   Like, you know, my schedule usually by mid December, probably within the next couple of weeks, I will have a full schedule from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   Every day I'm there and dinners with different companies each evening.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   Well, and Mari Barra, Mary Barra will be back CEO of GM to give one of the keynotes last CES last year.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   That's when she announced quite a bit of new technology for GM, including their focus on electric vehicles.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.500]   That'll be interesting. Lisa Sue from AMD is also keynoting.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   Of course, she's been every year for the last few years. She's been very consistent.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   It'll be interesting.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   And by invitation only Liz Kliman anchor Fox business.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.500]   I don't know. I don't know. Okay, fine. All right.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.500]   I guess I won't get that invitation. Same thing with the CEO of Peloton.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   Maybe they're trying to restrict who can who can pass to them with questions.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:36.500]   You know, Leo, a few years back, there were a few companies that were pitching these remote presence teleconferencing units.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   So basically iPads on a segment. Yeah, we had one. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.500]   I think that should be the C.E.S. attendee. That's time.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   Make everybody go in remote. And then that was the last Mac world, Leo.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   Remember they were cruising around the last Mac world and we thought it was cool, but it was so far ahead of the game.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.500]   It seemed gimmicky then. Now it would just be really rad.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.500]   I think now in hindsight, it was a sign of the times it was. It really was.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.500]   I just don't understand why these conferences continue. You've given the only reason, really, Robert, is to go see people.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:18.500]   But I don't even know if you need to do that so much anymore. We're entering a new world where telepresence is the norm,
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.500]   not the exception. It's not the same though.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:29.500]   You know, I've done a lot of virtual conferences over the last two years and, you know, it's better than nothing,
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:38.500]   but it's really hard to have those spontaneous hallway conversations with people online in a virtual room.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   It's just it isn't the same. You don't meet as many people. You don't get as much out of it that way.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:49.500]   Well, and as one of our chatters, Web 6205 is saying CES has always been a super spreader event.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.500]   We just never, you know, I mean, everybody goes home sick from that. Usually just a cold.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:01.500]   But if there's a worse germ to spread, I thought we dodged a bullet in 2020.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:08.500]   January 2020, there were at least a few attendees. Now we know what COVID-19, a few people who got it,
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:13.500]   but it did not spread wildly through the conference as it could be.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   No, we know. We only just came home from conferences with a bad hangover.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:25.500]   Ironically, 2020 was the first CES where I did not catch anything.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.500]   Really? Yeah, neither. I haven't for the last four or five years.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.500]   Well, if you're prudent, you wash your hands a lot, which I did.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.500]   I think I'm going to wear masks from now on to any big events like that.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   That just seems sensible.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   There's people from all over the world. You don't know what kind of superbug could be.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   There is that San Francisco startup that has that fishbowl helmet.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   I can't find it.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.500]   If they'll let me borrow it, I will wear that all the way through CES.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.500]   Oh, I want it.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.500]   Fish. That's funny.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.500]   What's the name of the company? I might find it.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.500]   I can't remember, but it's like a filtered. It's a powered filtered unit.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.500]   It's entirely enclosed.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.500]   There was a reporter who wore it for a day around San Francisco.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.500]   If they'll loan that to me, I will wear it the entire time.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.500]   It looks geeky, which is perfect. That's right up my alley.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.500]   Okay. Wow.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.500]   I'm going to give you the name of this.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.500]   I'm trying to find it now.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.500]   This looks like it. Is this the picture?
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.500]   Yeah, this is it.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.500]   Microclimate. Yeah.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   That's microclimate's air helmet.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.500]   Wow. Okay.
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.500]   Oh, that's it. That's it.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   It looks futuristic in a bad way.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.500]   Microclimate.com. This may be a new sponsor.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.500]   We should really be talking to you.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.500]   Do you have to wear a backpack with the...
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.500]   Oh, it's got a help of filters in it.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:55.500]   So twin tri-speed fans, full-faced fog resistant acrylic dome,
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.500]   six foot USB-C cable.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.500]   Okay. I do want this.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.500]   Don't just remind me of...
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   Do you remember the size of Westworld?
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.500]   The black hole?
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.500]   The black hole, the DC film.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.500]   This is like the helmet that the robots wore.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.500]   And last year during the early...
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.500]   Like during the spring of last year, during the early part of the lockdowns,
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.500]   Ford was actually making some...
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   Manufacturing something like this after they had to shut down the car plants.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.500]   They were manufacturing the device very much like this.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.500]   It wasn't quite as cool looking as this one.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.500]   But it was basically the same idea.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.500]   It was called a powered air purifying respirator.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.500]   And what they were doing, it was a hood that you put over your head.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.500]   It's magnetic.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.500]   And they were actually taking ventilation fans from F-150s.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   Oh, wow.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.500]   And they repackaged it and had a hose coming in the back.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.500]   And it had HEPA filters.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   White scarf available as an optional purchase.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.500]   So you don't have to be...
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500]   It could be a white guy.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   Do you sound like Darth Vader, though?
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.500]   Yeah, there's not a speaker, so...
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.500]   From the future.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500]   You better learn sign language.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.500]   I really tempted to get one of these.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.500]   I know why this came off in San Francisco, though.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.500]   Oh, no.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   So, people in San Fran would be piping in some little cannabis in there
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.500]   and you know, just keeping it stuck in.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.500]   Actually, they would sell this as a portable hotbox.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500]   So you don't have to like hotbox the whole floor.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.500]   You just stay to yourself.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.500]   I think this would be a good thing.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.500]   If you're going to CES, you should really wear this.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.500]   Oh, $300.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.500]   Holy cow.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.500]   That's actually...
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.500]   Actually, that's a lot cheaper than...
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   It was 600 when they first did the story.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.500]   So that's much better.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.500]   The Black Friday special.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.500]   Yes.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.500]   Unfortunately, eight-week lead time.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.500]   So you won't get it in time for a scene.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.500]   Oh, sorry, kids.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.500]   You're just going to have to go on your own.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   Just buy one and then share it with like 20 people.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.500]   So that's better.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.500]   That'll work better.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.500]   Black Friday was a little impacted, I think, by the pandemic.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.500]   Black Friday sales, according to Adobe, which measures these,
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:13.500]   said traffic at brick-and-mortar retail stores was down 28% from 2019 levels.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.500]   It was up from last year.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:20.500]   Of course, it was really off last year, but it was up 47% compared with one year.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.500]   But the pre-pandemic, it's still down by almost a third.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.500]   Some of that is COVID, but I think a lot of it is you can buy online now.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.500]   Why would you go...
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.500]   I was going to say some of this is conflation.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   This was happening prior to the pandemic, right?
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.500]   I know for me personally, and maybe I'm just being anecdotal to myself.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.500]   From like three, four years ago, I was like, I'm not leaving this chair.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.500]   I'm pressing buttons.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.500]   I'm ordering everything, shipping things to people's house.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.500]   I was going to go drop it off.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.500]   I was just trying to make my life a lot easier.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.500]   I pretty much believe a large portion of this was already happening,
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   and then it just got sort of rapid charge recently because of the pandemic.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   Lisa and her sister used to go on Black Friday, get up at three in the morning,
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.500]   and go to the doorbuster specials at Target.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.500]   I did that.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.500]   I went in line in the past.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   Her sister is over Thanksgiving.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.500]   Lisa says, "We're getting up early."
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   She says, "No, of course not."
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   Friday morning Lisa wakes up.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.500]   She says, "I've got a 50 emails.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.500]   I'm going to be doing some shopping.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.500]   Don't bug me."
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.500]   So, yeah, I did.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.500]   Did we Target?
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.500]   Target announced that they're not doing Black Friday ever.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   No, they're doing it.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.500]   They're not opening on Thanksgiving.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.500]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.500]   Okay.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.500]   Which is frankly, why does anybody open on Thanksgiving?
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.500]   The only thing I could see opening on Thanksgiving is some grocery stores,
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.500]   maybe up until noon, if you need those last-minute supplies for dinner.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   Please.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.500]   But that's it.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.500]   See you next year, employees.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.500]   Starbucks, because I got to...
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.500]   You know, Starbucks here, I don't know if this is true everywhere,
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500]   is now the teenage hangout.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.500]   Maybe because we don't have a mall, but as malls die all over the country,
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:07.500]   I think young kids in high school are all hanging out at Starbucks now.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.500]   It's jammed with them.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.500]   Is that the case?
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.500]   I guess it is very much sort of case here in Hawaii,
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.500]   but I think part of that is twofold.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.500]   When we were kids, we may have had coffee in the house with our parents in the morning,
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:26.500]   but coffee wasn't part of our culture because the cafe, like that sort of cafe style,
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.500]   didn't exist.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:33.500]   And, you know, not that that's a bad thing, but the ability to just sit down,
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.500]   conversation, study together, do things that, like the library, and...
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.500]   Yes, maybe.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.500]   We had to be quiet when we studied.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.500]   There were a lot of places where we can go and study and didn't get shushed all the time,
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.500]   unless you wanted to study outside, which is not a good look in the East Coast when it's freaking freezing.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.500]   So, I think that one thing that Starbucks did is it did give that sort of
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.500]   co-working type space, and more and more people adopted it.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.500]   Now, prior to, say, the young kids coming there, the other thing that it was here,
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.500]   it was the place where you saw lots of circle drawing.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.500]   It became the MLM, let me sign some people up spot.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.500]   It was the office of people who didn't have offices.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.500]   Oh, everybody was drawing circles at Starbucks.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   And it's like, "No, I don't want to get an M-way.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   I know you named it seven different names.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.500]   It's still M-way.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.500]   You'll be a little bit tired."
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.500]   So, that's interesting.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.500]   Remember the...
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:34.500]   This is way back when the airplane fad that you would get on an airplane was just basically a pyramid scheme,
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.500]   but it ripped through Northern California about 20 years ago.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.500]   You'd get on the airplane and you'd get money from the person behind you.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.500]   It wasn't a real airplane.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   It was all a mess.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.500]   What?
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.500]   It doesn't ring a bell.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.500]   Okay, maybe it's just me.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   A pyramid scheme.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.500]   Back... it was a pyramid scheme, which MLM kind of similar.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.500]   Frankly...
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.500]   No, it is the same.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.500]   It's the same.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.500]   Frankly, I'm starting to wonder about crypto.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.500]   What is going...
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.500]   Crypto's... okay, parenthetically, completely...
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   We'll get back to black Friday in a bit.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:07.500]   I'm watching the World Chess Championship, right?
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.500]   Did you know what's going on right now?
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.500]   Game three was this morning at 4 a.m. Pacific time.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.500]   What's going on right now?
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.500]   So, Magnus Carlsen versus Nebo...
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.500]   Nebo, they call him, Jan Nebo-Manchi, the Russian.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   All the advertisers, almost all of them, Crypto.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.500]   Crypto.com.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.500]   These guys have so much money.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   Crypto.com just named the Staples Center.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.500]   That's what I was going to say.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500]   Crypto.com.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.500]   That's crazy.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.500]   All the ads are crypto.
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.500]   First of all, nobody goes to Staples, so I get it.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.500]   But, wow, talk about a flip to something super-left.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.500]   Like, really, we don't do office supply store like before.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.500]   That was a dope spot to go.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.500]   Not anymore.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   Crypto.com Arena for the Staples Center.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.500]   That's a sign of the times.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.500]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.500]   It's a sign of the times.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.500]   No more office supply stores.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500]   That's so '90s.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.500]   Now, it's crypto.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.500]   It's like a scene out of Free Guy.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.500]   When I first heard that story and the people in LA were losing their mind over it, it was,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.500]   again, I mean, it wasn't last thing you straight up walked into Staples.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   Tell the truth.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.500]   But, yeah, it just seemed like a scene out of Free Guy.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.500]   Ryan Reynolds, I get to joke.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.500]   Crypto.com Arena.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.500]   Yep.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   Crazy, man.
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.500]   Crazy.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   It does.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.500]   It sounds like something that would be in the idiocracy or some kind of dystopian future.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.500]   Just out of time.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.500]   We're here by the way.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.500]   Not a week.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   It's here.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.500]   Just out of spite against companies that buy naming rights to venues, I refuse, you know,
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:39.500]   if there's a venue that originally had a name, I refuse to call it by the sponsor's name.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.500]   Like here in Michigan, we have Pine Knob Music Theater.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.500]   It's an open-air, amphitheater, music venue.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.500]   For the last 15, 20 years, it's been branded as DTE Energy Music Theater.
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.500]   Oh, forget it.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   It's like, no, it's Pine Knob.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.500]   Why?
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.500]   I will always call it Pine Knob.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.500]   The Promise Staples Center had never had another name.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.620]   It was always Staples Center.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.380]   So I was just talking to somebody about the Tappency Bridge, which is the bridge we used
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.260]   to go to grandma's house over.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.500]   He said, now it's the Governor Mario M Cuomo.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.500]   Mario Cuomo.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.500]   And oh, Leo, I just came back because I had to do a conference in New York.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.500]   And, you know, after a week or so, AVUS, you know, they sent me my little report.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.900]   And I didn't pick up the easy pass because I'm like, I'm not going to cross any toll
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.900]   bridge.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.900]   It's no biggie.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:31.500]   And $11 each direction to ride a freaking Governor Cuomo bridge.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.500]   What?
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.500]   And I grew up at a Tapp.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.500]   That actually checks out.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.500]   The Tapp.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.500]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.500]   I grew up at the Tapp.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.900]   Like, you know, that in the tri-bureau bridge, you cross some suckers a couple of times.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:49.500]   And I got told up to like 156 bucks this week in this city.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.980]   I was like, what just happened?
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.540]   And they're like, yeah, you should have bought the easy pass for 80 bucks.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.540]   And it seemed like such a rib.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.820]   I'm like, I'm not going to do that.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.820]   I've just been away from home so long.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.820]   I forgot.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.820]   There's a good tip for anybody going to New Jersey.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.900]   Or anywhere where they have toll roads.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.380]   You're a while there's that.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.380]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.380]   You're a go.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.660]   Years ago, I was driving to Pittsburgh for something.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.100]   And I stopped when I got into Ohio before I got into Ohio Turnpike and bought an easy
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.980]   pass transponder from a gas station.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.540]   And online signed up and just stuck it on the dashboard.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.540]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.380]   Because I drive different cars all the time.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.620]   Whatever I'm driving, I just take it and stick it in the car whenever I'm going somewhere
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.620]   with a toll.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:37.060]   If I'm going to Illinois or Pennsylvania or Ohio, and it's so much easier.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.940]   We may have $5 gas in California, but the Golden Gate Bridge is still only five bucks
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.460]   and it's only one way.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.060]   It's free coming back.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.300]   So I guess it all evens out, doesn't it?
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.940]   That's the pain you want to go in the right direction.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.180]   In the Bay Area, if you were super cheap, you actually can ride all of the bridges in
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.620]   the Bay Area without ever paying.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.620]   You just have to keep circling.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.620]   Just go backwards.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.260]   Yeah, you just got to go counterclockwise.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.460]   That's all simple.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.100]   Meanwhile, Black Friday.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.380]   Talk about a roundabout.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.380]   We've been going counterclockwise.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.380]   Traffic.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.540]   Let's see.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:21.340]   Actually, online sales was getting back back up to the number, the prior number, $9 billion
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.380]   last year on Black Friday, $8.9 billion.
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.820]   I guess it's effectively the same this year.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.060]   People are buying online.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.540]   They're not going to stores.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.300]   The other thing that's changed, and one of the reasons it might be down slightly this
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.860]   year is it's really Black November.
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.980]   Those deals continue at least for four or five days.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.420]   It'll continue through Cyber Monday.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.980]   This whole shopping thing has changed quite a bit.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.140]   This is the success of online, isn't it?
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.340]   We don't do seasonal shopping anymore.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.540]   That's no longer our thing.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.220]   Amazon has sales throughout the years.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.980]   People can just pick up what they want when they need it.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.420]   There's no longer that artificial demand that's created towards the holiday season where you
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.980]   have to buy things now because it will be cheaper than it will ever be.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.260]   It's the same thing that happened to CES.
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.860]   Remember CES used to be the time where all tech companies for the three months leading
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:20.220]   up to CES wouldn't say a peep because they were saving it up for the show.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.220]   Now we don't do that.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.220]   It doesn't matter.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.740]   I have learned something, by the way.
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:30.660]   Amazon calls these five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday the Turkey Five.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:35.500]   So we're in the middle of the Turkey Five.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   Okay.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   Better than Cyber Monday.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.020]   Cyber Monday is really an anachronism.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:49.580]   It goes back to the days when people didn't shop until they could get to the fast internet
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.820]   at work and then they would shop online.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.220]   It's been a long time since the internet at work was any faster than the year at home.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.100]   And probably in most cases it's slower.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.180]   So that whole idea is crazy.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.620]   I actually did go to Lowe's on Friday because I needed to get a supply hose.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.620]   What was that like?
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.020]   A new dishwasher that was being delivered yesterday.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.380]   There were fewer people there than on a normal Saturday, Friday.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.300]   Yeah, we don't need to go in anymore.
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.700]   Yeah, there was no crowds at all.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.300]   In fact, your use case is the only reasonable use case.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.300]   I need it tomorrow.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.660]   And in many cases, Amazon now it does.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:30.860]   I needed pop over tins, those special tins for making popovers.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.900]   I ordered it the day before it came the next day.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.300]   It's amazing.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.460]   So Amazon is out of 10.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.340]   If I need something in Italy, it is faster to get through Amazon because if I go to any
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.700]   local stores, they're going to have to specialty order.
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.700]   Right.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.660]   We have to go to Amazon to get it.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.660]   So come back.
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.660]   Come back.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.820]   I'm just waiting for the next show.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.780]   This week in 10s, start in the open.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:03.180]   Top Amazon official said today, the online retail giant had a record breaking Black Friday.
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.340]   They didn't say how much money.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.540]   They said record breaking Black Friday.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.860]   Consumers are spending money on clothing, holiday decor, toys for children.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:20.740]   There's a slight downturn in electronics purchases, probably the chip shortage I'm thinking.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:28.340]   Or he says the spokesperson for Dave Clark, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer, said that
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:33.580]   also people had already bought their stuff for their home offices because of work from
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.580]   home.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.020]   So he expects that's one of the reasons there was this is on face the nation.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.700]   There's less sales.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.660]   He also commended the miraculous vaccines.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.580]   Oops.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:53.260]   And then asked Brennan on the host of Face the Nation.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:27:00.340]   Margaret Brennan asked if Amazon plan on issuing a vaccine mandate for its employees.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.500]   Basically said, no, he said, we're incentivizing.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.660]   We're trying to make it easier to do.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.020]   We're educating our teams.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.460]   We're not planning to move to mandates as we sit today.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.380]   So there you go.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.740]   Just everything on the good side.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:18.460]   They may release the requirement for employees to pee into water bottles while online.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.100]   So that's the win win.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.860]   That's Black Friday in a nutshell.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.540]   We'll have more next week when we get all of the numbers in from what do you call it?
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.540]   The Turkey five.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.540]   Turkey five.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.900]   Does that make us the stuffing?
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:44.380]   According to the National Retail Federation, 61% of customers already started purchasing
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.340]   holiday gifts before Thanksgiving.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.340]   That's not surprising, right?
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.340]   You just do.
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.340]   It's easy now.
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:56.220]   We started just as soon as, because here I can actually see the slowdown in shipments
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.420]   because I'm looking at Honolulu Harbor from my window.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.900]   And that's right.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:08.740]   Knowing that and Matt and Impecha, they just haven't been that busy.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.100]   And one of my brother-in-law's, he's a stewardoy here.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.700]   So even he's been telling me about what's going on with the docks.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.900]   So we started thinking about stuff that was going to be important from back in August.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.900]   Oh, that's really interesting.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.300]   It was going to take a long time.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:25.020]   Because everything that comes from I, except for coconuts, pineapples, and coffee, it's
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.460]   going to come from the mainland.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.460]   It's shipped in.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.460]   Well, not even that.
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.420]   Because of the Jones Act, everything has to go all the way to LA first, and then comes
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.420]   back.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.700]   So the Jones Act has been ruining us since, I don't know, 60-something when they made
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.940]   it or whatever.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.940]   And it's obnoxious.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:45.660]   But certain things, if I order something from Small Rig, it will go all the way to LA first
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.060]   and then do whatever it does and then turn around and come back.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.220]   And like, we'll just pass us.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.220]   It's silly.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.140]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:58.380]   So you're saying if somebody's shipping something from Japan, it can't go straight to Hawaii.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:04.340]   It has to go to LA first, and then a US shipper has to pick it up and take it to Hawaii.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.860]   Correct the Mundo.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.020]   Including the glorious food farm that I used to work for.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.860]   That's nuts.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.740]   The Jones Act is a federal law that regulates maritime commerce, requires goods shipped
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.820]   between US ports, be transported on ships that are built, owned, and operated by US
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.820]   citizens.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.820]   Talking about protectionism.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:26.820]   Wow.
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.780]   So like everything's made in China, like iPhones, can't go to Honolulu.
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.780]   Has to go to LA.
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.780]   That's what I just said.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.180]   That's what I mean by the glorious food farm I was talking to Bapol.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.180]   Oh, that one.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.180]   That's for fun.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.180]   I thought you were talking at all.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.180]   I didn't know.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.180]   And that too.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:47.180]   Listen, this says between US ports, but if it's coming directly from China or Japan or
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.420]   Korea, why would it have to go to a US port first?
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.700]   It still goes all the way to LA first and turns around and come back.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.340]   We've been trying to get that like thrown out forever.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.740]   Senator Akaka and every Hawaiian said it.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.060]   If you ever listened to what they're doing, we've been trying to get rid of that stupid
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.460]   thing for years because it is super obnoxious.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.660]   So there are, is there a backup of container ships?
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.460]   You're close to Honolulu Harbor.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.820]   No, I'm looking at it.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.660]   You're right next to the Aloha tower.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.980]   You see, is there a backup or is just that the ship's coming?
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.820]   Not that many ships coming in.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:29.980]   And like, I can see where the tugs, you know, pull them in and when they pull in because
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:34.220]   they're like heavy stacked, it takes forever to empty.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.020]   So like I can just sit there and watch them empty and normally they can empty it in like
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.020]   a day or two.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.900]   I swear it takes them like a week and a half to empty one of them things because of just,
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.340]   you know, just inundated with work.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:50.020]   Now, can I, you can, I mean, Apple ships by 747 too.
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.460]   They, you could ship direct to Honolulu by 747, right?
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.660]   If I come in through air, yes.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.820]   So normally whenever I order something Apple, I just eat it in PADI express because that
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.260]   way I know it won't take forever.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.820]   Now, were you all good boys?
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.500]   And did you avoid the wire cutter during this Turkey fight?
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.660]   Absolutely.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.700]   Absolutely.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.580]   I would never cross a picket line.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.060]   And, and Father Robert, do you know what we're talking about?
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.580]   I have no idea.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:20.180]   I am seeing that, that deer in the headline thing from you.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.420]   So this is something going on in the US, the wire cutter, which is owned by the New York
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.140]   Times has been trying to negotiate for a raise from the New York Times for some time.
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.300]   They're, they're saying, in fact, even outsiders who worked at the New York Times are saying
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:37.820]   they are really kind of mistreated and considered, you know, not, not as good as the New York
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:38.980]   Times staff.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:39.980]   And so they were underpaid.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.180]   So they went on strike.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:47.300]   They walked out for Black Friday, which of course is a huge long weekend for the wire
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.300]   cutter.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.620]   And obviously what the wire cutter does during Black Friday, Amazon Prime of Black Friday,
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.460]   their staff works long, long hours, sometimes all night to constantly say, this is a good
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.460]   deal.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.460]   It's a good deal.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.940]   This is, you should stay away from none of that.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:07.060]   And they went out and strike and they encouraged everybody to boycott it.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.060]   And I hope it's working.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.780]   That's a, that's a thing actually.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.780]   What's the thing?
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:11.780]   People wait.
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:17.700]   Like a professional review service to tell you where you buy the up to minute deals.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.700]   No, you don't.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.700]   Because they go, if you go to your shop from the wire cutter, right, they are, I'm assuming
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.900]   getting affiliate links and some other stuff like that.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:31.940]   Well, yeah, they're, they're, they're, they also do research on, you know, they look at
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.420]   what's advertised sales.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:39.180]   And tell you, you know, what is the regular price that this, that this usually sells for?
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.580]   So I'm more, does this.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.500]   So, three lists, does it, all of the, all the tech review sites, CNET, does it, will do
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.780]   it be extra active on prime day and on the Turkey five, I'm calling that from now on
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:56.060]   the two five because that's the big service that they provide.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.820]   Plus they all have affiliate links.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.940]   So they hope you'll go there, look at a review, say, yeah, that's a good deal.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.340]   And then click that link because then they get a, I honestly did not know that was a
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.340]   thing.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.340]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.340]   Really?
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:11.460]   When actually, when, when he first moved here, because when before it sold, be lamb,
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.820]   Brian lamb, sorry, that would be correct.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.940]   He moved here and he used to work out of my co-working space when I owned the co-working
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.940]   space.
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.980]   So you're, he was just popping, popping every once in a while and he would always show up
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:27.460]   for any of the small business or startup stuff that was going on just to be in the mix.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.420]   And yeah, he lives down ahead somewhere.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.740]   So not, he was at his Moto.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.420]   In fact, he was the guy who got the stolen iPhone as I remember.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.780]   The iPhone four that was found in the bar, not stolen, lost.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.680]   And then sold.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:46.440]   And then later left his Moto to start the wire cutter and it, and then got bought by the
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.420]   times a couple of years ago, we're just probably sitting on the beach right now and correct
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:56.560]   why Alua just enjoying life and relaxing.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.860]   So yeah, I feel bad.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:05.100]   The wire cutter generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the New York Times, but was
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.120]   treated as a second class citizen.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.420]   They're asking for a two and a half percent wage increase, which seems reasonable.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.420]   The times offered him one percent.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.340]   So they went out, I don't actually haven't gone to the site.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.300]   I presume they've got somebody doing it.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:28.800]   Yeah, they have, they have a bunch of freelancers that have been staffing this game over the
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.040]   last several days.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.660]   Yeah, because they're, they're not step, they're not full time staff.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.420]   And so they're not part of the union.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:40.140]   So they've had them do the stuff that there's, there's not enough of them to do all the
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.140]   coverage.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.640]   So they're, they're overworked as well.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.920]   Well, I guess a long of this is that I honored the walkout because I absolutely did not use
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.920]   the wire cutter for business.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   There you go.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.720]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.640]   The breakdowns are good too, normally.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.920]   Oh, I, the wire cutter is great.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.320]   I generally trust what they say.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.400]   Uh, somebody who was it?
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.920]   I want to give them credit.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.840]   Um, I can't remember.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:11.140]   One of the tech blogs, uh, said this is the best strike for you right now, which is a take
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.620]   on the wire cutter's line.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.620]   You know, the best remote, you know, Wi-Fi router for you right now.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.580]   So good, good on you guys.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.180]   Uh, we're, we're in support, uh, I believe it.
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:28.600]   And but don't any of you go on strike because, no, actually, uh, if you wanted to unionize
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.940]   John, it'd be you and Burke, but you could, you could.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.840]   Those meetings would be hilarious.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.260]   I'm a, hey, I'm a union member.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.100]   I'm after sag.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.100]   I believe in it.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.080]   I'm an union member member of my whole life.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.260]   And I can't wait to get that union pension.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.260]   That's going to be good.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.260]   All right.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.420]   Uh, that's why I keep doing ads.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.420]   Our show today brought to you.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.020]   Oh, this is a speaking of speaking a crypto block.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.380]   Fi here's a great way to get into crypto without buying crypto.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.380]   The block.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.220]   Fi Bitcoin rewards credit card.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.220]   This is so cool.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.220]   Lisa loves it.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.220]   She has one.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.900]   Uh, it's a beautiful black card.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.220]   It's a visa signature card, which is the best card you can get anyway.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:15.220]   So you get all the benefits of a visa signature card plus one and a half percent back in
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:20.660]   Bitcoin on all qualifying purchases and no reward limits.
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:25.260]   It's just the easiest way to get into crypto, but just doing what you normally do, making
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.660]   everyday purchases, you'll grow your Bitcoin portfolio when you buy groceries, pay your
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.740]   bills, fill up at the gas station, whatever you buy.
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:37.300]   In fact, we took it when we went to Mexico because it's a visa signature card, there's
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.460]   no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:46.300]   So for our trip to Mexico for Halloween, Lisa pulled out the black card.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.620]   It's also got the Bitcoin logo on it, which is very cool and earned Bitcoin in every single
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.020]   qualifying purchase.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.020]   What a great idea.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.380]   That was a good time to get into Bitcoin.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.980]   The beauty is you're not speculating.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.380]   You're just earning Bitcoin, which did see a fairly good return.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:05.780]   I think 230 percent annualized in 2020.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.940]   Yahoo Finance called Bitcoin the best performing asset of the last decade, performing the NASDAQ
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.820]   100 by 10 times.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.180]   BlockFi's been there for a while.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.180]   They're a leader in crypto.
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.980]   They were named to Forbes FinTech 50 list in 2021.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:23.020]   And so the nice thing is you're earning Bitcoin, but you have an account of BlockFi.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.780]   Now you can buy and sell and earn crypto of other kinds.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.020]   There's no better time to sign up and start earning Bitcoin today.
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.420]   Of course, just turn it into dollars.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.780]   You can do that too.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:37.500]   Right now you'll get a bonus of $25 in crypto after you make your first purchase with the
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.540]   credit card when you sign up at BlockFi.com/twit.

[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:50.460]   $25 bonus in crypto will be deposited right into your account right after you make your
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:54.260]   first purchase, but you got to use that address to qualify.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:38:01.620]   You're earning Bitcoin back on all your qualifying purchases today, BlockFi.com/twit.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.620]   Terms and conditions.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.860]   Not all will be eligible.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.860]   Geographic, regulatory, and underwriting restrictions apply fees and terms are subject
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.060]   to change additional terms of service at BlockFi.com.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.660]   BlockFi is a financial technology company.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.820]   Banking service is provided by Evolve Bank and Trust member FDIC.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:18.820]   Remember that address?
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.860]   Use it please so they know you saw it here.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:26.300]   B-L-O-C-K-F-I-K-F-I.com/twit.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.380]   Pretty soon we're going to call this the Crypto.com Studios I think.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.420]   That's the next thing.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.420]   Hey, Leo?
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.420]   Yes.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.620]   The Sears Tower says what?
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.620]   It's third renaming?
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.300]   Sears Tower, what do they call it these days?
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.300]   What's Sam?
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:44.920]   I was just going to ask if Lisa sent that Bitcoin refund to your locked wallet.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.060]   No, she better not use that address.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.020]   She could by the way.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.820]   That number, she knows it.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.060]   It's now the Willis Tower.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.980]   It was the Sears Tower.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.660]   I think it's only been renamed the one time from Sears to Willis.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.660]   It was the same.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:06.020]   They just renamed another building and it never takes.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.020]   No one calls it.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.020]   Everyone calls it the original.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.820]   Yeah, yeah, I think you're right.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.660]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.940]   We still call it Ipcelante, not Ford City.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.940]   The candlestick park was candlestick park.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.780]   Oh, yeah, yeah, but now the Pac Bell park became 18.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.760]   The AT park, there were stuff in between.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   SBC.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.760]   SBC.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.320]   Yeah, I don't even know what it's called these days.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.400]   I think it's ATT, right?
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.400]   It's still packed.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   I still call it Pac Bell.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.940]   I call it Pac Bell park, the Giants of the Stadium in San Francisco.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.000]   Apple has gone to court.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.400]   I think this is really interesting to sue Israel's NSO group for making spyware that
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.260]   breaks Apple's iPhone.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.880]   They want to stop them from using any of their technology.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:40:04.320]   Now this lawsuit was waiting until it became clear that they could sue.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.520]   There was another lawsuit against the NSO group, and I'm trying to remember the details
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:14.240]   of that, which was initially thrown out.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.240]   I think it was.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.240]   Who was it by?
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   Was it by?
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   Oh boy.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:25.480]   Well, the problem is even if they managed to succeed and shut down NSO group, these guys
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:31.300]   are just going to pop up under another name, or they're going to go more than likely, most
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:36.540]   of the team working there came out of the Israeli intelligence service as so many of
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:45.420]   the people in the Israeli cybersecurity startup community does, they may just end up going
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.220]   back and just working for the Israeli intelligence service.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:56.200]   In fact, Israel, when President Biden called for sanctions and they did issue sanctions
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.240]   on the NSO group, Israel says, "Stop it.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.400]   This is a important part of our economy."
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.760]   They're trying to defend them.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:09.240]   Facebook sued the NSO group in a lawsuit saying they exploited a bug in the WhatsApp messaging
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.320]   system.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:22.260]   The lawsuit was initially, a trial judge refused it.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:29.500]   The trial judge in July of 2020 threw it out saying they're protected because they're
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:36.660]   foreign officials acting in an official capacity.
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.300]   Both of the suits, they hinge on the violation of the terms of service.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:44.520]   So both Apple and Facebook are claiming that, yes, you can do security research.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.760]   We can't outlaw that, but you're not allowed to violate the terms of service in doing that
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   research.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:56.640]   In both cases, the NSO group required Apple and Facebook IDs so that they could send the
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   malformed packets to targets and infect the phone.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.480]   You have to, in effect, use those services.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.080]   Let me get this straight.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:13.900]   Facebook sued, the trial judge said that you can sue.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.840]   Facebook appealed, and now in a three-nothing decision, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:25.660]   in the ninth circuit has reaffirmed the judge's ruling that the NSO group is not immune from
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:26.660]   being sued.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.140]   It is not acting as a government agent.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.220]   It is a privately owned company.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:35.660]   So that lawsuit goes on immediately after that decision, Apple sued NSO group as well
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.900]   for basically the same thing.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.900]   Same thing.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.900]   Correct.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:45.960]   Craig Federighi said, "State-sponsored actors like the NSO group spend millions of dollars
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.420]   on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability, and that
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.100]   has to change."
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.020]   Right on, go after them.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:01.140]   Microsoft Google filed an Amicus brief supporting the Facebook lawsuit.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.580]   And the reason this is an issue, as you said, it's the economy of this.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:11.980]   So hackers right now, if they find a zero-day, have a number of choices.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:18.140]   If I find a zero-day that allows me to exploit an iPhone, I can go to Apple and say, "Hey,
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:23.020]   I found a zero-day," what's called responsible disclosure, "Apple does have a bug bounty
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:27.420]   for that that might amount to maybe 50, $100,000.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.420]   You take the money.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.420]   Apple fixes it.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.420]   It goes public.
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.420]   It's done."
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:37.140]   You could also go to, there are a number of companies like Zorodium that on behalf of
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.940]   companies, Zorodium's one of the good guys.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:44.180]   The premium exploit, actually, are they one of the good guys I can't remember now?
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.620]   Is it Zimpyrium or Zorodium?
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.300]   Think Zorodium might be a bad guy.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.300]   We pay big bounties.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:55.220]   The world's leading exploit acquisition platform.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.700]   So I know I think Zorodium's good.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.420]   We talk about this on security now all the time.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:05.940]   Zimpyrium is the one that had a zero-day, a huge zero-day and they didn't use it.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:13.980]   So Zorodium takes money from the companies, buys these back maybe even for more money.
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.340]   So you could go to them.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:20.300]   But there's always, if you've got a really good zero-day, a zero-click zero-day for an
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:25.780]   iPhone, the people are going to pay the most for this, are groups like the NSO Group, because
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:32.340]   they're going to sell them for the most to countries like Turkey and Bahrain, who will
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:37.260]   pay a million dollars because they'll use these one or two times to hack particular
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.660]   people, typically dissidents, journalists, sometimes terrorists.
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.460]   Well, that's their business model.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.820]   So they are not selling the exploit.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.820]   They're selling the use of the exploit.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.140]   They want to keep the exploit because the longer they hold on to it exclusively, the
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.700]   more they can milk out of potential customers.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:03.140]   Now if this suit goes forward and it turns out that NSO cannot use accounts to send these
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.780]   exploits, then they could just change their business model to sell the zero-day exploits
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.780]   to anybody who wants them.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.780]   And then there's probably more than that.
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.780]   And then there's probably more than that.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.780]   That's not the problem for them.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.780]   Precisely.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:14.780]   Exactly.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:15.780]   So it's not going to stop the exploits.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.860]   They're just going after the profit center.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.860]   So okay.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:23.620]   So I'm a tin-horred dictator in a two-bit country and I don't like it that this journalist
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.820]   is writing articles about how corrupt I am.
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:30.420]   I go to NSO group and I say, "How much to hit this guy?"
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.540]   They say a million dollars.
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.100]   I give them a million dollars.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.740]   They use, they don't give me anything, any code.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:37.740]   Correct.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:46.700]   They use their Apple messaging account to infect the journalist's phone with malware.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:51.780]   Does that then give the two-bit tin-horred dictator access to the malware or does NSO
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.780]   run the whole...
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:53.580]   Correct.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.540]   So they can run it any way they want it.
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.460]   They can either have it shuttled directly to the dictator or they can shuttled it to
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.460]   their...
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.220]   I would assume that it goes directly to the dictator because they wouldn't want to touch
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.220]   illegal information.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.220]   Right.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220]   That would compromise them.
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:12.140]   So all the NSO group has done is use their messages account to infect the phone using
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.140]   the clear-o-click.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.140]   They unlock the door.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.140]   They unlock the door.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.140]   And then let the dictator lock it.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.140]   The dictator gets in.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.140]   Got it.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:24.940]   The next claim is you use that account under false pretenses, you violated our terms of
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.820]   service, you can't do that.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.820]   Correct.
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:33.900]   And if they win, then NSO group goes, "Okay, well, we're no longer charging you a million
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:39.020]   because we're basically going to burn this exploit if we give it to you, but we'll give
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.620]   you the exploit for 30 million."
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:49.220]   I am going to guess that one of the reasons Israel and Washington, D.C., are reluctant
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:53.540]   to do much about NSO group is that they both use it.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.540]   They're using it.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.540]   They're using the exploit.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.340]   I'm going to guess that they're, you know, the intelligence community is saying, "Well,
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.500]   yeah, they're bad guys, but it sure is useful."
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.540]   Well, that's Palantino.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:09.380]   The reality is if NSO's got this stuff, there's others that have it too, particularly...
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.700]   No, no, that's the point.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:12.700]   That's the point.
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.580]   And they guard these so 100 percent.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.620]   Now, your point is correct that some...
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:23.620]   The hacker who came up with this, if NSO group isn't there paying a million dollars, they'll
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.060]   go to the next guy giving them a million dollars.
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.060]   So so...
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.060]   Right, that's what I'm saying.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.060]   But NSO groups...
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.060]   The NSO groups...
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.260]   Exploids are tightly held.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.260]   Yeah.
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:41.460]   The FSB, these various agencies, if the NSO group doesn't have them, they have...
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:47.260]   They have other exploits, you know, or similar exploits, maybe even the same exploits.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.380]   I mean, there's no guarantee that if there's an exploit, there that only one person has
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.380]   found it.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.380]   But it's a combination of exploits that can be incredibly useful.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:01.740]   So you collect a bunch of exploits that maybe themselves don't do much, but when you start
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.380]   combining them, then you can actually get into information that you shouldn't have access
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.380]   to.
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.820]   So that's what NSO group is really, really good at.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:15.900]   They'll buy seemingly useless exploits, and then it becomes a horrible, horrible thing
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.900]   once they have enough that they can actually...
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.700]   They find ways to chain them together.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.700]   Precisely.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.700]   It's like part eight or a billion points.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:23.700]   And they're exceptionally good at that.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.660]   And then the NSO group, they're kind of like raid out of it.
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:32.500]   Like the cops want to arrest him, but they need him to do some stuff for everyone to
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.500]   know.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:39.180]   It's really interesting.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:45.100]   Of course, there are lots of people who are making money through various bug bounty programs
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:50.340]   or Pwn to Own, which is a bug bounty program or these companies like Cerodium.
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:55.820]   But if you've got a really good zero click, zero day on an iPhone and you do this for
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:00.140]   a living, you know there's a place you can go and make the most possible money.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.500]   And that's NSO group, right?
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.500]   Mm-hmm.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.260]   Well, that's what made this Imperium story so interesting when it first came out.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:13.460]   You had a research company that had an Android exploit that was a non-click exploit.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.540]   You send it and the phone is exploited.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:21.580]   This was worth millions, millions upon millions of dollars if they had just sat on it and
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.900]   developed it, but they released it under a bug bounty.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.780]   They got nothing except publicity.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:32.060]   Now it was a feel good story, but the Underground was looking at this going, "Well, that's
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.060]   just stupid.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.500]   You'll get your 150k bug bounty."
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.420]   And actually, no, they took $1,337.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:39.740]   That was it.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:40.740]   And that was it.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:41.740]   It was gone.
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:46.860]   And it turned out to be an anti-responsibility campaign because people said, "Don't be
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:47.860]   a Imperium.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:48.860]   Don't be an idiot.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.700]   Don't sell the $10 million exploit for a thousand."
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:56.980]   It's a, you know, it's a...
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.820]   What if that feel good story was a hairy?
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.260]   "Look, hey guys, I'm giving this one away for free."
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.340]   And then now everybody knows who did it.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:08.140]   So you call that guy, me, "Yo, little Mike, what you doing this weekend?"
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.140]   And you know, it come and work for us.
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.740]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.180]   That's your credo that says that you can do it.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:20.340]   The man-to-goat stacking quarters on top of the backboards at the basketball courts in
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.900]   Brooklyn, and then it became the legend.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.380]   So now everybody was after him.
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:29.780]   Prior to that, nobody in the NBA wanted to draft him because he didn't go to college.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.860]   Back then, that wasn't a thing, right?
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.300]   So yeah, maybe that's the story.
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:39.380]   Maybe now they're looking for the guy who did it and trying to bring him in.
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.940]   I feel like there's so much going on that we don't really know about.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:43.940]   Right?
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.380]   It's all behind the scenes.
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.380]   Mysterious.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.340]   Oh, there's a couple of discords for that.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.340]   Yeah.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.340]   Exactly.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.940]   You've always had a little bit of that black hat thing going on from the robber.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.620]   I dipped a toe or two.
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.620]   Which is funny because you're a priest.
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:01.620]   My peeps.
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:05.620]   I guess there's the angel on your shoulder, there's the devil on your shoulder.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.620]   He dresses in black.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.740]   Probably wears a black hat sometimes.
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.180]   There's a little professionalism.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:20.540]   I had a very long and civil message chain with a group that actually exploited a network
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.220]   here in the Vatican.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.220]   Wow.
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.460]   And he let me know how they did it.
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.980]   So I mean, I appreciated that.
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:30.980]   That was important because you're the guy who had to fix it or talk to the guys who had
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:31.980]   to fix it.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:32.980]   Correct.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.820]   Why did they talk to you?
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.820]   Why did they tell you?
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:38.020]   Did they decide it probably was imprudent to hack the Vatican?
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:44.380]   We had met each other a long time ago and he did not know that that network was connected
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.380]   to me.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.380]   Ah, yeah.
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.140]   And so he respected you.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.140]   Correct.
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.140]   Oh.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:55.420]   Robert, for years you've gone to black hat and Def Con and kind of hobnobbed with this
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.420]   community.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:59.340]   See, this is why it's working on the conferences.
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.340]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.340]   You just came up with a good reason.
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.500]   Yeah, no one's going to discuss this over a Zoom call, but they will.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:08.180]   If you give them enough tequila, they'll discuss it in a backroom somewhere.
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.180]   Interesting.
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:14.540]   It's also, I think it's important in a way as well because one thing that a lot of the
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:20.100]   guys who had the skills they went into is they went in to helping out, you know, law enforcement
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:24.020]   for kidnapping cases and things like that.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:29.860]   Some girls that are here did a really good documentary on trafficking coming from Cambodia, where
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.660]   they're originally from.
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:36.940]   And it was a group of hackers that sort of helped get the rings shut down.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.740]   And yeah, it's pretty impressive story when you hear it.
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:44.340]   So I think, you know, we do need some guys that are kind of can go on both sides in order
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:45.780]   to help solve this stuff.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:52.980]   And there's a really good one right now about a fellow who is helping this catch the scammers
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.260]   by he works in the center.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:53:00.380]   And then when he sees them about to get somebody really bad, like he'll secretly call them
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.340]   and be like, Hey, you're talking to this dude right now.
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:04.340]   He's telling you to do this.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:06.340]   And they're like, Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.340]   And he goes, don't do that.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.340]   This guy's full of crap.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:13.780]   Just hang up or see if you can merge the call in with, you know, police at the same time.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.940]   And so he, but he works in the call center in Calcutta.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.900]   And he's stopping this late.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:25.500]   The one that I saw recently, he stopped his lady from transmitting like $150,000 on the
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:29.060]   Social Security Administration fraud type thing.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.060]   It's crazy.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.660]   If I can find a story, I'll send it to you.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.740]   But yeah, it's pretty impressive.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.220]   I'm not up to date on how people become hackers.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:43.260]   In my day, the hackers I knew people like John Draper was, they had a fascination for
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.420]   this stuff.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:48.220]   They often started with phone freaking with the phone system because at the time that
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:50.620]   was the most complicated network in the world.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:55.340]   And you would dig through dumpsters out behind network operation centers and try to find
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.420]   manuals you would learn about this stuff.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:59.420]   And you would hack it.
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:00.420]   And it was fun.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.420]   It was a, it was speed-lunking.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.420]   It was exploration.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:07.420]   Later, as they became coders, they might start doing the same thing with computer operating
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.260]   systems and computer software.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:12.900]   And at the time it was just kind of fun.
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:18.180]   Some people, and again, I'm familiar with the older generation, the old school hackers.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:25.060]   And some people like Kevin Paulson and Kevin Mitnick would sometimes, you know, Mitnick
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:29.140]   had these interests and skills and then kind of turned him a little bit to the dark side
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.140]   as a way to make money.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:34.140]   He was hacking radio station contests, which isn't a huge crime.
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:36.660]   Got caught for it.
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.180]   That's old school.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:42.500]   Nowadays, maybe you know better, Father Robert, having in communication.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.580]   How does somebody be, how does somebody get into this?
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.700]   Is it the same kind of process where you kind of fascinated by computers and you learn
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.740]   to code?
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.940]   You have just wandered into one of the most toxic threads on Twitter.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:59.900]   Just look for "OpsAC" and everyone has an opinion on what a hacker is and isn't how
[00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:03.180]   you become a hacker, how you get a reputation.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:10.700]   The people who can step back and have a toe in this world and yet not be completely paralyzed
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.540]   by what's going on in the world, we see that a hacker is anyone who's curious.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:19.780]   If you like breaking things and seeing why they broke and then you're a hacker, you
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:24.620]   go to Defcon, you go to Black Hat, you talk to these people who have different skill sets.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:29.980]   When we do like a security evaluation, you're looking at everything.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:33.620]   You're looking at physical security and for someone, you would look like a deviant aldum
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.620]   and you'd bring him in.
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.420]   He is the king of physical security.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:40.180]   He will teach you everything you've done wrong about securing your perimeter.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.820]   Are they academically trained?
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.580]   Are they amateurs?
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:44.580]   Are they hobbyists?
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:48.860]   I mean, I wouldn't call them amateurs, but most of these people, they didn't get formal
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:49.860]   training.
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:50.860]   They're not formal training.
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:51.860]   No.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:52.860]   Right.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.860]   They would just, but I don't know how good it is.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:58.060]   I mean, I think there's things like the certified ethical hacker training.
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.020]   People can learn pen testing, things like that.
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:07.220]   But I think the people who are, so, and it's also, this is also that the dark side, you
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:10.580]   know, there's, and I think you have a little bit of that edge in you where you kind of
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:16.100]   are intrigued by the, you know, the kind of stuff that's a little bit beyond the pale.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.100]   A little bit.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.100]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.180]   You can train to be blue team.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.500]   There's great training for blue team, the defenders.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:27.780]   Red team is, you've got to enjoy something a bit more.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:32.420]   You've got to really like pushing past what people say is possible.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:38.740]   And yeah, you have to be willing to kind of do things sometimes that maybe aren't ethical.
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:42.020]   I'm not saying that these are bad people, but it's that curiosity.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:46.100]   The curiosity has to drive you to say, well, what happens if I do X, Y, and Z?
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.100]   Right.
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:51.380]   When normal people wouldn't do X, Y, and Z because that seems not good.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:57.220]   Difference between a black hat and a white hat, clear, or do many white hats kind of do
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.220]   both?
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:04.020]   I mean, it seems like it's a very fuzzy line between ethical and unethical hacking.
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.020]   Yes.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:08.420]   When I was younger, it was a very, I thought it was a very clear line.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:13.020]   You know, black, if you do anything illegal, if anything that you do could be prosecuted
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:15.700]   under a law, then it was a black hat.
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:19.900]   Then we started referring to people as gray hats when they would dip back and forth.
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:25.220]   But by and far, gray hats still didn't do anything that was purely, clearly illegal.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:28.420]   Now you're a security researcher.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:32.940]   And the laws that you have to cross because you're dealing with the internet, which will
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:37.540]   go across dozens if not hundreds of legal jurisdictions where something might be illegal
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:43.060]   in one place and not illegal in another, you can't really rely on those old distinctions
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.060]   anymore.
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:51.100]   And also the feds, at least in the US, have made that definition a little bit obsolete
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:55.020]   by overextending what the computer fraud act can be used for.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:59.620]   A lot of people who are doing things that are, at least on the face of it, are not illegal,
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:03.220]   are charged with illegality and end up going to jail even.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:10.980]   So that definition doesn't work anymore because federal law has frankly been bent and misused
[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:13.140]   to extend it.
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:18.100]   I think part of it, you know, there's a lot of things that, you know, white hat hackers
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:25.100]   would do that may technically be illegal, but you have to look at what the intent was.
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:30.020]   So it's not just a matter of whether it's strictly against the letter of the law, but
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.020]   what was the intent?
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.020]   Yes, but that's the problem.
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:36.860]   Is there something nefarious or were they trying to understand something to make it better?
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:44.020]   In this country, the judges and the courts and the jury's are so scared of technology
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.660]   that they don't, they don't able to make that distinction and what was his intent.
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:50.380]   They just terrified that he can do it at all.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.900]   Make some a terrorist in effect.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:57.180]   Right, like a prime example, you know, in my world, Chris Valisack and Charlie Miller,
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.980]   you know, they were hacking cars.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.140]   Yeah, I mean, they were hacking cars.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:09.140]   I mean, they were well known even before the 2015 G-Pak, but that's the one that really
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:13.660]   made, you know, brought them into the public domain that, you know, a lot of people suddenly
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.780]   became aware of them.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:21.860]   And after that, you know, I mean, what they did was probably illegal, you know, against
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:28.540]   the relatives, the letter of the law, but they were trying to demonstrate to people that,
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.060]   look, this is a real serious problem.
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:33.260]   Look what is possible.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:37.340]   And you know, they probably could have been prosecuted if somebody wanted to prosecute
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.340]   them.
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:44.020]   Fortunately, you know, they, you know, the authorities and Chrysler, you know, opted not
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:48.380]   to do that and instead, you know, to work with them to understand the problem and fix
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.180]   the problem in those vehicles.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:57.780]   And now those two guys are actually both, they are in charge of cyber security at Cruz,
[00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:00.300]   GM's autonomous driving division.
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:07.660]   You know, I know exactly the day where my stance on white hat, black hat shifted.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.460]   It was September 25, 2010.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.420]   That was the Aaron Schwartz case.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:17.940]   You have a young man, perfect example downloads academic documents.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.900]   These are not top secrets off the J store database at MIT.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.980]   He didn't hack anything.
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.700]   He plugged into the network.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:28.940]   They just didn't want him downloading all those documents and making them public.
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:34.020]   And the United States goes after him with all its, its fury and ruins his life and he
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.420]   effectively killed him.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.420]   He ended up killing him.
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.420]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:43.020]   And here is a guy who had been hugely instrumental in so much of the technology we use had he
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:49.380]   lived would have been a major contributor to, to so many different things.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.380]   It's so tragic.
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.460]   And yeah, complete overreach on the part of the prosecution.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:01:02.220]   And that's because I swear, okay, so if you're a realtor or, you know, insurance agents,
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:06.820]   doctors, anti-bhelmed people, you have these containment education credits that you have
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:10.980]   to take in order to maintain your status.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:17.940]   Why we do not do that for politicians, especially when it comes to things like tech and tech
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:23.340]   security and understanding of how it all works and things like that.
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:30.620]   I have seen in these testimonies, you know, watching C-Span and they're having a hearing,
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:35.860]   they ask some of the questions that I swear my mom wouldn't ask.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:40.860]   And I'm like, how do you run a state with a stupid question like that on something just
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.820]   real, real basic, right?
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.420]   And it's super obnoxious.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:49.940]   It is super obnoxious and it's sad and it's somewhat depressing.
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.300]   And these guys are in charge of making decisions, right?
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:59.100]   I mean, we still have hard, by all standards, we still have horrible broadband because these
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.580]   guys don't understand the importance of it.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:06.340]   And then when we fall behind in things like security and things like that, because no
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:13.860]   one's putting an effort towards it, they're not making legislation that helps kids learn
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.940]   more about the electronics and techs.
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.900]   And then they complain about why is all of this manufacturing for all the tech stuff
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.900]   overseas?
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:25.260]   Because you've set up rules and regulations here that don't allow for that industry to
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.420]   thrive.
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:27.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.420]   Right.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:33.020]   If you put that much effort into tech, as you did in the Letting Big Farmer thrive,
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.540]   we'd be in a different position.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.820]   And I'm going to put my soapbox back.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:43.780]   I know I agree with you 100% although it seems like a cop had to say dumb governance, dumb
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.740]   legislators, dumb judges.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:49.660]   Admittedly, they should know more and they should know better.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:54.740]   Clearly they need to because if we're going to be a part of the 21st century, they've
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.980]   got to be part of the 21st century.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.140]   I understand their fear though.
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:07.020]   When you have a group of people who, young people who maybe aren't connected to society
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:13.460]   in the same way that the rest of us are, they feel a little bit alienated.
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.900]   They have really sophisticated skills that you don't really understand.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:26.340]   It feels like these people can get under the hood of everything we do and cause chaos,
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:32.700]   but they're potentially very threatening and they don't seem to care about making the
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:37.060]   world a better place or about even doing the right thing.
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.700]   That's terrifying.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.060]   And I understand their fear of that.
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:45.620]   So what do we do to fix this?
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.180]   Because we do live in this situation right now.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:54.140]   And what's happening is there are people like the NSO group who are saying, well, we're
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:58.300]   going to take these disaffected young people with his incredible skills and throw money
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:03.740]   at them and co-opt their skills to do bad things.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.740]   We've got to provide an alternative.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:11.740]   And Apple's $50,000 bug bounty for something that NSO group will pay $2.5 million for is
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.740]   not enough.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.460]   We've got to do something about that.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.460]   What do we do?
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.460]   What do you guys think?
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.460]   What do you start with you, Robert?
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.460]   What do you think?
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.460]   What do you do?
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.460]   Okay.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.940]   So there's a multi-prong approach.
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.300]   First of all, you have to make it.
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:26.620]   You have to make companies take security more seriously.
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:27.620]   20 years in--
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.220]   But they're never going to win against these guys.
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.620]   They're never going to win against these guys.
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:36.060]   But you can at least make it so that the entry is not so dang low.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.420]   They give a little harder.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.420]   Okay.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:42.060]   Year after year, I hear these speeches from people talking about how we're going to take
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.740]   security first.
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.820]   Nobody does.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:49.060]   Security is still a thing that you slap out on the end of it after it's gone through
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.580]   PR and all the Q&A people.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.740]   That's the wrong approach.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:05:00.580]   The second thing is, if you want these researchers to be playing for the good guys, you have
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:03.300]   to pay them a decent salary.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:11.380]   I have three former students who work for China right now because they're getting paid.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:16.460]   And I mean, I get you can make all sorts of judgments about them, but if we're not willing
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.820]   to pay them, they'll go to someplace that will value their skills.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:20.820]   I remember--
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:27.060]   Of course, an incredible scene from Goodwill Hunting when the NSA comes to this math genius
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:30.420]   played by Matt Damon and asks him to work for them.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.220]   And he's got the greatest speech.
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:37.180]   It's one of the great movie monologues of all time about why he would never consider
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:40.420]   working for the NSA.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:45.740]   But how do you reach out to a person like that and say, "Well, but we need you.
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:46.740]   We need you."
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:51.220]   The second thing, you don't do what you did, Aaron Schwartz, which was unconscionable.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.740]   So that was clearly the wrong path.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.740]   What do you do?
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.180]   You don't know, I think it's wrong to say, "Hey, come to work for the NSA, too."
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:02.580]   What do you do to foster these kinds of people to help them move in the direction where it's
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:06.300]   helping the world be a better place instead of being a negative?
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.300]   That's what we have to solve.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:11.620]   I can give you a very clear and concrete example.
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:18.060]   A few years ago, we had an NSA representative that had the NSA came to a DEFCON.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.180]   And we had him.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:24.220]   We had all the proof that they were spying on communications.
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:27.380]   They had installed equipment into the Fed.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.380]   Right.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.020]   Well, no, we actually had.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:36.220]   We confronted him with the evidence that the NSA was inside the series of data centers
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.220]   across the country.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.340]   That they were spying on US citizens.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:44.500]   The bold face told us that's not true.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.540]   That destroyed any possible relationship that he could have had with the people in that
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.540]   room.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.540]   Yeah, that's a very good thing.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.540]   You can't lie to us.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.540]   No.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.540]   We know more than you do, so don't lie to us.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.860]   They're too smart.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.620]   I think you play on their patriotism.
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.860]   You play on their desire to be.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:00.980]   Everybody wants to contribute and be good.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:06.060]   You become alienated because you get shut down.
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:11.260]   But if you don't shut them down, don't lie to them, treat them with respect and encourage
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.180]   them to do the right thing.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.940]   I mean, they're going to be bad guys, but you need more good guys.
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:19.620]   If there's more good guys than bad guys, then you have a chance.
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.740]   There's another important segment of it is too.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:29.060]   We really do have to start realizing that the best thing that we'll ever do to fix anything
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:33.500]   here is start focusing on education and making education and lie easier.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.500]   Right.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.260]   Everybody like that who's gone through school, right?
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.820]   More than likely they collected student loans or whatever in order to get there.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.780]   One of the first things you do just as a good will gesture, look, we're just going to wash
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.780]   your student loans for you.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.300]   We'll go ahead and take care of that.
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.300]   That's one.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:53.140]   The other thing is we have got to work really, really hard on dealing with mental illness
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.740]   in this country and the stigmatism that goes with it still to this day, even though we've
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.020]   gotten so much better.
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.020]   Right.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:05.260]   A lot of these people, their disinfection, some of it is a mental illness, but we don't
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:12.220]   make it easy to because they got teased by everyone in school because they were, say,
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:20.340]   standoffish or a little on the spectrum or Asperger's, of functioning person.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:25.660]   Because we're taught in school to tease these guys, then that makes it worse.
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.140]   Not like, you know, maybe-
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.700]   We need to celebrate them.
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:29.700]   Right.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:31.780]   We're the heroes of the future.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:32.780]   Hama.
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:34.740]   That's not, celebrate the neurodiversity.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.940]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:41.620]   Wesley Faulkner's been saying that that's a really good point.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.820]   This is where the ideas come from.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:48.140]   This is where the innovation comes from, not from people like me or think inside the
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.220]   box.
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.660]   This is from people who break out.
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:56.300]   We've mentioned several times that we have to appeal to their willingness to do the right
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.620]   thing.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.620]   The issue is-
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.620]   Is that the people I know?
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.980]   No, no, it's not naive.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.900]   Most of the people that I know who are in this world, they are in their mind doing the
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:08.900]   right thing.
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.900]   Of course, no one does the wrong thing.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.620]   Because they don't trust the US government.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.620]   Right.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.900]   So you want to appeal to them, you better prove that your trust were-
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.900]   Right.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.900]   That's why lying is a bad idea.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:17.900]   Yes.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:18.900]   You have to make it something worthy.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:23.740]   Yeah, that's really important.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:26.300]   No evil genius thinks he's evil.
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.580]   Some of the people in the movies.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:38.060]   What's funny too is that I think a lot of people who vocally say in large groups that
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:42.980]   they don't trust the US government, they don't actually not trust the US government or any
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.300]   government for that matter.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.340]   They just said it because it's the end thing to say.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:52.660]   So we should do start with stop saying the end things unless you really like that.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:55.660]   And if you really like that and you have a good reason, hey, that's good.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:10:01.820]   But I do think a lot of people follow repeat things that they don't actually have a true
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.460]   foot in the game.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:08.740]   And that causes a really, really loud reverberation chamber.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:13.340]   It's challenging because of course, if you're super smart and you're kind of on the outs
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:19.300]   because you're a little weird anyway, the default is just say, I don't, you know, I'm
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.300]   not going to trust those guys.
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.140]   I'm going to go my own way, no matter what.
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.620]   And it's- I understand why that's the fault.
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.380]   It may be just impossible.
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:32.660]   I just feel like we are getting rapidly getting to a crisis situation.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:37.980]   You know, governments are solving this by hiring people, training them, teaching them.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.460]   I'm sure Russia is doing this.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:40.460]   China is doing this.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.180]   They have amazing hacking teams.
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:43.900]   They're not getting these people.
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.900]   I don't know.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:48.980]   Do you think they're getting these people from the streets or they're actually taking people
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:53.100]   out of school who have good math skills and teaching them what they need to know.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.700]   They're creating their own hacker core, right?
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.740]   I mean, you can look for aptitude.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.900]   There are certain things, certain characteristics that you look for when you're looking for someone
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:04.380]   who will be a good security researcher.
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:05.820]   And there's also some training.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.500]   You can give people the basic training.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:11.020]   Do you actually know how to do a proper network scan?
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.580]   Do you know what, how to look for exploits?
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:17.820]   Do you know how to crash a database or to test for a crash?
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.820]   You know, so those things you can teach and then you just see where it develops from there.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:25.380]   The ones you're looking for will take the information that you've given them and they
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:29.180]   will start connecting the dots and say, "I'll do this, then this, then this."
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:36.900]   They're the kind of people you immediately get out, shake out because they don't trust
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.900]   authority.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.900]   They're anti-authoritarian.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:39.900]   They're unruly.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.900]   They're rebellious.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:44.900]   They're all the things you don't want in the military or a security service or intelligence
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.900]   service.
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.860]   So they wash out in the program.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.860]   Those are the guys you want.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:55.100]   Stop washing out the rebellious ones, the neuro-diverse ones, the weirdos because those are the ones
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.100]   you want.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.220]   You want the ones who will immediately not follow the instructions.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.700]   That's part of the problem.
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:04.820]   You don't want the ones that are going to be drones that just follow orders and do the
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:05.820]   problem.
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:07.820]   Right.
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:11.300]   That anybody who's really good at this already hates you by default because you're the authority.
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:13.140]   So this is challenging.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.740]   It's a great conversation.
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:19.760]   We aren't going to answer this today, but I think it's a really fascinating conversation.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.260]   I know how we got went down this road.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.060]   I guess we're talking about the NSO group.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.540]   Let's talk about the Apple's AR headset plans.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:26.780]   That's next.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:27.780]   Great panel.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.780]   Sam Eble.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:29.780]   Sam-It.
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.300]   Our car guy is here from Guide House Insights.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.700]   His podcast, Wheel Bearings, available everywhere.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.700]   Great to see you.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.720]   What are you driving this week?
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:44.260]   I have a new Chevy Tahoe that has a 2022 Tahoe that has GM's new infotainment system
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.260]   that's built on Android automotive.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.140]   So you've got a great life.
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:49.340]   New car every week.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.500]   I love that.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:54.340]   Father Robert, tell me about the eggs this morning at the Vatican.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:55.740]   Oh, I guess.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.740]   Actually I did take a picture of the eggs.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.620]   They were not eggs.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.620]   I don't know what they were.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.580]   Were they at least yellow?
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:04.580]   Robert.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.020]   No, they were greenish.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.540]   They make an honest effort to do something that's creative, but most of the time it just
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.060]   turns out like, "Ah, no."
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.060]   You know what's bad?
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:18.820]   Not even the wildlife around the career will eat the eggs.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.340]   They just sniff it and walk away.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.340]   Do you have a new cat?
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:24.260]   Because I see a lot of cat pictures on your Twitter feed.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:26.180]   I don't have any cats.
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:30.620]   There is a colony of feral cats that will feed them.
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.620]   You could feed them.
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.620]   Oh, look at them.
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.620]   You're kind of cute.
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:39.740]   How many of them has become a lap cat?
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:42.820]   There are five in the group that I call the Vadakats.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:47.620]   And there are three in the group that I call the TNG cats.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:51.340]   Lisa, I'm going to have to send these to Lisa.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:52.980]   Oh, she's going to really.
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:53.980]   That's Popo.
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:54.980]   Oh, Popo.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:56.980]   Nice to see him.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:59.740]   It's not named after the Pope, named after the Dragon Ball Z character.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:00.740]   Oh, please.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.740]   Yes.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.460]   I hope there's no confusion about that whatsoever.
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:08.900]   The papal felines.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.700]   And also great to have you, Doc Rock.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.380]   I always enjoy you.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.380]   You're so much fun.
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.020]   You tube.com/docrock.
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:18.580]   You were in special forces.
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:20.020]   I know you were in combat.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:25.260]   No, I was with the unit, but I myself am not batched.
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.260]   Okay.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.580]   So I worked in the unit because I was a medic.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.580]   Oh, that's right.
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:31.580]   You were a medic.
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:36.940]   You were very much into like, I guess at the time we were still building.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.340]   You know, the army wasn't as big at the time.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.500]   So I ended up just working in the unit.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.500]   It was cool.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.780]   How did you do with authority?
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:48.140]   With somebody telling you where to eat, what to do?
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:53.020]   You know, I always had it in the back of my head that when I got in charge, I wouldn't
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:57.900]   act like that, but I was smart enough not to buck the system right away.
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:02.300]   And then I would go fix things and then come back and they'd be like, Oh, how did this
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.860]   get like, Oh, you told me to do that?
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:04.860]   And they were like, Oh, yeah.
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.860]   Okay, I did.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.860]   And so I just learned to let them feel like they did it.
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.820]   So I tricked my way through it.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.220]   Yeah, let's put it that way.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.500]   Well, thank you for your service.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.340]   However, you got through it.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:19.860]   It's great to have you all our show today brought to you as it often is by a company.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:23.740]   I am a big fan of called podum.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.020]   You know, the world has changed.
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.720]   The pandemic has brought us a whole new world.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.380]   One of the things I like about it is we are doing a lot of texting, not only to each other,
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:37.940]   but with businesses, things like ordering food and then knowing when your food's ready,
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:43.220]   knowing when to pick up your groceries, knowing, I mean, it's how I make my appointment to
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:47.060]   get my car serviced or my, my, my teeth serviced by my dentist.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:51.380]   If you own a business, you know, there aren't enough hours in a day to waste playing phone
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.380]   tag.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:56.300]   The list of customers you need to reach isn't getting any shorter, especially when business
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.380]   is good.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:01.660]   That's why local businesses everywhere turn to podium.
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.860]   Potium makes every interaction as easy as sending a text.
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:08.380]   And you know what, your customers love it.
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:09.540]   I don't want to call.
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:14.260]   I want a text because it takes the friction out of interacting with the business.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.660]   Everything that makes your business great can get done faster.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.700]   It's not just a better way to communicate.
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.460]   Potium is a better way to do everything.
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:26.140]   You can use podium to ask for reviews as somebody leaves your store.
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.820]   They get a text saying, hey, was our service good?
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:32.380]   Leave a review at Google or Yelp or wherever you like to get your reviews.
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.380]   You can collect payments.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:36.980]   Nowadays, it's easy to pay using text messages.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.660]   And I'll, I'll speak for myself.
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.300]   I would far prefer to do that.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.020]   Touchless payments is very easy.
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:47.220]   Of course, marketing, making appointments, just staying in touch.
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:48.340]   It's so much easier.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:53.660]   I get a coupon every few weeks from the local ice cream parlor by text.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:55.060]   And I have to say it works.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.740]   It works with podium as a business.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.020]   You won't just free up more time.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.020]   You'll grow your business.
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.220]   You'll get more done.
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:04.540]   You'll close deals with customers faster than the competition.
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.060]   Even has a chance to call them back.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:11.420]   Honestly, every business, you know, used to be, if you were a business, you had to have
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.100]   a, what an answering machine, then a voicemail.
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.700]   You had to have email and you had to have a website.
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:20.580]   Nowadays, you got to be on text.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.300]   Text messaging, it's the future.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.020]   Real business, real ROI.

[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.900]   P-O-D-I-U-M.com/twit.
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:59.420]   We thank podium so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:07.900]   VR is, any of you still using VR at any way, shape or form, like for fun, for recreation?
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:14.420]   I busted out every once in a while when someone hasn't ever seen VR and they use it for five
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:15.420]   minutes.
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:16.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:23.500]   We have an Oculus Rift, the original, and we had an HTC Vive.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:26.620]   When I first used it, it was very cool, really neat.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:32.020]   It made me look crazy and I just lost interest in one of the sweaty old helmet and running
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:33.020]   into walls and stuff.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:37.580]   The kid, 19-year-old Michael, his friends would come over for a while.
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.980]   They would do a lot of beat saber and stuff.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:41.940]   They lost interest.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.580]   It feels like some of the steam has gone out of the VR revolution.
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:49.140]   That's not, by the way, sales have not gone down.
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:52.580]   Because parents are still buying it for their kids because they think it's cool.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:53.580]   Parents like it.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:58.500]   No, I mean, parents buy stuff for kids because they saw it on TV or they saw it in their
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.500]   favorite TV show or something like that.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:04.420]   So they think it's the thing and the kid gets in the kids like, "Yeah, this is cool."
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:08.700]   And it ends up like all of us that bought Osmo pockets.
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:09.700]   Yes.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.580]   Fantastic camera for five minutes.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.580]   It was dope tech.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.820]   It was so cool.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:18.380]   It triggered that nerthing in you that I need that right now.
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:22.620]   I swear to you, I used it four times and it's in the bottom of my back.
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:23.620]   I gave it to Otok.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.620]   I still take it.
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:25.620]   I gave mine to Otok.
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:26.620]   I took it.
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:27.620]   Same thing.
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:28.620]   I got an Insta360.
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:30.060]   I got a Theta.
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:34.700]   I keep buying these 360 degree cameras.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:35.900]   You used it more than four times.
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.660]   I remember there were a few videos.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.660]   Five times.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:45.620]   Okay, I brought my Theta, my Rico Theta, which is a pretty good 360 to the Galapagos
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:50.100]   because I thought, "Well, this, I want to always have this in Machu Picchu."
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:51.700]   And I haven't looked at those videos.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.780]   And I didn't break it out again after that.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:58.020]   I did a review of the Machu and we were using the Insta360.
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:19:59.220]   We were using Anthony's personal one.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.700]   I said, "No, no, we should own one."
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.220]   So I bought it.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.860]   It hasn't been used since.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:08.300]   It's just there's things that, and partly because really to use that, you have the best
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:14.740]   results put on the helmet so you can look around and the Galapagos.
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:17.740]   The only time I used three, six degree cameras.
[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:18.740]   Do you?
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:19.740]   And do you use it?
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.980]   I'm in a box.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:26.460]   The only time I used VR is when I go into an automaker's design studio and they want
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.060]   to show me something cool that they're working on.
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:33.620]   Yeah, I remember when we went to Ford many years ago, five, six years ago, we went to
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.260]   the studio and there, and this was early days.
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:39.420]   They were using it.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:42.700]   But and yet I think there's still the impression this is the next big thing.
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:48.500]   Apple has been saying AR, AR, for a long time.
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:55.500]   Ming Chico who is of course the supply chain analyst who has the best connections in Asia
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:01.220]   has put out a research note saying Apple's going to release its first.
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:06.780]   Now he says AR, I'm going to say mixed reality headset fourth quarter of next year.
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.900]   So a year from now.
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:09.900]   He knows a lot about it.
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:15.780]   He says it'll have two processors, the same level of computing power as their M1 and then
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:19.140]   one lower end chip to handle input from sensors.
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.220]   The headset.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.460]   So this is the interesting thing.
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.820]   This first one from Apple is like a VR helmet.
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:25.820]   It's not glass.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.180]   It's not spectacles.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:30.020]   You don't see through it, but it has six to eight.
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:35.860]   He says optical modules, in other words, cameras that will simultaneously provide continuous
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:38.760]   video see through AR services.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:44.820]   So you'll be able to walk around basically watching TV of your life.
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:45.820]   You won't see the real world.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:49.480]   You'll see it through these lenses.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.780]   He said the headset would have two 4K.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:59.100]   He said I don't know if I can believe this micro OLED displays from Sony.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:03.020]   That would be very, very much state of the art next year would also at least based on
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.060]   the cost of micro LED now.
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:09.400]   It would be a fairly expensive thing although they're small.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:15.000]   Is this Apple throwing spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks?
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   They seem to see.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   Yes and no.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   Yes and no.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.600]   You think about one thing that Apple has always been very good at and it's things for
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.600]   accessibility.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.600]   Okay.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:31.600]   So as you become low vision, imagine instead of thicker, thicker glasses, you could wear
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.600]   something like this that would help you with your vision.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.220]   You still got see through reality, right?
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:44.100]   But you have some heads up display to still Sam's industry mixed in with your reality.
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:50.140]   Think of what we see in an Apache or what we see in some of the Abrams tanks and things
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:55.500]   like that where you're wearing an Oculus, no pun intended.
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:58.000]   But to give you some assistance, right?
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.020]   You're adding information, not just taking over your reality.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:08.580]   So I can see something like that coming into play and this going to start big and eventually
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:13.340]   get watered down back into the glasses that everybody's been wanting.
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:19.380]   But when we were all being glass holes back, you know, a few years back, that was the thought.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:25.020]   You know, Apple likes to take the thought and turn it into function and I mean, if you
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:30.860]   could make these things look like spectacles, even if their Clark Kent big thick black spectacles,
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:31.860]   that would be good.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:32.860]   I don't think we have the technology.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.980]   I think that's the only thing you're going to start out with a headset or an MR headset.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:39.180]   I love your new, I hope you get the patent.
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.340]   I'll write that down and mix reality.
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:42.900]   Oh, I think it's a common it's commonly used actually.
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:43.900]   Right.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:48.620]   So being able to take something like that and then slowly work it down to where we can get
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:51.820]   to, you know, be spectacle used, that'll be dope.
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:56.340]   But that's the really that's the starting out starting out with something that will work
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:02.620]   from an accessibility standpoint or even maybe some research type standpoint.
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.220]   Those would be fantastic.
[01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:07.860]   The rumor was that they were going to do these kind of mixed reality V, basically a
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:13.020]   VR headset with pass through next year and then the year after, which seems a very aggressive
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.740]   timeline, they would have these spectacle like devices that are glass with a heads up
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:18.740]   display.
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:19.900]   I don't think we're even close to.
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.380]   Unless it's true AR, I don't want it.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.380]   I agree.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.820]   I don't care how high resolution your screens are.
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.420]   I don't want to watch my life cutting off my peripheral vision.
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:28.420]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:29.420]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:30.420]   It's a it's a square.
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:31.900]   I don't want to screen actually inches from my face.
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.140]   It could have better for a professional.
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:34.140]   It could be better.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:39.140]   Those sensors are going to maybe help you spread it out a little bit.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.540]   Also, it will be really cool to as a low vision person, right?
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:43.540]   I see.
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:45.140]   Can you read that sign over there for me?
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:48.380]   And it knows with when you're looking at because it's, you know, looking at your office.
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:50.340]   Well, there's all I mean, I can think of a lot of use cases.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:51.340]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:52.340]   I'm in Russia.
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:53.340]   I can't read Cyrillic.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:59.460]   You are glasses, everything's in English because it's translating like Google lens as we go.
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:02.420]   There's lots of credible uses for it.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:04.060]   I just don't know.
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:11.300]   The other thing and there's really a societal problem with anything with cameras on it.
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.580]   Look how people got beat up for wearing Google glass.
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:16.700]   I mean, I don't think that's that's going to go away.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:20.140]   If I'm walking around with something that is obviously recording you.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:24.340]   How was the comic books, the back of the comic books where we were.
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:25.340]   The X-rays specs.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:26.340]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:27.340]   The X-rays specs.
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:28.340]   I bought them, by the way.
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:29.340]   I bought them.
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:31.140]   I'll not work out for you, Leo.
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:32.540]   You can't see through dresses.
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:33.540]   I tried.
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:35.740]   Did you also get the sea monkeys, Leo?
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:36.820]   I didn't get the sea monkeys.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:37.820]   I love that stuff.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:38.820]   I did get the sea monkeys.
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:39.820]   I got the sea monkeys.
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:41.580]   I'm trying to remember this X-ray specs.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:43.300]   They just distorted stuff.
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.060]   It was like you were squining.
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:51.020]   So you might imagine that you were seeing something naked.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:55.460]   The other one that I got from the back of the comic books back then was the garlic gum.
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:56.460]   Oh, God.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.460]   Oh, yes.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.460]   Oh, yes.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:02.140]   And what happened was everybody knew what it was after a while.
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:07.140]   So we would take the Riggly's packet, remake it all nice so it's nice and perfect, and
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:10.380]   it would either be the garlic gum or the one with the mouse trap thing that would snap
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.380]   your finger.
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.380]   Well, I backfired the back.
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.380]   You were bad.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:16.380]   Absolutely.
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.380]   Anything.
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:21.180]   I was the self-addressed damned envelope king of my neighborhood.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:23.140]   You read somewhere.
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:28.300]   Send us, you know, six box top in the self-addressed damned envelope and you get the super golden
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:31.860]   Chris LP to play that stupid song.
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:33.860]   That was me.
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:35.380]   Kellogg still owes me a Mr. Potato Head.
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:36.380]   I got it.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:37.980]   I sent in 20 Kellogg's box tops.
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.140]   Never got my Mr. Potato Head.
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:42.500]   I got the gum that turned your mouth blue.
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:48.260]   I only had to send 399 to Walla Walla Washington.
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.260]   And there you go.
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:50.740]   And a self-addressed dumb envelope.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:51.900]   I'm good to go.
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.180]   So what is it about Walla Walla Washington that makes it so popular for those kinds of
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.180]   business?
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.020]   I miss hearing the name Walla Walla Washington.
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.020]   You stick around.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:01.020]   So I did in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.020]   Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:07.380]   And who knows the Chicago zip code for the Spiegel catalog?
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:08.940]   I bet everybody does.
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:11.460]   That's maybe that's just my age, but that's built burning.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.460]   I remember the Spiegel catalog.
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:14.460]   Right.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.460]   I don't remember the code.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.780]   Oh my God.
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:17.940]   Chicago, Illinois.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.980]   Actually, maybe it isn't.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:20.980]   It was 60609.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:21.980]   60609.
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:22.980]   Yeah, it was.
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:23.980]   It had 260609.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:24.980]   Oh my goodness.
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:31.900]   By the way, I just want to.
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:33.580]   This is the VR I want.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:34.940]   This is the view I want.
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.780]   This is Father Robert's view.
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:37.780]   Oh.
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:40.100]   But the Vatican with his 810 minute.
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:41.260]   What are you switching?
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.260]   The Pope's Streams.
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:43.260]   The inscription.
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:48.700]   I got a little PTZ camera and then a wide camera for the wide shot.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:51.060]   Yeah, that's just an ATM Mini Pro.
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.500]   And it was doing all the streaming for me.
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.260]   See, that's kind of a nice little setup.
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:56.020]   But a pretty place to be too.
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.740]   Look how pretty that is.
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.540]   It's a nice place to do live events.
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.540]   Although--
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:01.540]   What chapel is this?
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.540]   What is this?
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.980]   This is St. Ignatius, San Ignatius.
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:10.140]   And you're a Jesuit, so this is your home church, I think, right?
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:11.140]   Well, one of them.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.140]   One of them.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:15.220]   I needed a setup that was light because everything was raining.
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:19.060]   It had to be able to be put into one Pelican case.
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.700]   They're getting used to me.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.180]   All the churches at first wanted me to use their wireless.
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:27.380]   And I'm like, we're not broadcasting over wireless.
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.820]   Now they finally know--
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:30.020]   Are these the men in all the churches now?
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:30.700]   Ethernet.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.940]   We're doing Ethernet in every church.
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.260]   Oh, here he comes again.
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:35.660]   He's the guy with Ethernet.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:36.860]   Oh boy.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:37.780]   Oh boy.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.380]   We got all the ethernet.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:46.620]   So see this-- so I think that's one use for AR, VR, mixed reality
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:50.460]   is I could be somewhere else.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:50.820]   Correct.
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.020]   That would be cool.
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:54.940]   I don't want to wear it walking down the street in Petaloma.
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.020]   I know I get beat up.
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:56.740]   I know I would.
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:00.300]   It's a presentation device.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.660]   It's not-- it's not--
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:04.340]   Meta wants it to be a productivity device.
[01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:06.020]   It's not a productivity device.
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:09.420]   It's entertainment/presentation.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.740]   And to experience stuff that you couldn't--
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:16.660]   I mean, I would love to see the Sistine Chapel.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:17.740]   And someday I will.
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.380]   And you're going to be my guide.
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:23.140]   But until then, I think it's a pretty cool way
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:24.540]   to experience it.
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.900]   It's not everybody can actually--
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.380]   But even as a presentation device,
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:32.460]   though, I think it's still of dubious benefit.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:36.540]   I mean, last summer of 2020, during the height
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.740]   of the pandemic, there was an automaker
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.220]   that was making a big announcement.
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:44.100]   And they were doing this presentation through VR.
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:48.460]   And they actually sent out Oculus Quest--
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:50.740]   I don't know if it's Quest.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:51.980]   Some Oculus had that.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:52.980]   Yeah, the Quest 2.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:53.980]   The Quest 2.
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:54.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:57.140]   It was, I think it was the original Quest.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.140]   Quest.
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:01.060]   Or whatever their first standalone one
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:03.340]   was before the Quest 2.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:05.580]   Anyway, they sent these out to people.
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:08.700]   They sent out, I don't know, how many hundred of these things.
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:13.500]   And so I had to put it on and watch the presentation
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.340]   in this headset.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:18.020]   And the problem is, when I'm watching a presentation,
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:21.100]   one of the things I like to do is take some notes.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:24.580]   And you can't take notes.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:25.900]   I mean, I don't know about you.
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:29.140]   But I can't take notes while I'm sitting there with a headset
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:31.820]   on, and I can't see my notebook.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:36.700]   And it added nothing to the presentation
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:40.420]   compared to just watching it in a Zoom window.
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:43.740]   I mean, it was one thing that was kind of cool.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:49.140]   They had a driving part of it where the car went out
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:51.620]   and was driving around the city.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:54.940]   And they had a 360 camera set up in the passenger seat.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:58.020]   So I could sit there, and I could spin around in my chair
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:00.580]   and look around as if I was sitting in the passenger seat
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:03.620]   looking around and looking down at the infotainment system
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:04.780]   and stuff like that.
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:07.380]   That was one part that was kind and neat.
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:11.260]   But even that, after a few minutes, it was tiring
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:14.180]   and starting to make me a little nauseous.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:18.860]   So did you tilt your seat to duplicate the G-forces?
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:19.860]   I did.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.980]   And I have one of those gaming chairs
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:24.500]   that looks like a high performance seat in my office.
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.100]   Thank you, guys.
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.220]   Actually, I want to talk about-- so this is AR.
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:32.940]   I think you said this, Dr. Rock, Doc Rock.
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:36.020]   I think you said this, which is Apple
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:38.260]   needs something to follow up the iPhone.
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.740]   So they're going to throw stuff against the wall
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.940]   until something sticks.
[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.900]   And they've got enough money.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:45.780]   So they're doing health.
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.460]   And I think they're going to do all sorts of stuff
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.140]   with health with the Apple Watch.
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:50.380]   They're doing augmented reality.
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.540]   And maybe these will overlap.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.780]   AirPods might end up being an augmented reality device as well.
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:57.420]   And they're going to end up doing a car.
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.780]   So let's take a break.
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.060]   When we come back, because we've got the car guy here,
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:05.420]   let's talk about Project Titan, it's back in the news.
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:10.340]   And I think this is the third leg of the three-legged stool
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:13.300]   that Apple's trying to find the next thing.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:14.860]   I'm not sure which is going to succeed.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:17.900]   I'm curious what you all think as we continue.
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.700]   This week in tech, Samable Samad, principal researcher
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.700]   at the Guide House Insights, Father Robert Ballisair,
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:28.460]   the digital Jesuit, digitaljessowit.com.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:33.420]   And of course, Doc Rock from YouTube of YouTube fame.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:34.540]   Actually, before we take a break,
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:37.220]   I've got a little mini movie to show you.
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.620]   We had a great week this week on Twitch Watch.
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:44.620]   The top 10 most common passwords still in 2021.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:48.300]   One, two, three, four, five, six.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:51.900]   And when it comes to animal themes, dolphin.
[01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:52.780]   It's Oleo.
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:55.780]   It looks like monkey is out.
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.860]   Dolphin is a placed monkey.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:00.780]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:02.020]   This week in Google.
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:03.740]   We've got Sam Lesson.
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.620]   You may remember last week we were talking about Sam's plan
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:10.380]   with his venture capital firm to invest in creators.
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:13.140]   There are great creators out there that can use the capital.
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.980]   And then there's a whole bunch of missing things
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:18.980]   from models to liquidity options, whatever, that don't exist.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:20.940]   Yet, that we think will come to exist.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:24.340]   But we think the way you do that is by starting to just go
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:27.220]   and like help build the ecosystem around it over time.
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:28.500]   All about Android.
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:33.100]   Wear OS had a surge in the last quarter.
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:36.660]   Thanks to the Galaxy Watch 4, Sam's latest
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.780]   what wearable it came out a few months ago.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:43.620]   Wear OS is up to 17% of smartwatch shipments in Q3.
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:47.820]   This is up from only 4% for the previous quarter.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:49.100]   Security now.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:52.100]   The well-known internet domain registrar
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:56.100]   and more recently cloud hosting provider GoDaddy
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:00.380]   said that a hacker gained access to the personal information
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:06.380]   of more than 1.2 million customers.
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:11.460]   The last thing you want in a domain registrar is excitement.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:12.060]   To it.
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:16.700]   Things are rather excited over at GoDaddy right now.
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:17.700]   No, thank you.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:21.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:22.580]   I hope you watched.
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.860]   And if you didn't, well, we got a great week ahead
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:26.740]   with lots of fun stuff.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.540]   By the way, if you're not a member of Club Twit,
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:30.740]   you can see all this stuff ad-free, which
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:33.180]   makes it a lot more enjoyable.
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:36.940]   I think $7 a month gets you ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:38.620]   You won't hear me haranging you.
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:42.420]   You'll also get access to our wonderful Discord, which
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:45.060]   has channels for all kinds of topics.
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:47.300]   We're doing that Twit Cruise in July.
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:50.420]   And I think we're going to use the Discord service
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:53.500]   as a way to keep in touch with all the people on the cruise.
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.380]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.100]   Stacey had her first book group in there.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:59.660]   They're voting now on what the next book will be.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:02.620]   We've got Mary Jo Foley coming up with an ask me anything.
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:05.300]   There's lots of great events going on in the Discord.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.900]   And of course, the Twit Plus feed
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:08.940]   gives you feeds of all of those events,
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.420]   plus lots of other stuff that didn't
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:12.060]   make it to the podcast feed.
[01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:16.020]   All that $7 a month, twit.tv/club.
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:17.060]   Twit, thank you in advance.
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:19.740]   Your support really makes a big difference.
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:21.660]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:23.820]   I know this is it, the holiday season, right?
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.820]   You got all sorts of stuff you're mailing.
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:29.420]   Problem is, so does everybody else.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:31.460]   Do you want to get in line at the post office,
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:35.580]   find a place to park, holding your packages?
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:39.060]   Why would you do that when you can use Stamps.com?
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:42.020]   I mean, I love my postal folks, and I love saying hi to them.
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:44.500]   But I don't need to buy stamps.
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.540]   I don't need to mail packages at the post office.
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.980]   I can do everything I would do at the post office
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:51.060]   from my desk with Stamps.com.
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:55.740]   Skip that trip, dodge the Hack to Holiday traffic, save time,
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:58.500]   and you'll save money with Stamps.com.
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.420]   And now here's some really good news.
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:02.100]   Not only do you get the full services
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:03.900]   of the United States Postal Service,
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:09.060]   you get UPS, United Parcel Service as well, with Stamps.com.
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:11.860]   Now you can compare rates, print labels, access,
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:16.700]   exclusive discounts on both services all year long.
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:20.060]   Stamps.com has been a happy partner of this show now
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:20.940]   since 2012.
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:23.300]   We've been using them for even longer.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.980]   I'm a big fan.
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:27.420]   Whether you're selling online, you know,
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:30.340]   if you're an Etsy or an eBay or Amazon seller,
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:33.740]   the professionalism Stamps.com gives you is great.
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:36.220]   Your recipients get the text message saying the package
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:37.980]   is on the way, the package looks nice,
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:39.660]   your logo's printed right on it,
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:41.940]   you could print your logo, your return address,
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:44.220]   your sender's recipients address,
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.660]   all onto an envelope automatically.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:49.340]   Your computer, your printer and Stamps.com is all you need.
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:52.300]   You'll even get discounts, you can't get it the post office.
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:56.780]   40% up to 40% off United States Postal Service rates,
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:37:00.580]   up to 76% off UPS rates.
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.820]   Now that's fantastic.
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.500]   And never do you have to guess how much postage
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.180]   you're gonna get a great USB scale
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:10.460]   so you'll always know exactly how much postage to put on,
[01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:12.860]   spend not a penny more than you have to.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.100]   Go into the post office instead of using Stamps.com
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:18.740]   is like taking the stairs instead of the elevator.
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.460]   If you're just going up a couple of floors,
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.420]   all right, take the stairs.
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:24.020]   But if you walk up 30 flights a day,
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:27.020]   you need a break, you need Stamps.com.
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:29.500]   If you do a little bit of shipping in your life,
[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:32.620]   in your business, especially now during the holiday season,
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:34.980]   Stamps.com is a lifesaver.
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:35.940]   In fact, you're gonna like it so much,
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:37.340]   you're gonna wonder why you didn't start sooner.
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:41.540]   Go right now to Stamps.com to save time and money
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:42.500]   this holiday season.
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.740]   And I would suggest you take advantage of our special offer.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:47.860]   This is the best offer ever.
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:51.020]   Go to Stamps.com, click the, you know,
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:53.340]   hurt us on a podcast button,
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.580]   type in the offer code TWIT for Twit.
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:59.100]   You'll get a special offer with a four week trial
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:00.420]   of Stamps.com.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.820]   You get a bunch of free postage
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:03.820]   you can use over a few months period of time.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:06.380]   You get a digital scale, that scale I mentioned.
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.460]   No long term commitments, no contracts,
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:10.740]   just a great way to try Stamps.com.
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:11.940]   What an offer this is.
[01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:14.540]   Stamps.com, click the top of the page,
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:17.420]   enter the code TWIT,
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:20.140]   transform your life forever.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:25.140]   You will be very glad you did this with Stamps.com.
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:29.620]   So I'm sure Sam, you're following Project Titan.
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:31.780]   It's constantly in the news, which is interesting.
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:35.500]   I thought it was gonna go away Apple's car project.
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.220]   It seems to be changing a little bit.
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.500]   They've assigned Kevin Lynch now to run it,
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:41.980]   which is I think a sign.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:44.580]   He's the guy who put Apple Watch on the map.
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:47.460]   And he's the guy that you assigned to a new product
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:49.540]   when you're getting ready to launch it
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:51.380]   to make sure it launches with a bang.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:55.780]   They've been hiring people right and left
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:57.700]   from all sorts of companies, including Tesla.
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:59.540]   They just lose their battery guy.
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:05.580]   But is Project Titan on the high burner right now?
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:08.980]   Is that what you think?
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:12.100]   Certainly seems to be getting a little more attention again.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:15.100]   I wrote my first article about the Apple car
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:17.020]   back in February 2015.
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:23.020]   And I wrote a whole series of articles back in 2015 about this.
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:25.300]   And more or less stopped after that
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:26.740]   because there wasn't much else to say.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:29.740]   And frankly, most of what I wrote back then,
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:31.300]   looking back over it again,
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:35.940]   and I put a link in the rundown to my blog
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.940]   where I wrote this stuff, is still true today.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:43.020]   I think I have a very hard time believing
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.460]   that Apple is going to get into the business
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:48.620]   of building and selling cars to consumers.
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:54.060]   It is and always has been a very low margin business.
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:58.340]   With a few exceptions, there are a few companies
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:03.180]   that have managed to maintain very high margins
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:06.780]   in the business, brands like Porsche and Ferrari.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:11.020]   But there are also relatively low volume manufacturers
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:13.500]   compared to a Toyota or Volkswagen.
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.900]   And it just doesn't seem like the kind of business
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:19.100]   that Apple would want to get into.
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:23.180]   It's just not what Tim Cook likes to pursue.
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:27.340]   If they were to do this,
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:32.060]   the latest thing that Mark German published,
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:36.540]   which I thought to me seemed rather flawed in its thinking,
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:41.100]   was that they were going to build an autonomous vehicle,
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:44.060]   with no steering wheel, no pedals.
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:47.420]   And frankly, that is not,
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:52.980]   while I think we will have vehicles on the road
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:55.860]   that match that description in 2025,
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:58.620]   which is the timeline that German gave,
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:00.860]   those vehicles are going to be very limited
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:04.660]   in where they can operate and the conditions they can operate in.
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:06.980]   They'll be trucks, they'll be--
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:09.260]   - They'll be trucks, they'll be rubber taxis,
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:10.100]   - Rubber taxis, - Rubber taxis.
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:10.940]   - delivery vehicles.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.780]   - Yeah.
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:13.580]   - And they will operate in very specific operating domains.
[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.500]   - Like Waymo right now, you can't use it
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:16.860]   in the downtown San Francisco,
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:20.580]   you can only use it in the very much simpler avenues
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:22.300]   part of San Francisco.
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.740]   - Yeah, and that domain will expand.
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:26.340]   - Is that 'cause level four and level five
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:28.500]   is so hard to do that they're just not there?
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:32.180]   - It is, it's extremely difficult to do.
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:34.540]   The world is a very difficult place
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:39.180]   and for all of our flaws as human beings,
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.620]   we are shockingly good at doing perception
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:46.380]   of the world around us in ways that computers
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:50.580]   simply cannot handle with anywhere near the same degree
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:51.700]   of reliability.
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:55.980]   AI is not nearly good enough, not nearly reliable enough
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.780]   to do safety critical operations like this.
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.220]   Yeah, it's fine for doing facial recognition
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:04.820]   or a lot of other applications that's used for.
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:07.500]   But for something where the consequences
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:10.140]   of making a mistake mean that people die,
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:10.980]   - That's not good.
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:14.540]   - It's not anywhere close to being ready for that.
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:17.420]   And it probably will be for a long, long time.
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:19.620]   - Well, and there's also the issue of humans
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:21.540]   who are unpredictable.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:24.020]   And if you're a software trying to understand
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:26.460]   what's going on, it's kind of challenging
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:27.780]   to understand what a human is about.
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:29.620]   - And that actually has turned out
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:31.020]   to be one of the toughest parts of this.
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:34.460]   You can sort of break down the autonomous driving problem
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:37.180]   into four main steps, perception,
[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:38.740]   making sense of the world around you.
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:40.340]   What are the things,
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:42.500]   what are identifying all this stuff around you
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:45.380]   and where it is in physical space around you?
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:48.580]   Then prediction, predicting what all those other road users
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:51.500]   are going to do in the next three to five seconds.
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:54.580]   Then path planning, figuring out what is your path
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:56.060]   that you're gonna take through that environment
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:00.020]   and then control, actually executing the brakes
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:02.940]   and the steering and the acceleration
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.900]   to make that path happen.
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:07.660]   Well, it turns out that perception is really hard,
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:09.940]   but prediction is even harder.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:12.780]   Understanding what other road users are going to do
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:16.420]   in the next three to five seconds is really, really hard.
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:21.260]   And that's something that AI and software
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:23.060]   is still really struggling with.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:28.180]   And so I think if Apple were to go down this path,
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:32.900]   the way they're likely to do it is as a robo-taxi model,
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:35.980]   as a service model, I don't think you'll ever be,
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:37.580]   or at least not for a very long time,
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:41.100]   be able to go and buy an Apple car.
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:44.900]   Godly, if you look at how much money Uber is losing
[01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:46.300]   as a ride share,
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:47.420]   well, but there's a year.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:49.700]   Does it make money at this?
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.780]   Well, there's an important difference here.
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.620]   Apple is a company that goes after premium customers.
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.420]   Premium segments.
[01:43:56.420 --> 01:43:58.700]   Right, so they are not going to offer
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:00.700]   the kind of cheap Uber and Lyft rides
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:03.300]   that we became used to pre-pandemic.
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:06.380]   Even now, Apple or Uber and Lyft,
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:08.300]   they have raised their prices dramatically
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:09.140]   over the last several years.
[01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:09.980]   They're still losing money.
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:11.780]   And they're still losing money.
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:13.980]   Apple, the Apple customers,
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:17.220]   and the thing is doing the robo-taxi model,
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:19.580]   Apple can be very selective about where it operates.
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.780]   It doesn't have to be everywhere.
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:22.940]   It can be in some places like this.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:24.260]   It's just Beverly Hills.
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:26.460]   And it's just Beverly Hills in Miami,
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:28.740]   South Beach in Manhattan.
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:30.620]   It's not a billion dollar business,
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:31.460]   so I hate to say it.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:34.260]   That's a lot of money to spend for a very narrow business.
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:35.420]   It's going to be really tough
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:39.300]   to get the kind of revenues that Apple likes
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:40.780]   from this kind of business.
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:42.580]   Do you think Mark Gurman got it wrong?
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:46.300]   I mean, he's quoting anonymous sources.
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:48.780]   He says even within the Project Titan team,
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:51.460]   there's dispute over whether they'd be able to do it
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:55.300]   in that very advanced timeline 2025.
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:57.460]   But at the same time, he also says,
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:59.140]   and I think this is public record,
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:02.840]   the hires, they just hired a Tesla's former self-driving
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.900]   software director, CJ Moore,
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:07.500]   a climate system expert from Volvo,
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.220]   a manager from Daimler,
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.260]   battery engineers from Karma,
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:15.260]   sensor engineer from GM's crews, automotive safety.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:16.700]   I mean, they're on a--
[01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:19.620]   Yeah, but they've been doing that for the last seven years.
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:22.340]   They've hired a lot of people,
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:24.980]   with similar credentials over the last seven years.
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:27.660]   And a lot of those people are no longer there.
[01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:29.900]   They have, a lot of them have left.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:30.740]   So they're--
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:31.580]   They're almost as--
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.940]   Like people like Doug Field leaving,
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:35.820]   almost as fast as hiring, people are leaving.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.180]   Exactly, that's part of why they have to keep hiring
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:39.180]   because people keep leaving.
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:42.020]   They get frustrated that they can't do,
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:45.060]   they can't achieve the goal that they want.
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:48.420]   When is the fifth person to take charge in seven years?
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:51.940]   I think the journalists and the public at large
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:55.980]   are thinking of this possibly completely wrong.
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:59.260]   And if I'm right, I want to come back and moonwalk all over
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:00.100]   just do this.
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:01.620]   Let's record this right now.
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:02.780]   Doug Roth is a bad--
[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:05.020]   If I'm wrong, I'll admit it.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.540]   I'll admit it that I'm wrong.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:08.780]   I'm not afraid to admit that I'm wrong.
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:11.820]   I think that Apple's playing through the industry
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:14.300]   is going to be more like Texas Instruments
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:18.140]   or more like Ferruzia, if you know about digital cinema.
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:19.140]   Of course, yeah.
[01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:20.860]   Things like that.
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:23.940]   No, no, no, I meant--
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:26.700]   It was basically signal processing in your DVD players
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.860]   and all your Sony TV cameras.
[01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:30.620]   Good business for Ferruzia, yes.
[01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:32.540]   Right, right, they're fantastic.
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:37.780]   So if you take the M1 and its computational skills,
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:40.100]   it's neural engines, all that stuff, all right,
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.020]   you rebranded, I don't know, a car one,
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:44.140]   C1, auto one, whatever.
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:47.860]   And you become the digital signal processing
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:48.860]   in these cars.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:51.100]   And Sam, I know you were familiar with D-NON
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:53.700]   and the other chips that people used to put in their cars
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:55.100]   to make them faster.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:58.620]   Basically, it was recalculating fuel mixtures
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:00.780]   and shift lines and things like that.
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:04.700]   Imagine taking the tech that we have in an iPhone, an iPad,
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:08.140]   and M1-based processor and allowing your car
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:12.980]   to make processed decisions at a scale unheard of, OK?
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:15.300]   The other thing that Apple is really, really good with
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:16.140]   is sensors.
[01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:19.900]   So taking the six Sony cameras, Sony visual sensors
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:22.020]   that would have been in these goggles or something,
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:27.020]   and put them in a car, you're taking some of the safety
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:30.140]   things that you can add, not making necessarily autonomous,
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:33.940]   make vehicles safer, make vehicles more fuel efficient
[01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:37.380]   because you're making more educated decisions on fuel
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:39.900]   curves, making creature comfort better
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:45.380]   so that people can absorb things and pick up knowledge,
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:48.380]   order food, order things, check on their kids,
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:51.380]   all of the above stuff that we now do semi with the phone.
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:55.460]   If you become a processor or something
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:57.980]   that lives in these cars, you generate a billion dollar
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:00.380]   industry without having to build a whole car.
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.820]   You let everybody else build it.
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.740]   You become Firestone.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:06.140]   Yeah, you're absolutely right, Doc.
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:08.660]   I think that Apple, if they wanted to,
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:11.700]   could be a really important automotive supplier
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.940]   because they do have a lot of really key strengths.
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:18.540]   They're processing capability, making very high powered,
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:21.380]   very power efficient processors, which is key,
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:24.540]   especially when you're talking about electric vehicles,
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.620]   you need to have high performance per watt.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:29.980]   You don't want to be drawing too much power
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:30.980]   for your autonomous system.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:32.620]   It does solve a problem Apple has.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:35.340]   They have developed, they're sitting on a gold mine
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:36.980]   with this Apple Silicon.
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:40.900]   They don't want to give it to any other manufacturer of PCs.
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:43.300]   They want to make it exclusive to Max.
[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:44.500]   That's going to sell Max.
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.380]   But they would like, I bet you anything,
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:48.940]   they would like to do something with this gold mine
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:51.460]   besides build Macintashes.
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:52.860]   So that's it. The question is, though,
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:57.420]   would Apple want to sell chips to some other automaker?
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:49:00.380]   You know, where they're not in control of it?
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:01.940]   Yeah, I would be a little off-camera.
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:03.300]   I think if they offered them.
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:04.460]   It feels like it, yeah.
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:07.100]   I think if Apple offered to sell the chips,
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:08.620]   I think that there's a lot of automakers
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:11.060]   that would buy Apple Silicon.
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:11.900]   You know, today--
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.220]   If it is doing well that way, right?
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:14.940]   And Vinnie is doing really well.
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.780]   Qualcomm is picking up a whole bunch of business.
[01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:23.180]   NXP, TI, even Intel, mobile i.
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:25.020]   Are mostly architecture?
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:28.660]   It's a mix of a bunch of different things.
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:33.340]   I mean, just as Apple Silicon chips are not pure ARM.
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:34.180]   There's a lot of--
[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:37.460]   They all use ARM CPU cores, but they all have neural engines.
[01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:42.100]   They all have GPUs and tensor chips.
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:47.060]   So there's a wide variety of stuff that goes into these SOCs.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:50.100]   Father Robert, you're saying this isn't in Apple's DNA.
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:53.860]   They've never done anything that's not sold to the public before.
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:56.100]   The last time they did this was pre-jobs.
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:58.060]   It was under scully when they started
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:01.380]   allowing third parties to manufacture Apple clones.
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:04.860]   I don't see them doing this with a core technology like the M1.
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:07.900]   I see this more as this is Apple's IBM Play.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:09.620]   They're looking at a new industry,
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:11.060]   and they're saying, you know what?
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:14.380]   We can set ourselves up with so much IP
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:16.460]   that people will have to come to us to license
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:18.860]   for any self-driving technology.
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:21.300]   They don't want to sell to Silicon.
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.140]   That's a really interesting idea about--
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:24.060]   I'll take that--
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:25.540]   A patent portfolio.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:26.940]   That's very interesting.
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:28.220]   That's still better than thinking they're
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:29.380]   going to build a whole car.
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:31.500]   I just don't see them building a whole car.
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.380]   I'll take what Father Robert says.
[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:35.940]   Even for them giving chips, I don't
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:38.020]   mean selling them the chips with somebody else
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:39.580]   who's going to program it, have their hands in,
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:40.580]   and mess it up.
[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:41.980]   If Apple's going to give you a chip,
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:43.420]   they're going to do everything in house.
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:45.540]   They're going to build it per your spec
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:46.740]   and then maybe give it to you.
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:49.220]   They're not going to let you play with it and screw it up
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:50.620]   and then make them look bad.
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:51.740]   So yeah.
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:52.860]   So I agree with--
[01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:54.980]   Patent portfolio, that's interesting.
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:57.340]   And that's, by the way, how Qualcomm-- not just IBM,
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:50:59.220]   but Qualcomm makes most of its money.
[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:01.980]   So that's a very interesting idea.
[01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:03.380]   That's the gift I keep selling giving.
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:03.900]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:04.740]   Which one you have at IP?
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.900]   You milk it for generations.
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.580]   So the only challenge with that--
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:12.500]   and I agree, I think that that would be an interesting approach
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:13.900]   for Apple to take.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:16.580]   There's already a lot of competition
[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:20.540]   for all those pieces of that puzzle.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:23.340]   And does Apple actually have enough
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:27.140]   that's unique that others have to license?
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:27.980]   They have one piece.
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:29.900]   They said you've got a bunch of chip makers.
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.660]   There's 70 different--
[01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:35.860]   It would be chip IP, but maybe software--
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:38.260]   Self-driving software?
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:41.060]   But I believe there's Brand Wreck 2 though, right?
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:43.460]   So for instance, when you're going to go look for this new car,
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:45.260]   right, with four years down the line.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.100]   And you want to buy the car--
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:47.100]   It's Apple inside.
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.500]   It has Apple chips inside or whatever.
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:52.300]   Oh, the Brand Wreck just leveled up that car.
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:53.820]   It was like--
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:55.980]   Is that enough for Apple?
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:58.740]   Maybe not, but it would help the manufacturers, right?
[01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:01.580]   Because remember, I remember wanting to grow up,
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:04.020]   get my own car that had Nakamichi sound.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:08.100]   Because the ghetto GM sound was just whack,
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:10.060]   and I wanted Nakamichi sound.
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:12.420]   And then it turned out later on we grew up.
[01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:14.140]   Bla-Pung 2, there's another one.
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:15.260]   You hear what I'm saying?
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:16.660]   But those were how you did it, right?
[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:18.340]   Or it came with the Corinthium lever.
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:20.740]   Remember the Chrysler Cordova, the first car
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:21.820]   with the Corinthium leather?
[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:23.580]   I think they invented Corinthium leather, actually.
[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:24.180]   Yeah, they did.
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:26.540]   Somebody went into Bible and marketing term.
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:28.420]   Yeah.
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:30.980]   But that was the Chrysler Cordova with--
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:31.660]   What's your name?
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:32.500]   Fantasy eyeliner.
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:33.620]   Ricardo Montes.
[01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:34.460]   Ricardo Montes.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.300]   Ricardo Montes.
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:37.260]   You were the Christler with the--
[01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:38.660]   Corinthium leather.
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:42.700]   Wait, was it the Chrysler that had that wooden accent around the car?
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.300]   Yes, that's the one.
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.820]   It's called the Cordova.
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:47.340]   Sam knows, because he got one.
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:48.940]   He got one in the garage.
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:50.140]   Never had a Cordova, but--
[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:52.180]   And I think they would play--
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:52.740]   Oh my god.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:55.580]   I just know, as a half Latino, every Latino man
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.140]   in the neighborhood wanted a Cordova,
[01:52:57.140 --> 01:53:01.100]   because there was a car with a good Latino name.
[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:02.100]   Jeez.
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:06.620]   I mean, just in chips, there's a huge market
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:08.700]   for automotive chips.
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:12.020]   Qualcomm had their investor day last week or the week before.
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:15.420]   And they have for their new Snapdragon ride platform,
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:19.060]   which is their chips for autonomous vehicles
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:20.900]   and paid-as, driver's list.
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:23.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:25.420]   This is the guy.
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:27.300]   That's the guy right there, bro.
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:30.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:32.380]   He even got it in brown.
[01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:33.380]   Oh, god.
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:34.380]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:35.220]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:36.740]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:37.820]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:41.580]   Yet it is on the highway where Cordova best answers might--
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:42.980]   Where's tattoo?
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:43.980]   And that was an awful car.
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:45.340]   You just got it all by the car.
[01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:45.840]   Was it?
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:46.940]   It looks like an awful car.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.380]   It was an awful car.
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:51.380]   Looks like a boat going down the highway.
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.860]   All you saw was Mac Detties and Angel flights
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:57.540]   and those collars that came out to your shoulders.
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:53:59.540]   Dude, that's still in the Hawaii right there.
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:01.380]   That is Hanama Bay.
[01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:03.220]   I have great confidence.
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:04.340]   Oh, I love Hanama Bay.
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:06.620]   That car weighed about 10 tons, by the way.
[01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:10.300]   Bro, who dug this up?
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.780]   This should be your safety yourself.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:13.820]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:17.940]   Quarkam has a $13 billion backlog of orders
[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:21.540]   for their Snapdragon ride platform or driver assist.
[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:23.420]   Is that because of chip shortage or--
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:24.940]   No, that's just--
[01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:27.180]   Yeah, they've put together what appears
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:30.300]   to be a really good silicon platform for these driver
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:30.780]   systems.
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:32.340]   So it's a common system.
[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:33.100]   It's a common system.
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:34.020]   They've got a lot of orders.
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:34.740]   I just remember.
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:35.820]   Apple's in this situation.
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:38.060]   They had the single most successful product
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.500]   of all time, probably.
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.620]   Certainly most successful consumer electronic product
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:42.740]   with the iPhone.
[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:45.540]   And they've got to appease the stock market,
[01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:47.340]   who's saying, well, what have you done for me lately?
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:48.580]   They need the next big thing.
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:51.180]   They're sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars of cash.
[01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:53.260]   It's perfectly reasonable.
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:54.700]   They've got so many chips.
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:56.980]   They can put them on black and red.
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:57.940]   And pass.
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.500]   They don't care.
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:01.620]   And so they're going to do AR.
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:02.900]   They're going to do cars.
[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:04.260]   They're going to do health.
[01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:06.700]   They may all flop.
[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:08.300]   But they've got to do something.
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:10.420]   And they've got enough money to try all three.
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:11.420]   I agree.
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:14.860]   I think the longest shot is the car.
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:17.460]   But I gauge the reward for success.
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:20.660]   AR, VR, you can make that into a consumer product.
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:21.260]   It's successful.
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:21.980]   You have huge ones.
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:24.060]   It's the closest thing to the iPhone.
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:25.020]   It's like-- Precisely.
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:26.020]   But the car--
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:27.020]   Natural extension.
[01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:29.140]   Even if the car was successful, they would never
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:30.580]   get the margins they would want.
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:33.460]   I mean, people compare it to Tesla.
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:36.860]   But remember, Tesla, last year they made $1.6 billion
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:41.300]   of incentives, only $721 million on actually selling cars.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:42.980]   Apple's not going to repeat that.
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:44.860]   So they don't want to sell a car.
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:47.860]   A car is going to be such a millstone around their neck
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:49.420]   come from the time.
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:51.380]   If they do anything, they want a service.
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:54.820]   They want mobility as a service.
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:56.700]   And even that is going to be a stretch,
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:56:02.220]   whether that's going to be enough to tip the scales for what
[01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:04.340]   they want out of a business.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:07.940]   They also, though, are looking strategically.
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:09.540]   And I think this is one of the things that's
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:12.220]   both challenging, but something that Apple embraces, which
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:14.700]   is skate where the puck is going.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:16.620]   It's just aiming five years in the future.
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.540]   What's the world going to look like?
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:20.300]   It's going to look like EVs, right?
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:22.100]   In fact, didn't Dodge just say they're
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:24.540]   phasing out the challenge and the charger?
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:26.460]   The end of 2023, the Hellcat is dead.
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:27.100]   Wow.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.140]   That mean that's the same thing, right?
[01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:30.940]   It's going to be EVs.
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:34.980]   It's going to be what's the future of personal car ownership?
[01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:37.660]   I was just getting ready to ask you that question.
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:40.700]   I believe that it's going to take us longer,
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:43.860]   but having lived in Japan and Korea
[01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:47.940]   and spend lengthy time in China, personal mobility
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:49.900]   is massive and is growing.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:52.340]   Right now, even just in bikes.
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:54.340]   And I think the last time I was on and said,
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:56.340]   when somebody brought up this really wicked scooter.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:57.980]   Oh, e-bikes are hot right now.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:56:59.620]   Micro mobility.
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:01.940]   Yeah, I believe micro--
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:05.620]   whatever he just said-- is the move.
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:09.420]   And because of Apple's styling, again, brand-wrecked,
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:13.900]   they could just do fantastic with an Apple something--
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:17.540]   type segue scooter with an Apple E-scooter.
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:20.860]   Yeah, when you get off it, that it's autonomous.
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:24.180]   It can drive itself to a charging--
[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:26.660]   And looking how bad traffic is everywhere.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:32.100]   I mean, H1 is a nightmare.
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:34.860]   And this is Hawaii.
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:36.900]   There's nowhere you can go where they don't say, oh, yeah,
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:39.220]   we have the worst traffic in the country.
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:41.940]   It's the largest parking lot in the town.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.740]   Car of ice.
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:46.300]   The only thing good about us is that the weather's not bad.
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:48.300]   At least you're not freezing it down.
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:51.180]   Wherever we can, what we need to do
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:53.660]   is move towards getting people out of cars
[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:56.140]   and getting them either into something
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:58.100]   with a smaller footprint, like micro mobility,
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:01.940]   whether it has bikes or scooters or rickshaws or something
[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:05.900]   like that, or into mass transit.
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:08.980]   And actually, it's a combination of all of these things.
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:11.580]   It needs to be an ecosystem, a mobility ecosystem.
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:14.420]   But maybe on demand self-driving vehicles
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.420]   would solve some of this problem.
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:17.820]   I don't think you're going to-- I wish.
[01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:18.580]   I don't know.
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:19.340]   I think it's too late.
[01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:21.740]   I wish we'd have trains for the long distance.
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:24.140]   The only way to do on demand?
[01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:28.060]   Like that, Leo would be micro rail.
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:30.820]   Because what we talked about about machines
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:32.820]   still having a hard time with decision and--
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:35.340]   No, but if everything's on demand,
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:37.020]   Alex Lindsay said a map, quickly.
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:40.700]   He wants a living room with a bed that just comes to his door.
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:43.100]   He gets in and wakes up in LA.
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:46.660]   And that's what the original promise of rail travel was.
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:48.140]   But I think we can give up on that now.
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:50.300]   We're not going to have that high speed.
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:52.260]   What is the current Californians
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:55.260]   trying to build a high speed rail between San Francisco and LA?
[01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:57.060]   And it's so sad, though, because if you've ever
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:59.700]   ridden a Shinkansen, you know that dope is dope.
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:02.620]   It's amazing that I love the trains over here.
[01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:05.020]   The trains in Italy are incredible.
[01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:06.820]   And the Shinkansen, the seat--
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:09.100]   OK, I'm a green car guy because I'm bigger.
[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:10.860]   I don't even try to use the regular car.
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:12.700]   So I always use green car.
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:16.420]   Those seats are better than many airplane first class.
[01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:18.700]   Don't you think in the US that trains left the station,
[01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:20.180]   it's over.
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:26.220]   I mean, it's over because it'll take us 30 years to do it.
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:28.180]   If we're going to do it, we have to do it now.
[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:30.580]   And right now, we can afford it.
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:33.300]   But we're too divided politically to do it.
[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:35.580]   The other thing is--
[01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:36.700]   now my brain just went dumb.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:40.340]   What do you call it when you take land back for better use?
[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:41.500]   Imminent domain.
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:43.100]   Imminent domain.
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:44.780]   Oh, you're talking about all kind of fights.
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:46.820]   Yes, because of the political divide.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:48.940]   So I think we could have fixed it.
[01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:52.940]   But right now, we're too busy on just Sony versus PlayStation
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:54.340]   and everything that comes up.
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:55.140]   It's always a fight.
[01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:56.340]   It's Mac PC.
[01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:59.060]   So we're never going to get enough people to agree on it.
[01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:02.500]   But I believe that if we did trips where we took people
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:04.620]   to go ride it for a couple of days
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:06.700]   and see what it's really like and how--
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:11.020]   How's that light rail project going in Hawaii right now?
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:13.260]   It's doing better.
[02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:15.180]   We're getting closer.
[02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:18.460]   We were a lot of money out because of idiot mistakes
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:20.420]   and because whenever you let construction people
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:22.580]   do the stuff in any city--
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:24.940]   and I don't know why Hawaii got the bad rap for it--
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:28.780]   but construction stuff has always been slightly riddled
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:30.300]   with a little bit of--
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:31.060]   But do you think--
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:31.780]   --underpending--
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:33.500]   Do you think that's actually ever going to be?
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:34.500]   I mean--
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:35.660]   Oh, yeah, it's almost done.
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:38.100]   I can see parts of it out the window.
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.740]   So it's good, but we just spent a lot of money
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:42.660]   because there was people trying to cheat.
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:43.980]   That's the part that's crazy.
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:45.780]   But the cars are in, the first set of stuff--
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:46.980]   Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:47.500]   That's great.
[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:50.380]   They did some Virgin rides last year.
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:51.700]   Pandemic slowed things down.
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:54.660]   But I think we'll be finishing about two more years.
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:56.180]   And it will help.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:58.060]   But I look at San Diego.
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:00:59.420]   San Diego--
[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:00.820]   Ben, I think it's awesome.
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:01.340]   Yeah.
[02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:01.620]   You know what I mean?
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:02.700]   Right there in the middle of the street.
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:03.220]   I love Lake Rail.
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:04.700]   So something like that--
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:05.220]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:06.980]   --I think that's a good start for us
[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:08.580]   and then we'll get people to see.
[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:10.220]   But oil's not going to let us do it.
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:11.340]   Airline's not going to do it.
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:14.380]   As long as those guys are greasing palms, we're screwed.
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:15.740]   We're never going to see it.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:18.740]   But all of us have experienced it, so we get it.
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:20.740]   I wish I can get more people to experience it.
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:24.820]   So then they'd be on the evangelistic move
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:28.460]   to try to get people into it, because it is amazing.
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:32.180]   On the plus side, though, we are seeing changes in cities
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:35.140]   over the last two years, especially a lot more cities
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:40.260]   putting in protected bike lanes for micromobility.
[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:44.620]   And the infrastructure bill that was just passed
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:48.940]   has $65 billion for mass transit upgrades.
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:52.820]   So even here in Detroit, we've got protected bike lanes
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:55.140]   in Detroit, in Motown.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:57.300]   If you can put protected bike lanes in Detroit,
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:02:00.260]   in the city of Detroit, you can put them anywhere.
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:03.220]   And that's the sort of thing we need to do.
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:08.180]   Because one of the challenges you have is what's known
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:09.300]   as induced demand.
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:11.140]   If you expand a road, more people
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:13.140]   will put cars in that space.
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:14.340]   It'll just fill right up.
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:17.140]   And you see that on the 405 in Southern California,
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:21.020]   or on the 101 or the 280 in the Bay Area.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:23.580]   I've had a lifelong fantasy.
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:26.780]   Ever since I was a kid, that cars would somehow go away.
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:29.340]   And these beautiful paved freeways
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:32.220]   would be open to bikes and now e-bikes.
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:33.980]   And that we'd all just do that.
[02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:34.860]   It would be so nice.
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:36.340]   But I don't dare ride a bicycle.
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:37.300]   I want to ride a bike.
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:39.100]   I love my e-bike.
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:40.140]   I want to ride a bicycle.
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:42.740]   But I don't dare because I'll get screened.
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:44.700]   That's why you need protected bike lanes,
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:47.540]   where there's a physical separation from the cars.
[02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:49.020]   And reduce the number of lanes for cars.
[02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:50.340]   And that's what I mean about protected lanes
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:51.460]   for autonomous vehicles.
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:53.460]   I think we might get that as well.
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:54.860]   We're just throwing a freeway.
[02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:57.860]   The one against the wall is only for autonomous vehicles.
[02:02:57.860 --> 02:02:59.980]   I think you guys are living in the fantasy.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:01.020]   We'll get some of that.
[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:01.620]   I don't dare to--
[02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:05.980]   They are currently developing a mobility corridor
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:07.340]   between Ann Arbor and Detroit.
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:09.620]   It's about a 40 mile stretch that will
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:15.140]   have protected lanes for transit and AVs
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:18.220]   and other types of vehicles that are transporting
[02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:19.620]   multiple people.
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:24.980]   And they've been doing testing on the technology
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:26.740]   for it for the last year or so.
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:29.020]   And I think next spring, they're supposed
[02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:34.380]   to start actually implementing that road along this route
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:35.700]   between Ann Arbor and Detroit.
[02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:37.460]   I'm crossing my fingers because I would love to--
[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:39.420]   Yeah, it would have been helpful because Ohio
[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:41.020]   State could have cried all the way home.
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:42.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:43.660]   That's just cold.
[02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:45.380]   That's just cruel.
[02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:49.100]   The future of transportation is one word.
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:49.860]   Hoverboards.
[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:51.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:53.180]   In there, I've done that.
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:55.780]   That's another form of micro mobility.
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:58.820]   Our show today brought to you by Ignite.
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.140]   All over the world, you just listen to our shows.
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:03.060]   You know this.
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:05.780]   Companies are being hit by ransomware attacks.
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:08.540]   They're valuable files held hostage.
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:10.540]   Of course, forced to decide, do you
[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:13.300]   want to pay the cyber criminals to get them back?
[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:17.460]   On average, even if you pay, it takes 23 days to recover,
[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:21.820]   23 days of disruption, downtime, and chaos.
[02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:24.820]   Just as the city of Atlanta, one of the early ransomware
[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:28.940]   attacks in 2018, shut down for five days.
[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:33.220]   Five days, ransomware can come for any company in any industry.
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:34.980]   But small to medium sized businesses
[02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:35.860]   get hurt the worst.
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:38.500]   With fewer cyber defenses, ransomware
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:41.420]   has more ways to sneak through.
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:42.940]   For small to medium sized businesses,
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:45.900]   particularly the downtime and the reputational damage
[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:46.940]   could be devastating.
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:51.500]   Ignite, EGNYTE is the first ever file system.
[02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:53.500]   I love this idea.
[02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:57.780]   With sophisticated ransomware, detection and recovery tools
[02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:59.940]   fully baked in.
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:03.180]   A file system, it lets your teams create and share documents
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:07.460]   in Microsoft 365, Google Docs, Slack, Salesforce, DocuSign,
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:07.900]   whatever.
[02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:12.340]   Gotless others, but still keeps your company's data safe.
[02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:14.060]   And I have to tell you, most security software,
[02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:18.020]   the user experience is less than perfect, horrible, frankly.
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:19.300]   That's not the case with Ignite.
[02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:20.820]   Ignite is a security tool.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:23.980]   Your teams will actually love using.
[02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:27.180]   And because they're ransomware detection and mitigation
[02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:29.660]   runs in the background, your team
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:30.860]   can work without disruption.
[02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:32.580]   They don't have to pay attention.
[02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:33.820]   But meanwhile, behind the scenes,
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:36.700]   Ignite is giving companies with limited IT and security
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:38.700]   staff the power of much larger teams.
[02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:40.260]   You'll get total visibility.
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:44.540]   You'll know exactly where key documents are, who has access.
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:46.780]   You can automatically detect more than 2,000
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:50.660]   ransomware variants and flag unusual behaviors.
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:53.540]   It's completely turnkey, no on-site hardware,
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:55.420]   no software even needed.
[02:05:55.420 --> 02:05:58.100]   Shut down compromised accounts, quickly identified
[02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:01.420]   and restore encrypted files, restore encrypted files.
[02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:02.980]   Those are three words you ought to love,
[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:05.660]   all from a single cloud-based platform.
[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:07.420]   And of course, rapid recovery.
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:09.620]   If ransomware does happen to sneak through,
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:12.420]   you can restore your files fast to be back up and running
[02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:18.100]   in hours, not days without having to pay the bad guys a penny.
[02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:19.660]   Ransomware attacks are inevitable.
[02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:22.060]   Losing your valuable data doesn't have to be.
[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:25.380]   The right preparation is everything.
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:27.860]   With Ignite, you won't need a specialized security ops
[02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:28.820]   team to keep up.
[02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:31.380]   The system is always learning, always adapting
[02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:31.980]   to new threats.
[02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:34.460]   Your team does business just like they always have.
[02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:37.100]   And you can rest easy.
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.740]   Learn more about how Ignite can protect your business
[02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:43.380]   from ransomware and see why Ignite is rated number one
[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:47.540]   for data security by real customers in G2 Crowd.

[02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:05.140]   Welcome to the Twitch family.
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:06.700]   I think this is their first ad.
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:07.340]   We're great.
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:08.580]   Glad to have you.

[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:17.180]   [SIGHS]
[02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:20.060]   You've managed to make this a show that
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:21.980]   had plenty to talk about.
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:25.020]   You guys, in fact, I haven't even--
[02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:27.620]   I've got-- how many hours more can we go?
[02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:30.300]   I've got so many more stories here.
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:32.340]   Well, I mean, we could spend another hour
[02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:33.860]   talking about rich Corinthian leather.
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:36.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:40.020]   Couple of quickies.
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:43.340]   The iPhone 5G modem, not going to be from Intel,
[02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:44.460]   starting in a couple of years.
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:48.260]   TSMC is going to build it on Apple's designs.
[02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:49.140]   That was inevitable.
[02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:51.100]   Galaxy Note is officially dead.
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:54.860]   Samsung reportedly ending production on the Note 20
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:56.980]   with no plans for a 2020 model.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:57.900]   Makes sense.
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:07:58.540]   I guess.
[02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:00.940]   They've got a big phone.
[02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:03.300]   It was a proof of concept, and they proved the concept.
[02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:03.740]   They proved it.
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:04.140]   They proved it.
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:06.500]   The player victory is now a successful move on.
[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:08.380]   Yeah, they proved it.
[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:11.580]   Watch this week as Adam Moseri, the head of Instagram,
[02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:15.180]   testifies in front of the Senate on teen mental health.
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:16.300]   Couldn't ask a better guy.
[02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:19.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:20.500]   Meanwhile, I love this.
[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:24.260]   The CEO of cosmetics company Lush
[02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:29.460]   is deleting Facebook, TikTok, and Snapchat accounts
[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:32.020]   because they're worried about teen mental health harms.
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:35.420]   They say, he says, I'm happy to lose $13 million.
[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:36.860]   This is the right thing to do.
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:37.380]   Bravo.
[02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:38.100]   I saw that.
[02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:38.580]   Good for you.
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:39.060]   I saw that.
[02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:40.420]   Good for you.
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:42.180]   I hope it's not just lip service.
[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:43.380]   It comes back in three weeks.
[02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:45.260]   But I think that's good.
[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:47.140]   That's doing something about it.
[02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:51.060]   Germany is planning a phase out the sale of internal combustion
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:54.860]   engine vehicles by 2030.
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:56.140]   This is going to happen, Sam.
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:59.340]   Are we really, really going to be all electric or something
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:08:59.860]   and helium?
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:01.060]   I don't know what.
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:01.700]   Yeah.
[02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:02.700]   Yeah.
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:06.740]   So sooner rather than later, somewhere
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:12.180]   between 2030 and 2040, we will be predominantly electric.
[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:14.060]   Just forward as an example.
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:17.420]   In the last year, they've gone from projecting--
[02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:21.780]   we'll be about 20% EV sales in 2030 to this past spring.
[02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:23.140]   They were saying 40%.
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:25.420]   And now the conversations I've had with people who say,
[02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:29.620]   internally, their target is now well over 50% by 2030,
[02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:30.500]   globally.
[02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:32.460]   And they've already said they're going
[02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:36.460]   to be 100% across Europe, battery electric vehicles.
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:38.700]   Now we have an answer to the eternal question.
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:40.940]   Can rats play doom?
[02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:45.620]   Why not?
[02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:47.940]   They're pretty smart.
[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:52.020]   Two rats named, of course, Carmack and Romero
[02:09:52.020 --> 02:09:55.020]   have been trained to play doom.
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:58.940]   Victor Toth, a neuro engineer, has been working on this.
[02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:02.540]   For some time, he says, I built a VR setup for rodents
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:05.340]   from scratch, trained three rats in an automated fashion
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:08.740]   without manual intervention to reverse a corridor, rendered
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:10.340]   in the doom to engine.
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:13.820]   Although I did further implement mechanisms to train rats,
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:20.020]   to shoot monsters, I lacked the time to actually reinforce
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:20.620]   the behavior.
[02:10:20.620 --> 02:10:24.660]   Would you like to watch a little video of rats?
[02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:27.340]   I know you would playing doom.
[02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:31.140]   Leo, when future generations ask us what the pandemic was like,
[02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:33.060]   you just show them this and say, this
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:36.500]   is what people had to do to entertain themselves.
[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:38.380]   No bad guys yet.
[02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:42.580]   But given enough time, Victor's working on it.
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:46.380]   I think rats really like nine inch nails music is what I--
[02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:48.420]   He's just going forward.
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:51.180]   He's not doing anything training a rat.
[02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:53.380]   There's no turns or anything.
[02:10:53.380 --> 02:10:54.380]   Poor rat.
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:56.540]   He's stuck to the arm.
[02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:57.180]   Where's he going?
[02:10:57.180 --> 02:10:58.340]   He's stuck to an arm.
[02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:02.020]   And he asked to wear a humiliating striped jacket.
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:03.340]   So all in all--
[02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:04.860]   It looks better than some of my clothes.
[02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:08.260]   This is not a victory for the in the annals of science.
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:10.060]   This is not--
[02:11:10.060 --> 02:11:11.980]   This is an ignoble.
[02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:13.060]   This is an ignoble of--
[02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:13.940]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:14.620]   Enemy.
[02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:15.380]   No, he's shooting.
[02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:16.540]   He doesn't know how to shoot him.
[02:11:16.540 --> 02:11:17.220]   He doesn't know how.
[02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:17.700]   Come on, rat.
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:18.340]   Shoot him.
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:19.340]   Shoot him.
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:20.020]   Oh, there.
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:21.020]   OK.
[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:22.620]   He's going to know that works there.
[02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:23.420]   Farrows.
[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.340]   That's what that jacket looks like.
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:26.660]   Oh, he shot him.
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:28.620]   He shot him.
[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:29.660]   Now he's trying to figure--
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:30.180]   He's sleeping.
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:31.420]   He's like, does it know what to do?
[02:11:31.420 --> 02:11:32.340]   Should I go over him?
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:33.220]   Should I stand there?
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:33.740]   Nope.
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:34.100]   He's a rat.
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:35.180]   He wants to keep going.
[02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:37.220]   He wants to-- he says, I got somebody.
[02:11:37.220 --> 02:11:38.260]   Hey, there's food.
[02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:39.740]   Food.
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:41.380]   OK, enough with the rats.
[02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:47.220]   OK.
[02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:49.300]   You were supposed to have flying cars by now, Lee.
[02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:51.260]   Yeah, no, but we got rats that could play doom.
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:53.940]   And finally, if you--
[02:11:53.940 --> 02:11:57.980]   this is in response to a pseudo scientist who
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:04.700]   tweeted the observation that vaccinated English adults under 60
[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:07.500]   are dying at twice the rate of unvaccinated people
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:09.020]   the same age.
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:09.660]   Can it be?
[02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:10.460]   Is it possible?
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:14.260]   He's even got a graph to prove this in response
[02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:19.260]   to data scientists on the website coviddatascience.com.
[02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:23.980]   Proved that watching the 1984 Ghostbusters movie
[02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:28.540]   kills people at a much higher rate than people--
[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:30.340]   they're twice as likely to die as people
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:34.500]   who watch the latest Ghostbusters movie.
[02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:37.140]   Oh, it's that pesky correlation does not
[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:37.780]   equal causation.
[02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:42.220]   Yeah, it's something to do with the age of the people watching
[02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:43.500]   it, and I suspect.
[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:48.420]   And in the event, statistics is hard, but that just proves it.
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:52.180]   So don't believe anybody tells you not to get the vaccine.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:54.740]   Do it for us, please.
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:56.020]   You got my third shot.
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:57.860]   Yeah, you got boosted.
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:12:58.540]   I do believe--
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:12:59.700]   I do believe for my booster.
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:00.700]   You got yours too?
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:01.500]   Oh, man.
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:03.620]   So are you guys-- are you flipping?
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.860]   So I'm getting my booster when I get back to the States.
[02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:08.220]   I did Pfizer, so now I'm going to go with Moderna.
[02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:09.220]   Really?
[02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:09.580]   I got it.
[02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:12.300]   Mr. Law said that, and I was like, no, I'm sticking to all
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:14.340]   of the same thing, because it's just--
[02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:17.300]   I went with all Moderna just because Spikevax--
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:18.340]   I mean, come on.
[02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:20.380]   What was the name of the Pfizer?
[02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:21.860]   You got to go with Spikevax.
[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:26.500]   Moderna is the high-priced--
[02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:29.980]   It's the quality of any vaccine, and that's why I'm
[02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:31.020]   getting another.
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:32.020]   I want the cocktail.
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:34.740]   But I want the cocktail blended in any accident.
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:36.540]   I want all the value of a vaccine.
[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:37.540]   You're like one.
[02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:38.540]   Yeah, sure.
[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:39.540]   Yeah, just in case.
[02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:40.540]   Why not?
[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:41.540]   Yeah.
[02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:43.100]   What could possibly go wrong?
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:46.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:48.300]   There's a joke about four hours in there,
[02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:51.260]   but I'm going to leave it out completely.
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:52.460]   You guys, so much fun.
[02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:55.820]   Thank you for making a slow news week something more than
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:58.140]   interesting, something really great.
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:13:59.140]   Thank you.
[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:04.820]   DocRock, youtube.com/docrock, your purple, your magenta,
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:09.540]   anything you want to plug?
[02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:12.940]   No, I'm still just hanging away, creating all the things
[02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:14.540]   on the YouTube channel.
[02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:17.740]   Still piping away at the OECAM, just having a good time.
[02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:18.740]   I was going to ask.
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:19.300]   Do you want to--
[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:21.460]   You see, you're still doing the E-Cam?
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:22.220]   Yes, love it.
[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:23.460]   It is so much fun.
[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:25.860]   We're having just a massive good time.
[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:29.060]   And get ready to do vlogmas, which is probably going to mean
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:31.260]   no sleep till January.
[02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:32.380]   So there's that.
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:32.980]   Oh boy.
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:35.740]   Are you still doing the DocCAM kit?
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:37.060]   Is that still available?
[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:38.140]   Oh, yes, yes.
[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:38.580]   Always.
[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:42.340]   I'm always out here just showing people what to get,
[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:43.940]   if you want to build your studio up.
[02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:46.620]   And the funny thing is, where I'm getting a lot of the
[02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:49.140]   questions is, hey, I'm doing these Zoom meetings.
[02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:51.340]   And every time you come on Zoom, you look different.
[02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:52.540]   How come everybody--
[02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:53.980]   All of us, we have these things, right?
[02:14:53.980 --> 02:14:54.860]   So we look different.
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:57.540]   So now everybody has to get stuck with their Zoom thing.
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:59.700]   They're trying to fix their living room.
[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:00.300]   Or they're saying--
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:01.100]   We don't look different.
[02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:02.820]   We look better, baby.
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:03.660]   Yeah, we look better.
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:04.580]   Better.
[02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:05.380]   Yeah.
[02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:06.340]   And so that's what it is.
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:08.420]   Everyone's like, how can I look this good on Zoom?
[02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:09.780]   And I'm like, I can help you.
[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:12.020]   I can tell you one thing right away.
[02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:14.020]   Stop with the phony backgrounds.
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:14.980]   Have a real background.
[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:15.460]   Right.
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:15.860]   Wait a minute.
[02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:18.740]   Now it's Sam.
[02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:21.300]   I know you're not at the lake.
[02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:22.900]   Oh, it's not as expensive.
[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:23.980]   Actually, you've got to be explaining here.
[02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:25.260]   But the lighting here looks good.
[02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:26.660]   Yours looks good.
[02:15:26.660 --> 02:15:27.460]   I do.
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:29.180]   That's not a Zoom digital background, though, right?
[02:15:29.180 --> 02:15:30.820]   That's coming through your culture.
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:32.980]   Yeah, I'm using OBS in a green screen.
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:36.300]   OK, because normally somebody moves their head
[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:39.140]   and you see a hole in the green background.
[02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:40.580]   It's very distracting.
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:41.580]   You could have fooled me.
[02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:42.660]   You really could.
[02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:48.020]   I'm on so many Zoom meetings with people, or MS teams,
[02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:51.900]   or whatever through the course of the week.
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:55.340]   And every time they're all using virtual backgrounds,
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:56.580]   or just blurring their background,
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:16:00.460]   every time they move their head, it's so distracting.
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:01.460]   So wait a minute.
[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:05.460]   This whole time, you weren't in your basement this whole time?
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:06.740]   I am in my basement.
[02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:08.300]   My office is upstairs.
[02:16:08.300 --> 02:16:09.300]   Oh.
[02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:11.580]   Just the other one was my office.
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:14.980]   Is somebody just parked behind you?
[02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:18.020]   That's actually a photograph of my office, which is upstairs.
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:20.660]   Oh, god, I fooled me completely.
[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:22.780]   Father Robert, you're in a real studio.
[02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:23.300]   In the--
[02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:24.260]   I am in a real studio.
[02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:26.220]   And actually, I was looking at Sam's video,
[02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:27.980]   and I could see it in his hair.
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:30.420]   Yeah, that's the little place that I'm still trying to tweak.
[02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:31.420]   That's the little one.
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:32.420]   You know how you fix that, Sam?
[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:33.420]   Look, there you go.
[02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:34.420]   Just shed my head.
[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:35.420]   I had to do that.
[02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:36.420]   Oh, my god.
[02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:37.580]   I've never seen it without the hat.
[02:16:37.580 --> 02:16:39.780]   Oh, my god.
[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:42.460]   Other than that, or just wear a hat.
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:43.460]   That works.
[02:16:43.460 --> 02:16:45.540]   Well, one of these days, what's left here,
[02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:47.700]   will be gone anyway, so it won't matter.
[02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:49.980]   Sam, Principal Researcher, Guide House Insights,
[02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:51.220]   Wheelbearings.media.
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:52.700]   That's a great podcast.
[02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:55.420]   Roberto and Nicole are fantastic on that.
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:57.420]   If you love cars, subscribe.
[02:16:57.420 --> 02:17:00.380]   Anything you appear every week on the Tech Guy show,
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:01.380]   anything else?
[02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:02.380]   Yep.
[02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:07.660]   We actually, my colleagues and I at Guide House on the Transportation Research Team,
[02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:09.660]   we just started a podcast.
[02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:11.380]   We've been doing for a couple of years now.
[02:17:11.380 --> 02:17:13.980]   We've been doing every couple of weeks.
[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:21.100]   We keep internally, we keep a tracker of the big news items in the areas we cover.
[02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:25.980]   And we have a call every couple of weeks to go over some of those and have a conversation
[02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:26.980]   about it.
[02:17:26.980 --> 02:17:29.620]   And I said, well, why don't we just record this and put it out as a podcast?
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:32.340]   So we just published the first episode.
[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:34.980]   We'll have another one later this week.
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:37.580]   You can find it at ghtransportcast.com.
[02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:38.580]   Nice.
[02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:47.700]   And just look for Guide House and look for me and I'll, when the next one's up, I will
[02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:50.420]   put it on my Twitter and LinkedIn and elsewhere.
[02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:51.420]   Nice.
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:52.420]   Yeah, just follow.
[02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:55.020]   Sam, what's your Twitter handle?
[02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:56.580]   It's my name, Sam Abou El-Samad.
[02:17:56.580 --> 02:17:57.580]   Good luck.
[02:17:57.580 --> 02:17:58.580]   All spelling word.
[02:17:58.580 --> 02:17:59.580]   All right.
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:03.940]   Abou El-Samad correct.
[02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:05.780]   Sam is spelled with four M's.
[02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:06.780]   Yeah.
[02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:07.780]   No, no.
[02:18:07.780 --> 02:18:08.780]   Thanks, Sam.
[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:09.780]   One in the first name, one in the last.
[02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:10.780]   Great to have you.
[02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:15.020]   Father Robert Ballisier, the digital Jesuit, God, I miss you.
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:16.380]   Come visit us if you can.
[02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:17.380]   Absolutely.
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:20.460]   Yeah, I know you're going to have other things to do when you're in town.
[02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:21.860]   You've got a lot of four CEOs.
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.780]   Yeah, I don't want to bring anything back to the.
[02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:25.780]   Oh, don't don't come back after CES.
[02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:27.500]   But maybe we'll do a call.
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:29.980]   You do a call for CES.
[02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:32.020]   That might be OK to keep your distance.
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:33.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:34.020]   I'll zoom in.
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:35.020]   You're brave.
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:36.020]   You're a brave man.
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:37.020]   DigitalJazoo.com.
[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:39.620]   How's the Minecraft server going?
[02:18:39.620 --> 02:18:42.460]   So it actually, funny story.
[02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:44.860]   There was a flood in the data center and it blew up the server.
[02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:45.860]   Oh, no.
[02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:48.100]   Yeah, we're recovering everything right now.
[02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:51.060]   So no Valheim, no Fectorio, no.
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:52.060]   No, no, no.
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:57.460]   Like Rust is still up, Valheim is up, but the Minecraft server, literally drowned.
[02:18:57.460 --> 02:18:59.380]   So we need to try to--
[02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:01.780]   Yeah, I think we're probably going to lose the entire database.
[02:19:01.780 --> 02:19:02.300]   Wow.
[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:04.060]   Unfortunately, because it got the backups as well.
[02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:05.060]   Oh, no.
[02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:06.060]   But no, it's coming back.
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:07.060]   It's coming back.
[02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:08.060]   Wait a minute.
[02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:09.700]   You didn't have offsite backups?
[02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:12.260]   We did.
[02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:15.500]   Now, ask me if we verified the upside.
[02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:17.820]   Oh, no.
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:20.300]   Oh, that hurts.
[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:21.740]   That's painful.
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:22.580]   That was me.
[02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:23.580]   Painful.
[02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:24.780]   Ooh, wait.
[02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:27.900]   We can go back to like six months before the accident.
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:29.180]   And at that point, we're saying--
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:30.180]   No.
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:31.180]   Had you--
[02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:32.180]   It's not--
[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:35.420]   Did you have like fancy builds or was just people messing around?
[02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:36.460]   No, we had fancy builds.
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:38.180]   Yeah, you had like the Vatican, right?
[02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:39.180]   You had--
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:41.140]   Oh, that's sad.
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:43.100]   We'll go back to six weeks.
[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:44.100]   That's better than nothing.
[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:45.380]   No, no, six months.
[02:19:45.380 --> 02:19:46.820]   Oh.
[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:48.140]   Oh, nuts.
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:50.220]   No, but no, we're working with the community.
[02:19:50.220 --> 02:19:53.940]   It actually got to the point where so much of the map had been mined out that some people
[02:19:53.940 --> 02:19:56.020]   are saying we wouldn't mind starting over.
[02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:57.020]   Start over.
[02:19:57.020 --> 02:19:58.020]   You know what?
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:19:59.780]   They'll just do it again because that's the way it's been formed.
[02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:00.780]   Correct.
[02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:01.780]   Yeah, correct.
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:02.780]   That is cool.
[02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:03.780]   Yeah.
[02:20:03.780 --> 02:20:04.780]   Work it.
[02:20:04.780 --> 02:20:06.580]   How would people get involved in that if they want to do that?
[02:20:06.580 --> 02:20:12.180]   Well, you know, the easy thing is to go to the digitaljazwet.net or you can find me on
[02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:14.260]   twitter at twitter.com/podraestJ.
[02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:17.180]   You'll see all the projects that I'm working on.
[02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:19.740]   You'll find a nice, easy way to get into the community.
[02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:21.940]   It's a verified community through discipline.
[02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:22.940]   I love it because of that.
[02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:23.940]   You've set up a nice little bot.
[02:20:23.940 --> 02:20:24.940]   Yeah.
[02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:25.940]   Right.
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:28.500]   So you don't get nearly as many trolls and it's a lot easier to deal with those who start
[02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:29.500]   trollish behavior.
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:30.500]   Yeah.
[02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:35.340]   And also, I'm starting up a new show with David Hewitt, who used to play Dr. Rodney
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:36.820]   McKay in the Stargate universe.
[02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:38.380]   He's been in like shape of water.
[02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:40.180]   He's an actor, but he's a geek.
[02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:41.180]   Yeah, I know.
[02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:42.180]   Yeah.
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:43.180]   Yeah.
[02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:44.180]   Yeah.
[02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:45.180]   When's that?
[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:46.180]   Where's that going to be?
[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:47.180]   We're probably just going to start it on YouTube.
[02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:50.540]   We're doing the bones for it right now.
[02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:52.060]   We think we know what we want.
[02:20:52.060 --> 02:20:56.620]   We want it to be sort of an upbeat show, like the eternal optimist.
[02:20:56.620 --> 02:21:01.660]   So don't, you know, not going negative, not going on hating, showing a love for technology
[02:21:01.660 --> 02:21:02.660]   and science.
[02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:03.660]   Good.
[02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:04.660]   Good.
[02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:05.660]   That'll be fun.
[02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:06.660]   I'll look forward to that.
[02:21:06.660 --> 02:21:07.740]   Thank you all three of you.
[02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:08.740]   What a pleasure.
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:10.100]   What a pleasure.
[02:21:10.100 --> 02:21:11.100]   We do this.
[02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:12.100]   Yeah.
[02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:13.100]   A lot of fun.
[02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:17.180]   We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon, right after the tech guy show.
[02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:23.340]   It's usually about 230 PM Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2230 UTC.
[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:26.340]   I say those times because you can't watch it live.
[02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:32.900]   Oh, oh, oh, Father Robert, there's maybe, maybe your server is also underwater right
[02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:33.900]   now.
[02:21:33.900 --> 02:21:34.900]   Oh.
[02:21:34.900 --> 02:21:35.900]   Yeah.
[02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:37.900]   No, that's them trying to fix everything.
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:38.900]   Oh, okay.
[02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:39.900]   Okay.
[02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:41.900]   So I turned it over to the mods.
[02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:42.980]   I said, have fun.
[02:21:42.980 --> 02:21:43.980]   Go for it.
[02:21:43.980 --> 02:21:44.980]   And they're doing everything right now.
[02:21:44.980 --> 02:21:46.820]   So go visit digitaljazooet.com.
[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:47.820]   Later.
[02:21:47.820 --> 02:21:49.540]   When it's working later.
[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:52.260]   It's still underwater in the basement of Vatican.
[02:21:52.260 --> 02:21:53.260]   Yes.
[02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:54.260]   Yikes.
[02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:55.260]   Yikes.
[02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:58.460]   We did the show, as I said, at those times.
[02:21:58.460 --> 02:22:02.700]   So you can watch live if you go to live.twit.tv.
[02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:04.500]   People like to watch us do the show's live.
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:08.140]   Of course, you can always get on-demand versions of the show as well at Twit.tv.
[02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:12.100]   There's a YouTube channel dedicated to each show, including this week in tech.
[02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:18.140]   Or you can subscribe in your favorite podcast client and get it after the fact.
[02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:19.620]   We got a lot of shows.
[02:22:19.620 --> 02:22:20.620]   Check them all out.
[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:22.380]   Subscribe to them all.
[02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:25.900]   And if there's a show you particularly like, leave us a five-star review that really helps
[02:22:25.900 --> 02:22:27.460]   spread the word.
[02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:32.580]   Sometimes the newer shows always get more attention on iTunes and everywhere because
[02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:35.740]   they're getting all the new subscribers.
[02:22:35.740 --> 02:22:41.900]   Shows like ours that have been around for 15 years often kind of fall through the cracks,
[02:22:41.900 --> 02:22:43.940]   even though we still have lots and lots of listeners.
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:45.460]   I thank you.
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:47.380]   So a five-star review helps.
[02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:49.180]   Just reminds people.
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:53.220]   Twit's still here after all these years.
[02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:56.380]   Thanks to all our club Twit members who make this show possible.
[02:22:56.380 --> 02:22:57.380]   Twit.tv/club.
[02:22:57.380 --> 02:22:58.380]   Twit.
[02:22:58.380 --> 02:22:59.380]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:00.380]   Thanks for being here.
[02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:01.380]   We'll see you next time.
[02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:03.380]   Another Twit is in the game.
[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:04.380]   Bye-bye.
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:15.140]   [Music]
