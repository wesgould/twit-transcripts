[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. I have a really fun panel this week.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.340]   Lisa Schmeiser is here from ITPro today.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.640]   Lindsey Turrentine, super smart from CNET.

[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.680]   And do we have a lot to talk about?
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.440]   The Tech Titans testifying once again in Congress.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.060]   What does it mean? A fork in the road for PC architectures.
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.160]   And we're going to be streaming, not just movies,
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.200]   but games and soon even windows.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.920]   Plus, a PC that boots up from a vinyl disc.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.500]   It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.320]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech, the show where we talk about the weeks.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.240]   Tech news.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.920]   And this is the Liquid Consonant edition I just realized.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.640]   Everybody on this show's name begins with L.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.560]   I'm Leo.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.920]   That's Lindsey, Lindsey Turretine, senior vice president, content and audience.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.880]   At CNET.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.400]   Holy cow.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.600]   This is not the different job for you.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.280]   Just the title keeps shifting.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.520]   The title changed a teeny bit.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.400]   It's basically the same job with the same awesome team.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.720]   Nice.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.320]   Now a Red Venture publication, but that's good, right?
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.680]   That's a good thing.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.880]   Yeah, it's going to be good for you.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.360]   It's a good thing.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.680]   Good.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.280]   So nice to see you.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.120]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.040]   Lisa Schmeiser is also here.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.400]   Another Liquid Consonant, editor of ITPro today.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.560]   Good to see you, Lisa.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.600]   It's a pleasure to be here.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.080]   Thank you.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   No cookies today.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.600]   No Girl Scout cookies.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.200]   Not until Q1 2021.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.120]   Oh, I want my Samoas.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.240]   Have me on anytime after Martin Luther King day.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.600]   And I can probably connect you.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.400]   I didn't realize that.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.240]   For some reason I thought it was now,
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.520]   but it wouldn't make sense because everybody's making holiday cookies.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.080]   You got to say them when we're really desperate for sweets.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.560]   And also from Mac Break Weekly,
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.840]   we've been seeing a lot of her lately.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.640]   I'm thrilled.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.480]   Lori Gill, managing editor at imore.com.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.040]   How's it going?
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.680]   Hi, Lori.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.480]   You woke me up on a Sunday to join the show.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.720]   It's okay.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.200]   No, you wouldn't be still sleeping at 2.45 in the afternoon.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.160]   Wow, you know.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.760]   I'm a party girl.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.640]   Maybe in the days when you were singing in the punk clubs,
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.080]   but I doubt, in fact, there was a curve.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.840]   We're under curfew now.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.040]   Yeah, I know.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.840]   It's crazy.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.200]   We got to go to bed by 10.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.400]   Nobody's allowed to be out after 10.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.240]   Can you believe that?
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.280]   Wow.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.120]   It is a little bit weird.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.600]   Isn't it?
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.520]   It's a band-aid solution,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.240]   but if anything to try to remind people that we need to stop being in each other's presence,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   you know, anything that we can do to help.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.680]   I'm curious about what the motivation is.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.480]   Is it just to keep people from having parties?
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.040]   Is that basically?
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.920]   I think it has to be.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.920]   And bar clubs, bars, restaurants, big groups.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.760]   And even in your front things have been private parties.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.640]   Yeah, I think they're trying to keep people from having
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   parties at their house because that's where the spread is happening.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.160]   See, I question how effective a curfew will be because if you've got a gated community
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.240]   where everybody is operating under the premise that what other people don't know
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.000]   doesn't hurt them, you know, you could have parties going on that nobody cracks down on,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.640]   for example.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.720]   They've also said that the police are not going to really enforce this as much as they're going to be
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.640]   sort of like requesting and advising.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.360]   So nobody's going to get fined for doing it.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.240]   But, you know, we're kind of in this weird situation where
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.920]   we're having to do things to try to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.280]   but also trying to make people feel like they can continue their daily life.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.520]   And it's a real struggle because you can't go back from telling people that they can now,
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.240]   you know, go out to restaurants.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.560]   It's really difficult to go back from that because people are, they're tired of it,
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.400]   they're tired of the situation.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.560]   They want to be able to go to the bars and go out to restaurants and they don't like being
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.040]   told that they can't, even though they would have in March or April, now that they were
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.240]   allowed to and now having that taken back from them, that's just, it's just, it's kind of just
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.600]   part of our emotional state. People just don't want to do it anymore.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.240]   The same exact thing happened during the Spanish flu.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.480]   They, you know, they had mask mandates and then they took away the mask mandates and then they
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.240]   put the mandates back in and everybody went wild because they didn't want to have to wear masks
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.080]   anymore. We're just going through the same thing again.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.360]   Isn't that funny? A hundred years later, we're going through exactly.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.880]   It's a playbook hasn't changed. Well, there's one thing that's different.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.360]   In 1918, they didn't have TikTok houses.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.880]   They didn't have to worry about a bunch of 20-somethings getting together having massive
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.520]   parties. I honestly think this curfew is the TikTok curfew, to be honest.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.760]   Yeah. Yeah. You sure they didn't have like,
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.920]   ether parlors where people got together and...
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:52.560]   I'm going down to the ether parlor, man. Don't bug me. I got a...
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.360]   Yeah. Nobody is angry about parties. I have found actually then teenagers,
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.680]   because they so desperately want to go back to high school.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.680]   When they hear about 20-somethings having parties, they get pissed because they're like,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.680]   "You're ruining it for me." Knock it off. That's because you have good teenagers.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.000]   I don't think all teenagers feel that way. We're ruining it for all of us.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.920]   I think there are plenty of teenagers who just go, "Please, I just have to live my life. We have a
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.800]   senior. Michael's 18th. So his 18th... Poor kid, this is the worst year ever. His 18th birthday is
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.760]   Thursday. So Thanksgiving. We were going to have a lot of family in town. We were going to have
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.080]   everybody over for a big Thanksgiving dinner/18th birthday party. You know what he said last night,
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.240]   which is great. He says, "Okay, we'll have it on my 19th."
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.520]   What is this? Oh my God. I know. That is great. We have a senior also, and it is just
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.240]   such a bummer. Maybe they'll get to walk. There's a thin chance that maybe the vaccine
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.800]   will come out. Enough people will get it that by May, God, I would be nice if they could just...
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.280]   I don't know. I think that honestly, in my house, they don't care about walking. They
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.200]   care about missing the year. This is the year they're all going to be big and on campus and
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.040]   pull their senior pranks. They feel... It's just sad.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.080]   When you can't tape anybody to the flagpole when you're not...
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.280]   By a zone. Exactly. This doesn't work. These pranks were planned out.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:35.200]   TikTok House apparently is such a big deal that there is a company in LA that does TikTok House
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:44.800]   rental that was just... It was just like acquired... I'm trying to find the story because I didn't
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.640]   bookmark it because I didn't think it was consequential. But it kind of blew my mind. They
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.560]   were just acquired by another big company because there's so much money in TikTok House rentals.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:02.000]   Crazy. That's crazy. This world is so weird. We live in a very... We live in the weirdest timeline,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.680]   I think. I really wonder what's going to happen on Thanksgiving. There is some evidence that
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.120]   already the TSA is reporting last yesterday. A million people went through the checkpoints.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.400]   It's the first time a million people have been at the airport since May.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.040]   That people are traveling. This is not even quite Thanksgiving yet.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.000]   People are traveling. In fact, I think I saw a status of 38% of people plan to have a
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.760]   Thanksgiving with travel to a Thanksgiving with 10 or more people, which is exactly what the CDC
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.840]   is saying. Do not do. I don't know what Christmas is going to be like, but I'm afraid.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.920]   A lot of small funerals. That's what they say. Isn't that? Move. That's a nightmare.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:52.000]   All right. Let's get off that subject. Let's get back to TikTok. TikTok was complaining last week.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.120]   They were saying, "What happened? You were going to shut us down and we haven't heard from you."
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:05.280]   That was a mistake. It's like when I'm working with a trainer, I say, "Boy, that was easy. Never, ever."
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.040]   Don't poke the lion. Immediately, the Commerce Department says, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I forgot
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:24.800]   about you." The equiz... I don't know what's going on it. Walmart and Oracle were going to buy them.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.640]   I was even just saying that. It just makes me laugh. TikTok was saying, "Is that going to happen?
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:38.000]   I don't even know." I feel like they were doing that for a... To do a favor.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.880]   There seem to be... I will please try to get it not happening. You think that thing is going to...
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:54.560]   Yeah. It felt like it was at the time a political thing, and the president has moved on.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.000]   The National Security Advisor, Robert O'Brien, just gave a speech in Vietnam,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.200]   where he was saying, "Look, these court cases are ongoing. The federal government is going to wait
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.720]   for direction from the courts to tell us what we can and can't do." Right. Because Judge Beadlestone
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.080]   suspended that initial shutdown, which is supposed to happen Friday.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.680]   But it honestly seems like this was more of a saber rattling,
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.920]   hand-handed attempt to remind China that they can affect its commerce with the US than it is a
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.040]   serious matter of policy or any sort of tech acquisition. I mean, you're looking at a lame
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.560]   duck administration that says, "Oh, we're going to do this once the courts let us, but
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.720]   feasibly speaking, isn't this going to happen before January 20th?" They almost feel like they're
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.640]   thinking, "And with any luck, we won't have to worry about it in a couple of months."
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.800]   They painted themselves into a weird quarter.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.200]   One of the lawsuits that Judge Beadlestone ruled on was from three TikTok influencers who make
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.960]   their living on TikTok, who said, "Your Honor, if the Commerce Department cuts off TikTok servers,
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.400]   which was supposed to happen on Friday, that's going to cost us millions of dollars in revenue."
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:18.480]   And the judge said, "Yes, it's unfair to TikTok influencers." I just like saying Judge Beadlestone.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.840]   That's really the only reason I put that. I thought you were going to say you just like
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.480]   saying TikTok influencers, because that's a funny one too.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:31.600]   Yeah, that one too. We live in an interesting times, interesting world. That's all there is.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.640]   Did you, did any of you watch? I didn't even bother.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.240]   Zuckerberg and Dorsey testifying once again in front of Congress this week.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.480]   Why are you laughing?
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:48.400]   I'm laughing. So I'm married to another tech reporter at Tom's Guide, and he put up a screen
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:54.400]   grab of Jack Dorsey and Zuckerberg next to each other, side by side. And he tweeted,
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   "This looks like a show about a stranded lighthouse keeper and the robot butt, or he built to keep
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.080]   him company." Let me guess which is which. The one with the beard is the lighthouse keeper.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.800]   Yes.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.280]   Yes.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.600]   Look at you in that massively viral.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.800]   Oh, now I got to find this tweet.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.840]   I'm going to look for the tweet now and see if I can drop it into our Slack discussion,
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.200]   because this thing went massively viral. And I had people I haven't talked to in my timeline.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.800]   Here it is. Yeah.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.360]   Yeah, I got it. Lighthouse keeper and robot butler, Zuckerberg.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.560]   Is it Mike? Was it Mike's tweet? No.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.600]   No, somebody else took it.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.160]   Yeah. No, I will, oh, someone else.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.640]   It really does look like he looks like data. He really does.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.560]   No, I'm dropping in the original link for you for Skype now.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.040]   Oh, I can't do it from Skype. I don't have access to that.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:58.160]   What's, which one's, look at all of these. Which one's even Kenji Lopez got in there,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.320]   which one is your husband of all of them?
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.120]   It was Michaels, which, oh, he got the first one.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.200]   Oh, no. No. No. No.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.880]   Actors, they looked at their offering membership. Yeah.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.040]   Phillip Michaels is the first one. Yeah. The Senate hearing looks like the tail of a maroon,
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.080]   Lighthouse keeper and the robot butler he built to stay by loneliness.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.720]   Yeah. Oh my God, it really does.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.680]   Yeah. I think there's a movie there.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.040]   But that's creepy as hell.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.520]   I think the question I have about all of these hearings is how useful are they
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.840]   if you are talking to a bunch of legislators who still aren't quite up to date on the scope
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.320]   and the breadth of what these social networks do?
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.080]   So these were blatantly political the last time. Yes.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:47.440]   Was it again this time pretty much, I mean, and why even bother the elections over?
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.880]   What do they hope to gain at this point? Well, this is still an issue.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.360]   Yeah. I mean, it's, it's simple. I'm glad that we're talking about it.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.800]   The timing is probably not very useful because it's because of the lame duck session.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.080]   It's a lame duck. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.960]   But it's an important conversation. And I actually, I think that
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.800]   legislatures are starting to learn more about it. We've seen some really smart
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.920]   questions and takedowns and some really stupid ones too.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.480]   But it kind of depends on this legislator and if they've learned anything in this election
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.720]   cycle, it's that the internet matters. Yeah.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.720]   Yeah. The other point somebody made is where's Susan Wojcicki on this?
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.960]   Doesn't isn't YouTube at least as culpable as Facebook and Twitter at spreading election
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.240]   disinformation? Well, it's hard to measure culpability, but it's so important.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:43.200]   I mean, the algorithmic rabbit holes that people go down and never come out of are so damaging.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:52.080]   So I was at an event, I may have been RSA or it was another one where a senior leadership team
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.080]   from YouTube was speaking and they were supposed to be addressing the topic of,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.120]   here's how diversity helped us deal with concerns that were coming up with our YouTube for kids
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:08.880]   product. And I thought, oh, this ought to be good since how YouTube aims at offerings at children.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.680]   And again, pulls those kids into rabbit holes where they're just clicking.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.440]   And what was interesting is when the YouTube executives began speaking, I said, well, we were
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.040]   identifying a real problem with our YouTube kids product. And I thought, oh, this is great.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.360]   We're going to start talking about, oh, there were videos that were inserting up setting content
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.920]   or they weren't factual or they were marketing pages. And like, and they said, the problem is,
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.160]   the kids weren't spending enough time on the app. And it wasn't sticky enough.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.600]   So looking at how they were using it so we could boost engagement.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.640]   And we're just not, we're just not addictive enough. That's the problem.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.800]   We need to know about YouTube's priorities. They're.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.760]   And the argument I'm sure they'll make is we're not a publisher. We don't have to be responsible
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:58.800]   for the content on our platform. But yet, I think you do have an executive team at YouTube where
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.960]   engagement is, is there top concern over anything else?
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.000]   Well, I think you say the same thing on Facebook. I don't know about Twitter.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.720]   Twitter's priorities are more free speech than engagement, I think. But, but, but literally,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:17.680]   YouTube and Facebook's entire algorithmic system is designed to make increased engagement
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.920]   stickiness to get you to spend more time there, right?
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.840]   We were just in the house talking about this this morning that one of the interesting side
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.400]   effects of that is that so we know that fear and anger create engaging content and people do
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.840]   engage, which is why so many young men get radicalized on YouTube.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:39.760]   And it's, it's upsetting. But one of the things that it leaves is really bad marketing. So as we
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.000]   kind of go through time, I think when you start to think about Facebook as a product,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.800]   your emotional reaction to that product is generally negative now because when you log in,
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.880]   you see negative stuff. And I think over time, it's going to kill these brands.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.920]   Maybe not YouTube, but Facebook. It's really bad for them.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.200]   Yeah. Well, it's kind of needed for me. Because it's coming less.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.840]   And I don't think anybody at either Facebook or Twitter or YouTube is saying,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:11.360]   oh, yes, look for the most stuff that makes you angriest or look for the stuff that makes you
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.200]   more upset. They're simply saying it's easy. It's a simple thing. What content generates the
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.680]   most engagement? What do people stay watching the longest? What gets them to click more? What
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.520]   keeps them on the site longer? That's all you have to do. And it's the nature of humanity,
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.560]   Lindsey, that that means you're going to get the angry, crazy, all this stuff.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.040]   Yeah. And this is what happened to local news, right?
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.960]   You know, it was local television news. You know, film at 11, it was all about
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.520]   engagement and it ended up going to lowest common denominators. What happened?
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:52.080]   There's a Don Henley song, "Dirty Laundry." "Dirty Laundry." Now, I was recently rereading
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.520]   Neil Steffenson's book, "Fall" or "Dodgeon Hell." I love that book.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.160]   But there's the entire section in the middle where one of the characters, Sophia, as a college
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.400]   student, is going through part of the country. She's not used to being and negotiating with
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.520]   subculture. She's not used to. And what I thought was really interesting in that book was
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:19.440]   Stevenson uses Facebook as an adjective to describe a type of online or even face-to-face discourse
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.960]   that is all about getting that engagement rush as opposed to a substantive exchange of ideas.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.560]   And one of the geniuses of good sci-fi writers is they're really good at kind of
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.160]   anticipating where you're going to be five, 10, 15 years down the road. And the fact that he was
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.000]   already pegging social media as this, what is the opposite of the value add? Whatever the
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.440]   opposite of the value add? The value subtract. Yeah, the value subtract, I guess. But he was
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:51.520]   talking about like that. And I couldn't help but think about that with a lot of what we're looking
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:20:00.000]   at now in terms of what role did social media play. "Fall" also has, I love the book. It's a
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.520]   little, it's not maybe not a great novel. But as usual with Neil, the ideas are really provocative.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:13.040]   One of the other things people in fall do is they wear a mask, which is initially intended to
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:19.280]   defeat face recognition because it's so ubiquitous. But ultimately what ends up happening is you can
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.640]   project, you have, you own different persona, all signed with the crypto key and all that.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.520]   And you can project the persona, the person you want to be at the moment you're being it,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.160]   whether it's hanging out with your friends or at a store, that you completely control
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:41.920]   the person that is in public. And I thought that was a really interesting idea that's going to happen.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.680]   It is happening in a minor way. L'Oreal just released an app.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:53.040]   Did you see that? L'Oreal the makeup company. Now you can actually pay a small amount to look,
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:58.880]   to have an AI face done for your call. I almost did it for today just to try it,
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.320]   but then I didn't get around to it. So basically have L'Oreal do my makeup via machine.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:10.240]   It's L'Oreal, which is a makeup company, but it's virtual makeup. It's stuff that you would use
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:17.120]   in your Zoom call or your Twitter appearance. But this is like Snapchat filters. The only thing
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.000]   that's interesting about it is coming from a traditional brick-and-mortar makeup company, right?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.720]   Yeah, and you can use it for class. You can imagine high school kids using this in class.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   And you just don't put anything on. You just turn on your machine. It works pretty well.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:36.400]   I tried it on my phone. Does it? Yeah. Well, and of course, increasingly we're getting phones
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:44.880]   with Lidar built in, thanks to Apple, that will be even better at super-imposing stuff on your face.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.960]   It's just for women, though. What about us guys? Is there a L'Oreal man?
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.280]   It's a little bit too. I mean, there are women in the picture, but there's no reason you can't
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:59.360]   have yellow eyelashes. Yeah. That's a fascinating point, though. The marketing versus who might want
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.800]   to use it. Yeah, plenty of guys. So what's also interesting is they've made it, of course,
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   it's a Snapchat filter, but they've made it not only for Snapchat, but it's Google Duo,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:15.440]   for Instagram, for Snap Camera, which is Snapchat's Zoom plugin.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.920]   You can get volumizing capsules. You can get plump shot. What is that? Plump.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:31.600]   I think it's basically, it fills out, it's getting Botox or fillers. It fills out your lips with...
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.680]   And it works like it really looks like you have fillers?
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.480]   The makeup kind of flushes out your lips.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:48.240]   Movie stars have had this for years. It's democratizing it.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:54.160]   This was the dirty little secret of motion picture making for at least the last 10 years,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:23:02.320]   was it's often in the movie star's contract. You will make these modifications to the movie star
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:08.880]   before you publish the film. There's plenty of tools that will do this frame by frame,
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   but now, and if everybody could do it. And more importantly, you could do it in real time.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:21.360]   So you don't have to... It's smooth. When I was trying it, my description of it, it smooths out
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:29.840]   your face so aggressively that it's almost upset. Well, remember, Google stopped using the
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:35.760]   term beauty filter because they thought that that was pigeonholing. This is beauty is a
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.200]   lineless face. So they now just have another word for it that isn't judgmental.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.640]   Spooting? Yeah, something like that. But that is kind of...
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.720]   That's a no way, ageist.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:58.560]   Youth-inning. Just in time for fleets, which is not an enema.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:08.080]   Well, actually it is an enema, but it's also Twitter's disappearing tweets, which look exactly
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:13.520]   like Snapchat's disappearing tweets, which look exactly like Instagram's disappearing movies.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.400]   It's pretty much... They didn't even bother to make it look different.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:23.600]   It's a circle at the top of the Twitter scene. But what do you think of the name? Is that a good
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.120]   name? Lisa, you're a big sigh coming from Lisa's mindset.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:35.920]   I can see the logic where I can just imagine the meeting where someone said "fleet" because it rhymes
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.760]   with tweets. So we're maintaining our brand identity here. And it's fleeting.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.200]   And it's fleeting. Yeah, no, somebody really loves this name. I have a feeling someone in that
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.560]   organization is super excited about it. I'm sighing because I could imagine it so easily,
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:58.480]   and I hate that I could. I also hate the tweet that announced it. The thing you didn't tweet,
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.640]   but wanted to, but didn't, but got so close, but then you were like, "Nah, we have a place for that
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:10.480]   now, fleets rolling out there." That's going back to the whole lack of... Does this go back to the
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:16.800]   whole emotional engagement and getting that dopamine hit and... I don't think we should encourage
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.880]   people to tweet something they decided not to tweet in the first place. That's not what the
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.200]   world needs. Why don't you have a pause button instead, where you're like, "It's the other direction."
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.040]   Do you really want to tweet that? Yes. Think harder before you tweet that.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:36.160]   I do like the Apple Watch breathing exercise for a minute. If we're still sure at the end of it,
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.120]   then we will let you tweet it. I have a completely opposite opinion on this one.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.400]   You love fleets. I haven't made a single one yet, but my experience, I think, with rolling out new
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:54.320]   features, social media, is it in general, Twitter especially has tested the daylights out of anything
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.400]   that they roll out, and they're pretty certain it's going to be successful and that people want it.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.760]   Also, people who are really engaged in Twitter love to complain about changes,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.720]   but it'll catch you on it. I promise, you mark my words in a year if somebody takes away fleets,
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.480]   people will be really, really upset. I also think that if you're not into Instagram
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.280]   and you're into Twitter for different reasons, it gives you a chance to do some things that you
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.720]   wouldn't do on Instagram because Instagram isn't a news platform. It gives you a chance to use a
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.480]   different format for that kind of commentary. Let's say you don't want something to stay in
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.440]   your timeline forever. There are people who delete their timelines every week because they just don't
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.080]   want a record of it. Really? I wish. There are a lot of people who just every week go back and
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.880]   delete all their tweets because they just don't want it on the record.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.960]   That's actually- So now there's another way to do it.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.760]   I can't take credit for this insight, but I wish I could remember
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:52.000]   what you said it. But really, the problem, if you want to pinpoint the problem with Twitter,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.280]   is that it's ephemera. It is something that just hot take off the top of your head that really
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:06.400]   shouldn't last. It's water cooler talk that lasts forever, that's written on like stone.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.840]   Honestly, that's where most people get into trouble. It's the thing they said four years ago in just
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:21.280]   that now out of context is horrific. Or just sort of like your fleeting thoughts,
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:28.720]   just like you're saying. In some part, Twitter does- You do want to get those likes and those clicks
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.680]   and those engagement reactions, but sometimes you just want to say something to the world.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.240]   You just want to yell it into the void, but Twitter is not that void. But you do it anyway,
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.440]   and then later you go, "Oh, yeah, I forgot I did that. I'm going to take that down now."
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:50.000]   We've heard of some people who have their entire careers were destroyed because of some sort of
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.560]   flippant thing that they weren't thinking they didn't think about before they tweeted it.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:02.080]   24 hours later, it's still there, it's still horrible. Or maybe they took it down and put an
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:09.120]   apology there, but it's like if you have the option for it to just disappear after 24 hours,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   maybe people will forget that you said that really stupid thing that you didn't mean to say.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.480]   Or never notice in the first place. Or maybe even notice in the first place.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:27.200]   For that, there is this. Looks like you need Iceland.com. Are you familiar with this site?
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.240]   So this is an actual field in the middle of nowhere in Iceland with a giant speaker set up.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:41.440]   I am going to tap to scream. Please scream, "Respondent like the world's listening."
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:47.760]   And now I'm going to...
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:58.960]   Now I'm going to send my scream to Skokavas, South Finland. This is the screen name that's going to
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:07.200]   appear and I'm calling from Petaluma in the United States of America. Apparently, from all over the
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.400]   world, people are screaming. I'm a little surprised they don't have the country's rank by the frequency
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:20.000]   of who's screaming. And then I can even have them email me with a video of my scream.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   It was...
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.960]   So it's playing out of that yellow... Out of this yellow speaker in Iceland.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:37.840]   I just screamed in Iceland, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, I would love to know a breakdown. Who's screaming
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.800]   to me? Yeah. Like, is there a time I'm saying? It's like a sheep don't mind.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:49.040]   Does Bjork have access to all of those screams for a future project? I bet you this is from
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:55.040]   Bjork. What do you think? They moved the speaker around apparently so that no one...
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:02.240]   one neighborhood should have to suffer for too long. This started with COVID and I think it was
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:07.600]   Iceland's response to quarantine. To let it out. Let it out.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:14.800]   Anyway, that's what Twitter should have done. But instead it's preserved these screams that
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.400]   should have been sent to Iceland never to be heard again or actually preserved forever
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:28.080]   on Twitter. So to get back to this congressional testimony, this isn't about section 230.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:35.360]   This wasn't about anything but... I don't understand why they still even after the election want to
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:43.520]   grandstand. Fundraising is a 24/7 thing, man. Yeah, exactly. Just because the elections are over
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:49.440]   doesn't mean they don't want to keep their job, get somewhere bigger next year or four years from
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.920]   now or something like that. This is definitely something that's important for us to be.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:00.240]   This discussion does need to be had. I think what I've learned in the past year is that if you think
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:06.080]   about maybe a year ago or earlier this year, what these hearings were like, it was really like an
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:11.280]   eye-rolling peacock fest that just made you want to throw things at your television set or your
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   computer. And they've got...
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.800]   Or scream at Iceland. That's the case.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:21.680]   You want to scream to Iceland, yeah. They've gotten better. They're starting to realize
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.280]   that they actually have to ask important questions. And it's not just a place to say,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:33.520]   "Will you promise to do X, Y, and Z because that's my platform?" They don't do that as much.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.880]   They really are coming to the table now with like, "Okay, here's what our constituents are
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.560]   actually worried about. Here's what we've been researching." And there are people who are kind
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.840]   of behind the scenes telling them things. This is what's going on. This is what the issue is.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.960]   This is what we need to work on. And they're starting to bring that to the table now. And I
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.640]   think that we will see some real discussions being had about this sort of thing in the near future,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.160]   maybe within the next year.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:08.320]   So, I guess the question is, and maybe it was Ted Cruz who crystallized this, he asked Doris
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:14.480]   Jack Dorsey about Twitter's decision to add labels to the president's tweets about voter fraud.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:21.440]   Cruz said, "You're a publisher when you're doing that." He barked. "You're entitled to take a policy
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.640]   position, but you don't get to pretend you're not a publisher and therefore get special benefit
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:33.280]   under Section 230." That doesn't seem unfair just for those who are not following this,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.160]   something we've been talking about for months. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:46.080]   says, in effect, that just because you're publishing on the internet a comment section,
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:51.520]   a chatroom, Twitter, Facebook, doesn't mean you're a publisher. In fact, you're protected
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:58.240]   if you decide to delete content or not delete content, you can't be sued for what a third-party
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:04.720]   posts on your site. Now, clearly Facebook, YouTube, Twitter are publishers too of content that they
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.600]   create, but that most of the content on those sites are not created by them, so they're not
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:16.160]   liable for that. That many people consider is a foundational law that made the internet possible.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.360]   I know I wouldn't be able to have an IRC chatroom. If I could be sued for what people say in there,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:28.000]   I wouldn't have comments on a forum or on a YouTube post if I were be liable for what they say.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.640]   That protects me and has been a very important thing for the development of the internet.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.440]   But it is true that if you start acting like a publisher, you shouldn't have a safe harbor, right?
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:45.280]   And Leo, there's also something to consider, which is that just like you're saying,
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:52.880]   you wouldn't have a forum if you weren't protected, but there are lots of people who are harassed and
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:01.360]   have all kinds of horrible things said to them, said about them. And these non-publishers like
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.840]   Twitter and Facebook and stuff, they just shrug and say, "We didn't do it, so we're not going to
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.720]   really make a big deal about it." I think they get really nervous about policing it.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.240]   And this is a problem with 230, and I don't know what the solution is, but they get really
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.280]   nervous about policing it because I think that they are concerned that once they start to police
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:25.760]   in a detailed way, they are then liable to police everything, which they can't figure out how to do.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:31.360]   No, 230 specifically says, though, you can do that, and it doesn't make you a publisher.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:38.160]   And even if you act as a publisher in some aspects, that doesn't mean you're suddenly
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.040]   liable for content that third parties put on your site. I have a blog, I'm liable for the blog
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.880]   content, but I'm not liable under Section 230 for the comments on that blog. And that's one thing
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:54.320]   Ted Cruz is a little confused about, and there's very specifically a safe harbor so that you,
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.440]   this is the other thing that these guys, I think, don't understand. If you eliminate 230,
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:05.520]   that eliminates moderation because it's 230 that's protecting you when you moderate.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:12.480]   Yes? You don't, Lindsay, you think that it, any moderation?
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.280]   I'm trying to go back to my very, very early days on the internet, and I'm talking about like
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.080]   the year 2000, and how much time we spent kind of worrying about the degree to which
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:29.520]   we, meaning publishers, got involved at all, because the concern was if you start to get involved,
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.240]   then you are acting as a publisher. And deleting is one thing, and I think that we have evolved,
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:39.200]   the internet has evolved, and all of the understanding of laws, and this one in particular has evolved
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:45.040]   to allow us to do more, deleting to protect people. But there is still, but it could be argued,
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.520]   the opposite could be argued, which is that once you start to make decisions, and really
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.800]   detailed decisions about what is fair game, you're then responsible for all decisions,
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:00.160]   and you're acting as a publisher because you are editing. And so I think that the social media
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:06.880]   sites have had to try to navigate this, and they do it wrong a lot. But I think that 230 itself
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.720]   probably needs to evolve to give more flexibility to allow that safe harbor without publishers having
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   to worry about going a step too far and then becoming responsible for what people are saying
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:24.400]   on that platform. It's just a tough, tough question, because it's true. I think it's fair to say that
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:31.920]   Twitter is in many ways playing a communications role that's more similar to the phone company
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.800]   that I'm using. >> A common carrier instead of a publisher.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.240]   >> But it is not the same as a phone company because the record is permanent, and it's not
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:46.960]   one to one. So it is a difficult one. >> Yeah. To get into more of the Internet
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:55.120]   old-school thing, I actually remember in 1995, people were debating whether or not ISPs were
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:01.760]   considered publishers because they would allow people to put up bonkers websites. Actually,
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:08.000]   in 1995, I did a news story on Stormfront because they had rolled out their website,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.600]   and they had forums and were beginning to recruit. And the question was, the ISP that lets Stormfront
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:18.960]   run its operation, are they responsible as a publisher? And ultimately, they concluded no.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.360]   The whole point to a common carrier is it provides a service to anyone who can pay the fee,
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.480]   and there are terms and conditions for the service, but you can't just go in willy-nilly. It has to
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:34.560]   be something that's provably detrimental to the service. >> Well, that's interesting.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.480]   >> Wonder is if social media is going to get to the point where they're going to argue that
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:48.400]   they're more like an ISP in that they offer equal access. And as such, it's just whoever can
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:57.280]   pay to play gets to. Because it seems these are all companies that are fundamentally selling data,
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:03.440]   what they generate on the end, the harassment campaigns or the incorrect tweets or the Facebook
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:09.120]   groups that are used to organize. That's the user experience. But from a business model,
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:14.720]   every single one of these companies is in the business of harvesting data and then selling
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.480]   slice and dice data products to somebody else. >> So they're going to do everything.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.400]   >> There are two things here. There's the law, which is very clear. In fact, one of the things I'm
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:32.800]   so hesitant to modify 230 because it is so almost perfect in its very simplistic
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:40.240]   clear description. It's almost like a constitutional amendment. It's very simple. There's also,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.120]   though, public pressure. If you are publishing Stormfront, you may not be violating the law,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:54.080]   but you may also be subject to intense public pressure. And this is not to obviate the need
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.640]   for a society. In other ways, say, hey, we don't like that, you shouldn't do it.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.080]   But what they're saying is government should not get involved in this.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:08.160]   It's important to remember that the reason 230 exists was a lawsuit against prodigy.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:14.400]   That's how long ago this was. Prodigy, in an effort to provide, and I'm reading from Mike
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.400]   Masnick's excellent post on TechDirt.com, in order to provide a family-friendly environment,
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:27.600]   prodigy did some moderation of its message boards. In the lawsuit, Stratton Oakmont versus prodigy,
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:34.160]   the judge ruled that since prodigy did moderate the boards, it would be liable for anything
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:39.440]   it left up at the time that the state of the law was such that that was the case. So section 230
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:47.360]   was written to explicitly overrule that judicial decision so that sites like prodigy would not
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:53.440]   have liability if they moderated. It would give them the right to moderate without suddenly becoming
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:40:00.000]   a publisher. It's really, really important. Without that, I don't know if you have the internet.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.200]   There are a lot of lawsuits that were just preemptorally stopped because section 230,
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:13.440]   nope, you cannot sue Twitter for something Lisa's husband posts on there.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:22.080]   Mark Zuckerberg can't come up after Twitter for that. And that's right. That's the way it should
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.800]   be. He does look like data. It's nothing Mark Zuckerberg can do about it.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:33.920]   I think we ought to be careful about modifying it. I really makes me nervous because it is pretty
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:41.440]   close to, I feel pretty close to perfect. But that's, I'm just arguing against you a little bit,
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.400]   Lindsey, on that. Oh, that's totally fair. I'm not even sure you're arguing against me. I'm
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:53.600]   kind of exploring, in my own mind, how do we fix the problem, which is rampant spread of
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:59.360]   misinformation? It's sometimes intentionally. Exactly. And we're not there yet. I think that
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:05.200]   business interests are, in this case, counter to public interests. And I just hope that conversation
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.880]   keeps going. Yeah. Well, there's no question in my mind. You said what I was kind of groping at,
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.600]   which is that there's no incentive for businesses to address the sun lusts are going to lose money.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.880]   And to loop back to earlier comments, once Facebook loses brand equity, they're going to get very,
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:25.840]   very interested in addressing the public good. Yeah. I mean, there's no question in my mind that
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:32.000]   these guys have immense power. I don't know what the answer is. I don't know if they should be
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.560]   regulated or broke it up or I don't think those are good solutions either. That's the, to me,
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:43.920]   this is the biggest problem. And I'm going to, I'm going to include Google in this Facebook,
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:52.640]   Amazon. I'm going to throw in here. They have, you know, Twitter less so, to be honest.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.840]   There's only a few hundred million people. It's not that big a deal. And YouTube, these guys have
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:04.320]   immense power. And I think you could make the case that if Mark Zuckerberg decided he wanted
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:12.160]   candidate A to be the next president, he'd have a lot of ability to sway the country. Don't you think
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:18.960]   he could do it? Do we want some one person to have that ability? And yet what is the governmental
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:25.840]   remedy for that? I don't know. Yeah. This is a tough one. It's just, it's really hard stuff.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.240]   And we haven't, we haven't quite figured it out yet. And that's why I scream in Iceland.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   That's all there is to it. That's the reason. All right. Let's take a little bit break. This is the,
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.720]   the L word show, Lisa, Leo, Lindsay and Laurie.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:52.240]   I don't mean anything by that. I'm just saying. Oh, brand new sponsor. I want to welcome Tibco
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:58.640]   to the show. I had, I have to say, I had an education. I was spending some time with Tibco
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:06.240]   talking to them about what they do. And I was saying, well, what, what is it you do? And I think
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:13.280]   it's really important to understand how important a company like Tibco is in the modern world. If
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.920]   you're a, and I can, I can actually, I think I can do this by giving you some examples. If you're
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:24.320]   a company, nowadays, everything's instrumented, you know, you've got lots of information flooding in
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:31.280]   from your factories, from your stores, from your customers, tons of information all the time that
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.600]   I think if you're an executive, you look at and you say, I know if I could just somehow
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:42.480]   massage that information, connect that information, I could gain insights from it that would change
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:49.760]   how we do business. That's what Tibco does. They, they're three pillars to Tibco. They let you
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:59.600]   capture data, connect to that data, unify it, and then predict based on that data. Take an example,
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:06.560]   Panera, you know Panera, everybody knows Panera. So Panera's got a problem. It's called COVID-19.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.560]   All of a sudden these stores that were vibrant, thriving, people coming and going,
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.080]   nobody's coming in anymore. Nobody can come anymore. So Panera needed to know what do we do
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:25.040]   to change our business. They had the data. They used Tibco to unify the data, to analyze it,
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.000]   and they were able to figure out, oh, I know what we do. We create Panera bread grocery,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.560]   and they knew exactly what menu items, what, what, what products to cook, and what they could sell.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.360]   They were able to diversify their business during quarantine because they had a solid,
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:47.920]   flexible master data management foundation from Tibco. It supported quick updates, new product
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:53.680]   additions. You know the name Tibco I'm betting. You probably seen it on their Mercedes AMG
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:45:01.840]   Petronas F1 team, right? Seven World Championships. That's another good example of a huge amount of
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:09.200]   data. And F1 Formula One race car is instrumented to the, to the ninth level. I mean, every single
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:14.800]   thing on that car is setting out megabytes of information every second. Tons of information.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.880]   How do you use that information to tell you how to drive the car, how to tune the car, how to
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:27.040]   handle the next race with Tibco's deep technical expertise in connecting disparate systems,
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:33.360]   unifying the data, and then predicting outcomes with advanced analytics. They won seven World
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:39.440]   Championships. For the University of Iowa, as their hospital and clinics, they were able to use the
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:44.720]   data gathered from surgeries from patients. And they were, they were able to reduce their
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:50.880]   surgical site infections by 74%. That's what analytics can do for you. That's what Tibco
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.000]   can do for you. They solve tomorrow's impossible business problems by connecting seamlessly,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.920]   connecting any application device or data source. That's the first pillar, intelligently unifying
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.800]   that data. So you have better access, trust and control of it. That's the second pillar. And
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:12.320]   then confidently predicting business outcomes with real time data driven intelligence. This is
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:18.240]   business intelligence to the nth degree. This is the next level. Tibco gives businesses the things
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:23.440]   they need, the information they need to succeed. Data is there's no question about it. The
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:28.480]   transformative energy of the modern enterprise. And Tibco is there to help its customers unlock
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.920]   the value of their real time data to create a competitive asset. Think there's nothing more real
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:42.240]   time than the data coming into an F1 race car. Constant flow of data, real time. Tibco can set it
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.880]   up so that you can analyze that and use it and get those insights. Fuel the modern enterprise
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:51.040]   through Tibco's connected intelligence. You want to know more about Tibco and how they unlock the
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:47:01.920]   value of your company's real time data. Tibco.com/podcast. That's tibco.com/podcast. Really
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.800]   interesting company. I spent almost an hour talking to them about all the different things
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:12.560]   they are capable of doing. And I was blown away 14 leadership positions from top industry analysts,
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:17.760]   including Gartner. They are the kings of this. They are huge in the digital economy. You need
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:24.720]   them. Tibco.tibco.com/podcast. And we thank them so much for supporting this week in tech.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:30.720]   Sometimes I wish I had Tibco to help me understand what's going on in this world around us. It is
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:39.920]   a wild ride. All right, we're done with Congress. If only. I'm done with Congress.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:50.240]   Moving on to other shores. Let me see. There are so many things we could talk about today. It's
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:55.200]   really nice to have the three of you here. I don't want anybody to think that we said,
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:01.840]   "Oh, let's get all women on." But it happened. I think it's working out pretty well. Lori Gill
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:10.800]   from MacBreak Weekly. And of course, imore.com. Lisa Schmeisner from the IT Pro Today team. She's
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:17.920]   editor there. El Schmeisner on the Twitter and Lindsay Turrentine. Big shot. SVP and content
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:27.360]   and audience at CNN. Everybody is worried in the audience. When's Leo going to bring up the M1 chip?
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:39.840]   Hello. Hello, Craig. Hello, Craig. That's going to be an iconic shot, isn't it?
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:46.560]   Craig, Fred, are you? We're going to see memes of that so soon. Like legit memes. It's going to
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:51.440]   happen real real soon. Oh my god. Have you heard of that? You've got to have that photo.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:58.480]   The premise of that in the Apple video last week. It's like a pulp fiction still. It is, isn't it?
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.880]   It's just wild. Was the instant on on Mac laptops. The funny thing is,
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:09.120]   Mac laptops have always been instant on. I have never had a delay opening up the Mac laptop.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:13.440]   I don't know why they decided to pick that. There's so many other things you could talk.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.440]   But I did want to point out there have been a couple of really useful articles
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.120]   in the aftermath of this. What happens with any Apple event? At least it does for me.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:26.880]   Even without Steve Jobs, there is a reality distortion field. They're so good at marketing
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:32.320]   that you watch this and you start drooling and you say, "I got it and I got to have that. I want
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.880]   to have that." So it's really important to step back after that and say, "Okay, but really,
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:42.240]   what is it? What's the difference going to be?" And also, of course, for everybody,
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.520]   independent press to get end users to get their hands on these devices and see what they really
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.200]   are like in the real world. So a couple of things have been happening over the last two weeks.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:56.880]   First of all, people are getting their new MacBook Airs or MacBook Pros or new Mac Minis
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:03.760]   with the M1 chip. And there has been in general huge excitement. People are saying,
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:10.880]   "This thing is, these are fast. These are, this is battery life to die for. These are
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.680]   really nice machines." With none of the flaws people were worried about with the first generation
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.600]   product. And the next thing that's happening is I think some very good journalists have stepped up.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:26.640]   Ars Technica had a great piece with Craig Federighi, Johnny Sruggi, and who else? There was a third
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:34.160]   person in there talking about the process of design. And Om Malek, who I always, I miss Giga.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:41.440]   Om is now he's a VC, but he's still got that journalist hat on. He spent some time talking about
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:49.440]   the M1 chip and some really interesting conversations about what it means. And he said,
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:59.440]   and I think this is kind of true, that this is really what's from day one, Steve Jobs was aiming for.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:08.320]   He calls it Steve Jobs' last gambit. We're learning that Apple's been planning this for years,
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:15.200]   at least three years. It takes three years for them to conceive of a chip from then to shipping it.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:24.240]   And so they're aiming some degree into the future. I also think, and this is again taking off from
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:35.600]   Om, the M1 is a, I think, a phase change in desktop computing that something has happened
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:42.000]   that will change Intel, that will change AMD, that will change Windows forever.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:48.240]   One of the things he says chips have become so complex that you need integration and specialization
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.600]   to create better performance and control power consumption. That's one of the advantages Apple
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.880]   has. They do the software, they do the hardware, and they do all the hardware now.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:02.560]   He also says, and I thought this was interesting, when I saw the chip, a huge amount of it is devoted
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:07.520]   to machine learning. He said machine learning will define the capabilities of software in the future.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:13.600]   The unified memory architecture, which means RAM is much faster, perhaps more efficient.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:21.120]   You may not need as much RAM. Talk me off the ledge. Now I'm not going to ask Lori to do this,
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.040]   because we've been talking about this. Because I'm going to push you right now.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:28.320]   I know you're going to push me off. But Lindsey and Lisa, talk me off the ledge here.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:34.160]   Am I nuts to think that this is, I'll start with you, Lindsey, because you look at the industry
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:42.080]   as a whole. And then I'll go to Lisa, because she's a Windows person. Do you think this is
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:48.400]   that kind of a phase change, an inflection point in technology? Is that too much to say?
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:56.080]   I think it's going to take time, but it will be after a couple of years.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:03.760]   Just from a practical standpoint, anytime Apple changes something in a big way,
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.560]   it takes a few years to get enough adoption and enough apps out there in the ecosystem to take
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:16.640]   advantage of it. It just takes time. I think that enough creators have this hardware and will buy
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.960]   this hardware that it will create change necessarily. It always does.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:25.280]   And you make an excellent point. I'm getting mine tomorrow, but people have taken their home
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:29.680]   already are pointing out there's a lot of software that is not native.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:35.840]   Surprisingly large amount is, but still quite a bit of important programs aren't native.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.680]   And there's some stuff that doesn't work at all.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:43.840]   Well, the Adobe apps aren't already yet. There's a beta, a Photoshop that is,
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:48.320]   and they say Lightroom next month. Yeah, but illustrator, premiere,
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.280]   not there's a lot of stuff. There's a lot of stuff. They're not ready yet. They're not going to get
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.920]   what they need quite yet. So they're going to wait. I mean, so years and years ago, David
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:01.120]   Carnoy, who's a 10 year reviewer at CNET convinced me, and I've stuck with it,
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:07.680]   never ever buy a first gen Apple product. Yeah, that's the convention. Unless you want to
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:13.440]   be a tester. I've broken that rule a few times and regretted it.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:19.920]   Not because the products were bad, but because you realize that they were fine,
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.800]   but the next generation is going to be really darn good. There's actually no question about
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:32.080]   that. The M2, the M3, the M4, if this chip is this good, will be amazing.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.200]   So there would be good reason if you could wait to wait, I guess.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:40.320]   Yeah, although I am feeling, I will admit, I bought a MacBook right before this.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:46.560]   I told everybody that it was coming. I said, do not, do not buy an Intel device now.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.440]   That's a mistake. I said, I did. And it was a little bit of money saving all the skepticism,
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:56.240]   like, hey, well, I'm not going to buy the first generation anyway, and I need a new laptop.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:00.640]   And now I'm feeling kind of sad about it. So I'm contradicting myself.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:06.160]   The other thing that's important is that as much as Microsoft would love to do this,
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:14.160]   they can't design their own chips because they've got OEMs. They've got Lenovo and Dell and HP
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.680]   and everybody's making these. They can't do suddenly do what Apple's done and said, no,
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:23.440]   gosh, we're going to use Microsoft chips. No, they can't. They have Windows historically's
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.800]   biggest boat anchor has been legacy. They're not going to abandon legacy. Apple does, for some
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.880]   reason, they don't seem, I guess, because they have a tiny market share. They don't seem to mind
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:38.480]   cutting people off at the knees and saying, sorry, the future is now Microsoft never does that.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:44.720]   And yet I have to think if you're a Windows laptop user, you're looking over the fence at 22-hour
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:55.120]   battery life at better performance and saying, so tell me from on the other side of the fence,
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:59.280]   Lisa. How does it look over there? That was a good setup.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:12.160]   Unless you're on a computer for 22 hours straight, battery life is going to be a lot more personal.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:18.080]   I think the thing that made me sit up and pay attention was actually in TechCrunch,
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:22.640]   where the reviewer said, oh, this thing works like an iPad. Matthew Pansing.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.760]   Yeah. And then said, the click is responsive. Every interaction is immediate. It feels like
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:32.480]   an iOS device in the best way. And the reason I thought that was really important is because it
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:37.840]   points to a trend that we're actually seeing on the Windows side too, which is the notion that
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:45.120]   computing is not going to be based on the model that we're used to where the keyboard and the mouse
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:50.400]   are your primary sources of input and data manipulation and data access. We're moving to
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:56.480]   a model where it's going to be tactile and immediate and you and your data are going to flow between
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:03.040]   your mobile device and your laptop device and back and forth. And I thought it was interesting that
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:10.320]   Apple is massaging and amplifying user expectations for a shift that's already in progress and a shift
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:16.160]   that's already been happening with people who are hardcore service users for quite a while.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:21.360]   And there's also, it feels like to sub-degree Microsoft prepared for this
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:27.360]   in an interesting way because starting next year, they're going to be selling a product where
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:31.840]   you're not even running Windows locally. You're running in the cloud. Yeah. No desktop as a
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:37.440]   service is a huge and growing market for enterprise folks and it's gotten a real boost from
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:46.240]   well 2020 because when any enterprise is faced with having to support people virtually instead
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:50.480]   of being able to just like walk over and see why somebody is hitting the restart button repeatedly
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.760]   and not getting to ring it up. You know, DAAS, it's just you can pop in, see what they're doing,
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:02.320]   reconfigure things, reboot it for them, get it going. And Microsoft was,
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:08.400]   I guess the best way to put it is Microsoft is like, yes, this is going to be a thing.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:13.360]   Yes, we've already, they've already got a really strong cloud-based position and they've seen
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.320]   phenomenal growth in their cloud-based services for the enterprise like not just Azure. We're
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:24.400]   talking like Office 365 has been great for them too. And this is another logical outgrowth of that
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:30.480]   where if I get a customer to pay for a service rather than a life. Yeah, if I could play Cyberpunk
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:37.200]   2077 on an Android phone or a Chromebook on Google Stadia, why the hell do I need to have
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:42.960]   Windows running on a machine? Yeah, exactly. Which in some ways, it almost feels like Apple
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:48.560]   might have made a strategic mistake. They focused on making a more powerful desktop while Microsoft
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:56.560]   focused on running wherever you are, right? But are they really aiming at the same audience?
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:02.240]   For all that we're sitting here talking about this, a lot of Microsoft's bread and butter is in really
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:11.360]   almost boring for, we run the world type places like hospital offices or school administration
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:17.840]   things like that. And Apple's done a really good job of colonizing a much different set of offices
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:23.680]   and industry verticals. So I don't know if you can necessarily compare them one to one anymore.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.760]   They're very different companies in a lot of ways. Microsoft makes an increasing percentage of its
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:32.880]   revenue quarter over quarter based on cloud-based services and data manipulation. Whereas Apple
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:38.480]   is beginning to move into consumer-based services and emphasis on wearables and phones and things
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:44.960]   like that. So maybe it's not. You can't really do business parity in my opinion. They're both
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:52.560]   part of a personal computing ecosystem. But they have very different functions. It's the same thing.
[00:59:52.560 --> 01:00:01.760]   You can have your KitchenAid mixer and you can have your coffee maker and both of them can be
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:05.520]   beautifully designed and do what they're going to do. But you can't interchange them. You can't make
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:12.000]   coffee in a five-squared mixer. Nobody says, "Yeah, I wish I had a burr grinder in my kitchen aid."
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.920]   So maybe it's better to say instead of an inflection point where we're at a fork in the road,
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.160]   where computing is going to take two different directions. Is that a fair?
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:29.360]   Now, Mary mind, this is just a personal opinion. This is also based on watching trends in the
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.720]   enterprise and things like that. If you are an end user, you're probably going to conceive of
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.280]   computing as this is the collection of data and experiences in apps that are in my personal
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:44.640]   cloud and I access them through any one of a wide variety of hardware devices. For the companies,
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.560]   it's going to be a slightly different relationship where they're like, "These are going to be the
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:53.200]   services we offer and these devices and appliances we offer and these are the configurations we offer."
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.360]   You're not going to have people locked into different platforms. You're going to have them
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:03.200]   maybe locked into different services based on how easy it is to move their stuff around and access it.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:10.080]   But if somebody is an Apple partisan, it's not, "Oh, I only store things in iCloud. I never use
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.000]   Google Drive or Gmail. That's just not how it works." No, exactly.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.080]   And actually, Laurie, it may not be a bad thing if I have an Apple computer as a consumer for my
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:28.720]   stuff that I'm doing locally and that's my product. There's been a lot of questions, "Well,
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.760]   what about Bootcamp? Will I be able to run Windows on this?" In fact, in the Ars Technica article,
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.680]   I think Craig Fager has said, "That's up to Microsoft. They've got to figure that out. It's not our
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.280]   job to get Windows running on our new Macintashes." Maybe the answer is, "I don't run Windows on my
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:51.840]   Macintosh. I run Windows Virtual Desktop in a browser and now I have everything I want. I have a
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:59.120]   cloud. I have Windows. I have a personal device that is aesthetic and beautiful and powerful.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.160]   I get everything I want. Is that...? I haven't used a virtual machine yet. I'm testing out the
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.760]   MacBook Pro right now and one of the things I need to do is test out a virtual machine on it.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.640]   But from what I understand, the issues with other Macs having a little bit of lag using
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:18.080]   virtual machines goes away completely with the M1 chip. That's the pain point that people would
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:24.560]   say, "I use Bootcamp because I don't like the Mac operating system. I want the hardware that is
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:31.600]   the Mac, but I want the software that is Windows. Let's see. Maybe the virtual machine is the solution
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.480]   to that at least temporarily while Bootcamp is not working for the M1 chip."
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.720]   Lisa, does Windows Virtual Desktop run? It runs in a browser, right? Or do you have a client app?
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.480]   How does that work? You know? You asked me and I haven't actually had any hands-on time.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.640]   Well, nobody has. It comes out next year.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:58.480]   I mean, in theory, you could run it in a bright. Here's what I find really interesting.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:05.360]   While a number of manufacturers, including Microsoft, have been said, "Well, we're going to embrace the
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.800]   M1 chip, but we're not going to do it right away," or offices currently in beta. Google,
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:17.120]   within days, said, "Oh, here's Chrome." And I thought about it and I realized that's actually
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:24.080]   because I think Google sees Chrome as the window into Windows Virtual Desktop. I know they see Chrome
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.040]   as the window into Stadia. People complain, "Oh, my M1 is not going to play video games. I
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:36.080]   don't have a discrete GPU. Who cares? You're going to be running--" Sorry. I just-- When that hit me,
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:41.200]   I thought, "I don't have to worry about native games on my Mac, on my new Mac, because I'm going to run
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:47.840]   Chrome native and it's going to use Webism or whatever technologies, PWA technologies it uses
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:54.640]   to--" And I can play Fortnite. I could play I ordered Pre-ordered Cyberpunk 2077. I could play all of that
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:01.200]   because it's not running on the machine. It's running in the cloud. I'm streaming it to a browser.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.000]   I think that's-- To me, that's why I think this is a seed change. And I don't know what it's going
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.160]   to-- how it's going to shake out. But I think you-- I think you actually-- you nail it, Lisa,
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.280]   by saying, "Yours, there's a personal thing." Like, my wrist watch is a piece of jewelry,
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:27.200]   is a personal object, a commodity that's mine, my phone. But it's a window into a larger toolset
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:33.120]   that is actually probably in the cloud, much of it. And this is Microsoft's perfectly positioned for that.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:42.480]   All right, nothing to say. I'm going to take a break. I knew this wouldn't go anywhere. I just
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:48.080]   try. I try. That's all. I'm trying to bring up the M1-- you know, the chat room's going, "No!
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:54.480]   Don't let Leo talk about it anymore!" They're sick to death of it. They don't want to hear
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:01.280]   anymore about it. Let me talk about LastPass. Our sponsor, they sponsor the studio. This has been
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:07.040]   2020. It's been a tough year for everybody, including us. But I want to thank LastPass
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:12.240]   because thanks to you, LastPass, we've been able to keep the lights on and the shows rolling.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:19.520]   LastPass does more than that, LastPass protects our most vital assets, our data. You don't want to
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:25.280]   trust your bank accounts, your websites, your customer databases to just any company.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.440]   That's why LastPass has been our choice for identity and access management for years. I started
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:34.880]   using LastPass 12 years ago as my password manager. About six years ago, we started using LastPass
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:41.520]   Enterprise for Twit. And I'm not alone in loving LastPass in the G2FAL grid reports that's appeared
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:49.360]   at peer-to-peer review site. 746 customers left user reviews. 93% of them, four or five stars.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:55.040]   People love LastPass. You know who's going to also love LastPass? Your IT department and your
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:02.400]   security folks because it lets you take control back of your password security. You've got a central
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:07.920]   dashboard. You can see exactly what's going on in your business, company-wide visibility. It'll
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:12.560]   not just show you who's using what, when, and where, but it'll even show you how you're progressing.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.880]   For every employee, you can view their password scores. You can gain access to shared accounts,
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:22.160]   monitor group memberships, and more. You get visibility into what people are doing with those
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:28.880]   most vital resources. You get complete control of privileges. You can customize admin privileges.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:33.200]   For instance, we have a business department that uses LastPass to access the bank accounts,
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.520]   things like that, QuickBooks. We can have an administrator there that can access all of that,
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:44.560]   but can't get into our operations department because you've got to kind of partition everything out.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.520]   No matter what your organization's source of truth, LastPass will integrate to onboard users,
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.960]   to sync groups to revoke access when it's time to do that. You get complete audit reports that
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:01.760]   help you build compliance and maintain accountability, detailed reporting logs that tie actions to
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.400]   individuals because that's really what you need. You need to see what your users, especially when
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.320]   your employees are working from home. What are they doing? What are they accessing?
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.960]   And making sure with multi-factor authentication that only the right people are accessing those
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:21.360]   resources. MFA goes beyond simple two-step. You've got, of course, the biometrics that the
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.200]   fingerprint or the face recognition or the iris recognition, but in addition to that,
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:31.520]   you have contextual multi-factor things like geolocation and IP address. Your company can
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:38.000]   enable and require MFA. We do. You get 100 plus policies. We make sure that everybody uses two
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.440]   factor. We make sure there's a minimum password requirements, lots of advanced security features,
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:49.120]   or if you want to make it simple, out of the box, LastPass is configured for a perfect balance
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:55.040]   between convenience and security. The point is you get control. You can do whatever you need to do
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.000]   to make LastPass work for you. And of course, when you're creating LastPass passwords,
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.120]   that password generator does long, strong, randomized passwords, keeps track of them for you,
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:13.680]   and 1200 plus single sign-on apps. Eight awards so far for LastPass this year,
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.320]   PC Magazine's editor's choice, Fortress Cybersecurity Award, business insiders,
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.320]   best overall password manager. That's just a few. I love LastPass. I use it. I'm dedicated,
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.760]   devoted to it. And so is our company. I think you'll feel the same way. Take control of your
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:36.480]   password security. Go to LastPass.com/twit. LastPass.com/twit. Now more than ever,
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:42.880]   with employees working from home, people all over the place, you need to take control of your
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:51.600]   identity and access management. Do it with LastPass. Speaking of encryption, Google is now rolling
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:59.440]   out end-to-end encryption default in RCS. I don't know if, are you guys up on RCS if you want to talk
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:06.320]   about this is kind of an inside baseball thing. I don't know much about the details about it, but
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:16.080]   kind of a little bit understand generally the overarching idea behind it, which is that we're
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.800]   talking about AMP, right? We're talking about the Google. No, no, no, no, RCS is rich communication
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.080]   services. Basically, we're talking about Google's response to Apple's messages.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.920]   So, Apple has never, of course, put messages anywhere but on Apple devices. But people lot the
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:42.880]   features that Apple's messages offer. Google was hoping that they could get the mobile carriers
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:51.520]   to do this. Mobile carriers like SMS, nobody else does. And the carriers really dragged their
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:57.520]   feet. So, last year, Google finally threw up their hands and said, "Fine." We'll do it.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:05.040]   They actually bought a company that did RCS. And as of this week, Google completed a rollout of
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:11.040]   RCS for all Android phones using Android Messenger, where I guess they call it Google
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.680]   messages. I don't know. You never know with Google what the hell their messaging platform is, but
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:22.640]   I guess it's now Google messages. It has RCS and they are starting to put an end-to-end encryption
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   as well. And the problem is on Apple, you're still a green bubble. It doesn't matter what you do.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.680]   If you're on Android, you're a damn green bubble and you're discriminated again.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:42.720]   And Apple's not going to ever put Apple's messages on Android. And it's a shame because
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.720]   it feels like it's siloed in both cases, mostly because of it.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.560]   It is. And it has become, you're right, is 100% become a social thing.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.440]   And I, without naming the teenager in question,
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.680]   is it one you own or one you rent?
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:10.320]   It's what I own. And this one changed his entire platform because of not wanting to be a green
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.760]   bubble. I'm literally getting left out of conversations with my friends.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:19.920]   Yeah, especially group conversations. So Google has its own group chat, but if you're on an
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.360]   Android device and your friends are on messages from Apple, you're just kind of your left. They
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.880]   don't even say, "Don't let him in the group. It's just going to mess it up."
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.720]   My brother's on an Android device. My mom is on an Apple device.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:39.920]   He's a little salty about the fact that you're not talking to me.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:47.520]   Well, I'd love to have him on a platform where I could loop him right in and message it to.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:54.320]   I don't think it's just Android users who are out in the cold on this. It's, frankly,
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:00.880]   a little bit silly that my ability to create group chats and give them funky names and drop
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:07.600]   and drag stuff and ping people on either my desktop or my iPad or my phone. I don't like that.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:14.320]   It leaves out a lot of people that I know. But if it is driving purchases, which it is clearly
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:21.280]   since I've been driving purchases. No, inside. Oh, that's horrible.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.000]   Oh, that's horrible. These poor Android people are going to be all off.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.280]   Is the solution telling all your friends, does this work? I don't know, to use Facebook Messenger
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:37.360]   or WhatsApp or how to? No, I don't know. I mean, it has become because it has become
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:43.840]   a strange status and social thing. I always go to the young people. I sound so old.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:51.200]   No, no, you're not. First of all, you're sitting next to an old man. So you'll always look young.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:57.200]   But also, this is the way it is. It's young people are the ones who are kind of solving this
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.680]   unilaterally, forcing us older people to go along for the ride.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:07.360]   You know what? They're actually all... They're just going to Discord.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:11.440]   Oh, interesting. I mean, in reality, that's... Maybe that's the future.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:17.200]   It's not going to be Android or iOS or one messaging platform. Another that fixes this,
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.720]   it's going to be a complete third party. And that's how they talk to each other.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.280]   You know what's good about that? They're on Discord servers and they...
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.720]   Mom's not on Discord.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.000]   Actually, okay. Some family in my little body story.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.560]   I am on Discord and the reason I'm on Discord is because I couldn't get my kids to text me back.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:39.840]   I joined Discord and my username is your mom and I befriended one of my children.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:44.880]   And he came back to me and was like, "LOL, ha, ha, ha." And I'm like, "No, really, I'm your mom."
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.960]   I thought you were just somebody like a friend of mine trolling me. And then both of my kids
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.160]   have been like, "This is great. It's so easy to get in touch with you."
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:54.560]   Oh!
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.400]   Well, I don't care what the platform is. Can we just all agree? I did fine with me.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.760]   Let's go Discord, everybody.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.080]   Discord is it. That's where the kids are.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:09.120]   Yeah. And just like you're saying, Lindsey, on the one hand, there is this sort of like status
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:17.040]   pressure, the green bubble, blue bubble situation. But the kids aren't going to go where they're
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:22.080]   going to go. And it doesn't matter whether Android has a messages app. It doesn't matter whether
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.720]   Apple has a messages app. It's really, they're going to find their own ways to have group
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.960]   conversations and chats and things like that. And it's going to change. Right now, it's Discord.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.720]   It'll be something else in a year or two.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.040]   That's the problem with the Utes.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:35.760]   Is they just...
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.600]   They're pickled.
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.160]   They're pickled.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:43.520]   Well, I feel like you can watch the Utes, as it were, to see where they're going
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:48.080]   with communications, preferences, and technologies, and how that's going to shape things in the
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.960]   workplace down the line. And the fact that they're so into Discord now, like,
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.480]   wait until Discord hits the enterprise in about five to six years.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:56.960]   Right.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.280]   Well, the funny thing is that my kids, one of my kids actually wrote a letter to the
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:07.040]   principal of his high school to try to convince the high school to use Discord instead of Zoom
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.000]   for virtual teaching.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.160]   Oh, I guess you could, right? You could.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.560]   Can you do Discord everything you do in Zoom or Teams or Skype?
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.680]   It's very much like Slack.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.120]   It's like Slack, but with more voice emphasis.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.520]   I'm not completely ignorant.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:22.480]   I have a Discord account.
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.320]   I created one so that I could play on the Vatican's Minecraft server.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.840]   This may explain why this is like Slack is boosting its ability to leave like little
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:37.440]   audio snippets and things like that there too, as they recognize for that audience is coming from.
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.760]   So, tell me now, if I use Discord,
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.360]   could I...
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.000]   See, this is Apple again.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.080]   They don't let you say, "I don't want to use messages as my default."
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.280]   They don't, you can't change that.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:51.920]   No, yeah.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.400]   That's never going to change.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.080]   Apple's not going to let that happen.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:02.640]   That's too bad because that means I'm kind of stuck still on an iPhone using messages
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:05.600]   until somebody does a gateway or something.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.720]   Maybe there's messages to Discord gateway.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:14.960]   Isn't this a little bit of the risk Apple faces by not opening up messages that somebody's
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.120]   going to come along and be cross-platform and just take the market away from them?
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:19.760]   Is that a...
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:26.080]   So, I think the problem is, from my perspective, and maybe this isn't the way everybody uses
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:34.640]   their devices, but the messages app on iPhone is the default messages app and that's why I use it.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.000]   It has nothing to do with where my friends are, what platforms they use.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.080]   It's the text messaging thing for the phones.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:48.880]   I'm old enough that there was just text messaging back then and so that's my default where I go.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.640]   So, I have a number of different ways that I chat with people with Slack and Discord and all
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:17:01.600]   these other things, but if I want to talk to a person, I just go to the thing where I text message
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.960]   people which on the phone is the messages app.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.680]   I don't think it's a competition type thing.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:12.000]   If I was on an Android phone, that is the thing that I would use to text message people.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.200]   That's just how I think of it.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.520]   And I really do...
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.720]   Again, I'm going back to that.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.240]   It's really a status thing when you can say, "I've got the blue bubble."
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:25.600]   I don't think it's that the messages app is so great and doesn't everybody wish they had
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.960]   something similar?
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.480]   No, everybody just wants a blue bubble.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.200]   That's all it is.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:35.840]   Is there any chance Apple will adopt RCS?
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.200]   No.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.240]   They don't need RCS.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.160]   They have all the features of RCS in their siloed app.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.400]   It's market pressures.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.560]   What can convince...
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:47.520]   Say, this is a mess.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.240]   That's the problem.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:55.360]   It's too fragmented a market for any one thing even in Google's RCS to threaten Apple's messages.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.760]   So, they could just sit back and say, "Yeah, fine.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.320]   Have fun."
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:05.520]   But you know what they should do and they might do because the user experience is important to Apple
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:12.320]   and what they should do and hopefully would do is make the kind of features that interact with
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.040]   Android devices, for example, a lot easier.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:24.560]   So, renaming a group message or tap-backs that make sense to an Android user or being able to
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:29.120]   pin the group message that has an Android user.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:35.680]   Like, if Apple could on the iPhones end make the interaction with Android users a better
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:41.040]   experience for the iPhone user, they don't need to worry about what the Android user thinks,
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.880]   but they need to worry about what I think.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:47.920]   And if it's frustrating to me that I can't have the same kind of experience with my friends who use
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.600]   Android, I'm mad at Apple.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.120]   I'm not mad at Android.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.080]   So, I think it's a good question for them to make some changes.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:19:00.960]   Is Apple doing this to make it for ecosystem lock-in? Is it just any competitive that they're saying,
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.000]   "Nope, I'm not going to do it."
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.480]   You can't change your default messenger.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.560]   We're not going to incorporate these features.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.960]   Our way or the highway?
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:16.880]   I don't think that is in this case and it's because you can use any other messaging app that
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.200]   you want so they don't lock you in to messages.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.000]   You can at any point in time open up the Discord app and use that.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.640]   You can hide the messages app and put Discord right there on your main page and make that be the
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.240]   thing that you always open.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:41.200]   You can make it your default messaging app by just not using the other service.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:48.000]   So, I don't think it's really a lock-in sort of anti-competitive situation for this particular thing.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:55.440]   I think it's really just an issue of it's been such a nice pleasurable experience for iPhone users
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.720]   for so long that it's kind of a joke now.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:04.160]   People want to make fun of Android's lack of that kind of feature.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:10.720]   And then again, like I was saying, there's the user experience from the perspective of an iPhone
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:14.720]   user, but it's really not that big of a deal.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.800]   Are you all iPhone users? Anybody use Android?
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:25.680]   Nope, all iPhone users. See, I think whether Apple's doing it intentionally or not, it does have that
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:31.040]   impact because I don't, I, you know, I fell in love with Telegram. I wanted everybody to use
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:36.240]   Telegram. I've gone through all these stages. AOL, instant messenger. Anybody remember that?
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:45.040]   Eventually, I just gave in. I just sank into the warm bath that is the Apple ecosystem.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.760]   Right? But didn't we all do that?
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.440]   Yeah. It's like, uh, just use messages.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:58.400]   Yes, we did. And that's why I do maintain that it may not be anti-competitive because there are
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:05.520]   our alternatives, but it's definitely a market share move.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:11.520]   Yeah. I think people do like your, was it you were saying that one of you, or maybe it was
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:16.080]   what my kid said, just said, we don't, you know, get a, get a, get a real phone.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:22.240]   Well, my son was. I'm trying to tell my brother that too, so that it could go to a real phone.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:25.680]   Yeah. Just telling you want to be in the family. What do you hate us?
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.800]   But you can, but you can be in the family chat. It's just from your perspective on your phone,
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:36.880]   you can't rename the conversation and all the fun things. So it's really, it's you, not your
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.080]   brother, right? Like your brother's like, what? I'm just just telling me.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:46.000]   They make your choices exclusionary. I mean, what was actually happening with these teenagers was
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.400]   that they were leaving people out of the chat because they were green bubbles. We don't want you.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.040]   And they wanted to keep the group all blue because the functionality was different and
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:58.800]   annoyed them. That's right. They just ditched the blue or green. Do you lose some things with
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.960]   green bubbles in there? It's not like you do. I mean, the thing is, is, is I chat with my mom,
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.640]   she'll ping me when I'm at work in the middle of the day. And it's easier for me to
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:12.720]   just, I'm on my laptop. I can look something up, drop it back into her chat, and it's done. And
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:18.240]   that's so easy. I love that I can just move between things that have keyboards and things that
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.520]   are mobile devices. Whereas if it's the family chat with my brother, I can only access that on the phone.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:33.600]   But you can turn on continuity and use your computer as a phone and receive those text messages.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:40.080]   Another reason why you should probably be running a Macintosh computer as well as an iPhone.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:47.600]   You see? See how that happens? Just relax in the nice, warm bath of apple.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:55.760]   You know, put some bubbles in there. Enjoy. Light some candles. No blue bubbles. No green bubbles,
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:04.000]   only blue bubbles. I really do think it's something that Apple should work to make a better
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.600]   for me, the apple buyer and all the people like me. It not don't bring it to Android. Just make the
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:16.320]   iPhone a better user experience for people who have to have conversations with Android users
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:21.280]   so that it's not an issue anymore. Do you think there's much pressure from apples users to do that?
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.920]   I don't care. Just get rid of the green bubbles. You're just not in my life.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:30.640]   But I do think you're not mean, but it's true.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:37.760]   I do think that there is the reason that apple needs to make it a better experience is because
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:43.280]   back to that earlier conversation, people are just going to leave texting altogether.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:50.240]   It's going to become, and I sort of noticed this happening already. That's just not where a lot
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.520]   of the back and forth that I used to have with some people now happens in other apps.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.880]   Because it's more cumbersome to do it via text for whatever reason. And when you're talking about
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.480]   these microscopic choices that really is deciding between something that's going to take you five
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:10.480]   milliseconds and something that's going to take you seven milliseconds, it seems kind of like a silly
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:16.240]   decision. But these things happen over time. And you move toward the system that is more frictionless.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:24.400]   And if people stop texting, it won't really matter to Apple and it'll hurt them in the long run. So
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:31.680]   anyway, they should work on making it better. So there will be a business consequence to Apple if
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:37.440]   they don't realize this at some point. I think so. People won't care about the blue bubbles because
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.680]   they won't be using any bubbles. You know, the only, it seemed like the only company that could at
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.640]   this point be competitive was Zoom. Consumed to all of that. They don't have a messaging
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:52.560]   capability, really. They need to work on that. Or is that where maybe that's where
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:25:03.120]   Slack and Skype and Teams went wrong is by putting too much stuff in. No, nobody else is competing.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:10.320]   Well, I think back to its discord and Slack for a lot of people. Yeah, like a lot of people who
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:15.920]   used to text me for work reasons now use Slack. So tell me on the tell me on Discord, you have
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.200]   to create a family group though, right? Discord is all group related. So you it's very much like
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:27.200]   Slack. You can create a discord server. So the kids, they're all into creating servers. They learn
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:32.560]   that from Minecraft. So they create discord servers, but you can do group chats. You can have
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.320]   one-on-one conversations and a lot of it. And then you can switch seamlessly to voice, which is
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.920]   why a lot of them use it. It started as a gaming platform. Yeah, I know I remember.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:47.280]   Yeah. To have voice conversation. It feels like it feels so, it feels like, so email was
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:52.080]   originally like this. Nobody remembers this. But you know, if you had MCI mail, you couldn't email
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.280]   somebody with Jeannie or CompuServe. It just didn't go. And eventually we said, that's stupid. We
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.200]   should federate and everybody should be able to email everybody. We solved it and went away.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:07.920]   But then there was, then the message wars began. And for a little while we had,
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:13.520]   I mean AOL's instant messenger was, no, ICQ was the first, then there was AM.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:20.640]   And for a while there were programs that would let you do all of them, like Pigeon and stuff.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:26.480]   And then they changed the protocols because they didn't want that. And as a result, that was a
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:32.320]   mistake. They faded away, whatever happened to ICQ, a name. They shut the servers down,
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.800]   they're over. But we're still in that same tower of Babel that we were in 20 years ago,
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:41.920]   where all these, we have all these messenger platforms, the names have changed. But it's the
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.400]   same experience from the point of view of the user. You have to figure out, well, what platform is
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:54.480]   dad on and how can I message Joey? I wish we, remember Trillian? I wish we had, what do we,
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.200]   how do we solve this? It's not a good solution.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:04.240]   Trillian was too early. I think it is being solved in a similar way now just at a time when
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:09.600]   people are ready for it because their connections are faster and they're more used to, and it
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.400]   app infrastructure is just easier now.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.960]   Doesn't Discord also have kind of a bad boy feel to it?
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:23.840]   I don't, you know, I don't, look, I will be really transparent here. Everything I know about
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:28.160]   it comes from just a couple of very small conversations that I have on it, and I'm not deep in it.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.520]   But there's-
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:31.040]   I feel like it's where hackers hang out.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:40.400]   A lot, it is really well moderated is my perception that people take their Discord server moderation
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:46.480]   very seriously, and it's in Discord's best interest to prevent nefarious stuff from happening because
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:51.440]   so many kids are on it. The second some legislature finds out that bad crap is happening on Discord,
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:57.920]   it'll be bad. So they, I get the impression that it's actually pretty well regulated internally.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.000]   All right, take a little break. I want to take you back in time when we come back.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:10.640]   As flash, there's actually two big deals going on. Flash has gone by the wayside.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:13.760]   This is it for flash one more month. Thank God.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:20.640]   And it is the 35th anniversary of a technology that changed the world. We'll talk about that in
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:26.400]   just a little bit. Our show today brought to you quite literally by our content delivery network
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:32.320]   CashFly. CashFly has been around since 1999. We've been using them since we practically the
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:37.440]   very beginning. In the earliest days of the podcast, I was letting people download it from a website
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:42.640]   that I didn't work out so well, then I tried BitTorrent. I remember the days when I come,
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.320]   the show would be over and said, "Okay, please see us so everybody can download it."
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.680]   It was a pain. Finally, Matt Levine of CashFly, one of the founders came along and said,
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:29:01.040]   "Leo, try CashFly." And it has been such a burden off my shoulders. CashFly brings our content
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:07.600]   closer to the users. So when you download the show, it's faster. It's instantaneous.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:13.520]   Because there's so many servers all over the world, you never have to worry about
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:20.720]   the servers down. People can't get the show. There's 100% SLA guarantee from CashFly. That's awesome.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:28.400]   I never get the 3M call. The server is down. I have to log in and make sure I haven't exceeded
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:34.400]   my capacity, that kind of thing. I just love it. But there is one little thing that any CDN has
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:39.440]   to deal with. It's a caching server. So when you put up a new show, the first thing that has to
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:45.600]   happen is the various servers all over the world, when somebody hits it and says, "I want the latest
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:50.000]   edition of Twit," that server says, "I don't have it," and has to go back to the source and get it.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.960]   And that could be a real problem for you downloading from the origin. That's what we call a Cash
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:59.840]   Miss. When there's a Cash Miss, they have to go to Amazon's S3 or wherever you store your
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:05.120]   content downloaded. That slows it down for your users. It could cause buffering if you're streaming.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:10.960]   It could be a real problem. It also costs you a lot of money because sometimes the real expense
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:18.880]   is the Cash Miss, where you've got data transfer out fields from S3 or whatever to get to your
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.440]   caching server. That's why we've been actually using this since almost since day one, but now
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:30.320]   Cash Fly is offering this to everybody. Storage Optimization System or SOS. It's a dedicated storage
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:37.120]   space on Cash Fly. So when we upload our podcast, we don't upload it to S3. We upload it to Cash Fly,
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:43.760]   which means your data and content is closer to your customers or your consumers. You save thousands
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:49.360]   a month by shielding your origin. Cash Fly guarantees no Cash Misses. What does that mean? No buffering,
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:53.760]   no slowdowns. Your download speeds will be drastically improved and your data transfer
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:31:00.560]   out fees will be significantly reduced and you'll get 100% Cash Hit Ratio. It is so awesome.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:06.000]   You're going to love SOS. There's just one more reason to use Cash Fly. They've also, by the way,
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.320]   increased their pops. They just got six new points of presence in South America,
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:15.200]   which means they're now serving 10 times the amount of traffic in Latin America since last year.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:22.000]   But not only is it not getting slower, they've actually drastically improved their performance in
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.800]   the region while they're taking on a much higher traffic load. We love it. We have listeners all
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:32.480]   over the world and Cash Fly serves them with servers near them. Whether your end users are in
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:38.880]   North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, your content is
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:45.600]   delivered quickly and reliably. You can expect consistency and performance everywhere in the world.
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:51.840]   Because of Cash Fly's reliable throughput and scalability, they're as fast as 500% faster than
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:59.440]   other CDNs. So get SOS, get that 100% uptime SLA guaranteed, industry-leading global performance,
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:06.880]   stream, podcast videos, digital downloads to global audiences of any size. It's the best thing
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:13.440]   that ever happened to us. It should happen to you too. And because of SOS, Cash misses delivered five
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:19.440]   times faster because you're getting it from the Cash Fly network instead of some third party across
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:24.480]   the public internet. Cash Fly, I want to congratulate them to their partnering with World Central Kitchen
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:31.440]   to help people in need. They've donated over $50,000, serving over 300,000 warm meals to people who are
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:37.760]   struggling in these difficult times. Great company, great people doing just what you need. Look at all
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:43.360]   the people who use Cash Fly, including us. Right now, if you want to know if Cash Fly can save you,
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:48.240]   just for Twit listeners, Cash Fly is giving away a complimentary detailed analysis of your current

[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:17.840]   Thank you, Cash Fly, for your support. Nobody's going to mourn flash. Right?
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:24.960]   Thank you, Steve Jobs, because it really was Steve who wrote the letter, public letter on the
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:30.160]   front page of Apple.com saying, "We're not going to put flash on our iPhone." And then later the
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:38.720]   iPad, it's over. Get over it. It took more than 10 years to die. But at the end of the year,
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:46.720]   even Adobe finally says, "It's over for flash." Well, the Internet Archive is making sure it's not
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:54.880]   over for flash. Good for the Internet Archive. Good for them. They have decided
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:03.040]   that now the beauty of this is you don't need flash to see flash on the Internet Archive.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:13.200]   They're using Webism and a flash emulator called Ruffle so that you can see flash items.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:20.960]   Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourself because it's peanut butter jelly time.
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:27.920]   Let's just go back in time from the year 2000. There it is.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:42.800]   Oh, remember that little pixelated banana? Oh man, you got to go to the Internet Archive's
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:51.920]   flash archive because there's so many things that will make you happy. Remember this?
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:58.720]   What was wrong with us in those days? We were younger? I don't...
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:05.280]   It's not that different now. I mean, now it's just this just happens in games.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:11.600]   Yeah, you're right. But I don't know. Maybe I'm getting old, but I feel like the memes aren't as
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.320]   good as they use. Oh, which one do you want to see? Oh my gosh.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.200]   This one.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:41.680]   That's the name they never ended. Right? They're never ending me. Which one do you want?
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:46.160]   Radis skull? Oh, I don't know if I'm ready for Radis skull. This is the...
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.800]   The whole theme song and everything. It was unbelievable.
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:56.480]   Radis skull and devil doll. So thank you in an Internet Archive for keeping this stuff around.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:04.080]   And you know what Ruffle does a really good job of just taking the SWF file and playing it smoothly,
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:13.840]   fluidly in your browser. No need. Here's... Remember Fly Guy? No need to install Flash in your browser.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.000]   This one doesn't have any audio, I don't think, but this was a fun little...
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:26.000]   This probably was the beginning of the dinosaur animation, right? On Google when you get a
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:36.320]   new fly guy and I can use the arrows to start flying. Life was simpler in those days.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:43.120]   It's so restful. It's so restful. Remember this one. You remember this? I do not. I don't remember it.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:49.360]   This... I don't... Yeah, I mean there's not much to it. That's it right there. You have a fly guy.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:59.040]   2002, 18 years ago. All right, thank you. I just had to do that. I had to punish you with that.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:06.720]   Oh, and there's one other thing. It was on November 20th... I bet you Lisa will know this one.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:17.760]   November 20th, 35 years ago, 1985. What happened that changed the world forever?
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:22.800]   It was the release of Windows 1.0.
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:34.320]   Which was by the way barely Windows. It was really a shell on top of DOS for many years.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:48.320]   Version 1, November 20th, 1985. Wow. Yeah, and that gave rise to a few articles. Here's one.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:53.440]   Happy birthday to Windows showing up. That was it. Maybe that's not it.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.720]   Few articles showing the old user interface. Boy, it was ugly.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:04.640]   It was really bad. Did you celebrate it Windows IT Pro? Did you even know that that
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:10.320]   anniversary happened? I don't think we did possibly because... You got to listen to
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:14.720]   Twitch because that's where all the stuff is happening. Yeah, now I think one of the reasons we
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:21.680]   didn't also is for the last few years, one of the stories that we've been following is Microsoft's
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:25.920]   persistent downplaying of Windows as a flagship sort of product. That's absolutely true.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.960]   Because they've really been shifting a lot of... I mean, it's not in a doll. It's been so consistent
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:37.040]   about the messaging where Microsoft is a data led company. It's all about data analysis and
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:43.600]   empowering users to be more productive. It's been really notable that in most of the keynote
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:48.880]   speeches, he's given at marquee events, even during the virtual events we've had this year,
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:53.760]   Windows doesn't really come up as one of the elements that Microsoft sees. I mean, it's
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.000]   a product they have. They're clearly not going to abandon it, but it's not the product that
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.520]   they're sticking their feature on. So I don't think they're going to do a whole lot of... And
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:05.120]   then we roll this out. Yeah, maybe they don't want to talk about it. Yeah.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:12.080]   In fact, it was under Satya Nadella that Microsoft's mission statement changed from
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.920]   well, first it was Windows in every computer, right? Or a computer in every house? A Windows
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.960]   computer on every desktop. Yeah, running Microsoft Windows. And then under Nadella,
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:27.280]   it was we want to be... He said many times we want to be wherever our customers are,
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:31.760]   but the best experience will be on Windows. And then they dropped that second part.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:40.400]   In 2015 at Ignite, they rolled out a mobile-first cloud-first computing experience that was the
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:46.160]   positioning they used. And they reiterated the message, a mobile-first cloud-first computing
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:52.800]   experience, which I thought was kind of a big deal, because what it effectively says is that
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:59.760]   your choice of device or your choice of operating system matters a lot less than the portability
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:07.440]   of computing period. And for the last few years, they've talked about how Microsoft's mission
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:14.160]   statement now is to empower every user on the planet through technology. So they're really
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.920]   like going big and big at this point. That's so vague and sounds like every mission statement
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:23.200]   ever written for anything. Yeah, mission statements are terrible, aren't they?
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:27.520]   I'm not being entirely fair to it because I can't recite all of it because I believe it's
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:32.000]   you're empowering every user. It has something to do with the quality of access at some point.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.560]   And there's something in there about using data as part of the empowering, but I agree with you.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:43.200]   It's a very pie in the sky. In theory, the skies will be clean and the temperatures will drop,
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:46.400]   and we'll have a quality of opportunity if we can all just get them to Azure.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.240]   And you're like, "Yeah, really?" It's clearly such in Adele as one of the best CEOs ever.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.600]   He transformed Microsoft, revitalized the stock price, revitalized the company,
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:04.160]   turned it around on a dime. But every time he talks, I glaze over. It's impossible. He's not good
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:08.480]   at concrete. Have you read Hit Refresh, which is the book that you wrote? No, I should.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:16.160]   I urge you to read that because if you don't like his speaking style, you might find the book
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:23.120]   more accessible. And what he does is he lays out a lot of the turnaround story for the company
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:32.400]   and how that's affect. And you also kind of, I feel like you also get a really strong sense of
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:37.120]   where the company is going to be piloting itself over the next five to ten years as well.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:40.960]   Well, maybe he should get whoever wrote that book to write his speeches because it's not...
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:44.880]   I have a question for you.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.480]   Before you do that, here's what a CEO at Microsoft really ought to be like.
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:42:00.240]   How much do you think that the best operating environment is worth? Wait, just one minute before
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:03.120]   you answer. Watch. The Windows. Oh, Steve.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:09.600]   It's my early vice. Now, it was this Ferrari and pasted it right into Windows right. Now,
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:14.400]   how much do you think Microsoft Windows is worth? Don't answer. Wait, you can see Windows right,
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.200]   Windows paint and then listen to what else you get at no extra charge. DMS talks exactly.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:23.280]   They have an appointment calendar, a card file, a note pad, a clock, a control panel,
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:29.680]   a terminal, a fifth-floor ram driver, and can you believe it? Reversing. That's why all these
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:39.840]   features in reverse, they all for just how much did you guess? 500? 1000? Oh my gosh, no, it's just
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:48.400]   $99. That's right. $99 is an incredible value, but it's true. It's Windows from Microsoft order
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:57.520]   today, PO Box 286, POS, except in Nebraska. I don't know how they got Palmer to do that.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:05.200]   I don't think he was a CEO at the time. Bill was still a CEO. He was just never had his sales
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:10.800]   or whatever it was. But I've always admired that kind of big sales energy. Yeah. I'm sure that was
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:17.760]   an internal. Yeah, that was a video intended for internal use only probably at a sales meeting
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:22.960]   where they were laughing and laughing, but it lives on on YouTube. Thank you. Oh my gosh,
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:27.120]   the internet never forget telling us about that. I'm sorry, Lori. What did you want? What did you
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:32.880]   want to say? I apologize. I was thinking like just from the perspective of a person who follows the
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:40.800]   Apple ecosystem, there are there are times in fact up until three weeks ago that a lot of people who
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:46.000]   were following Apple were saying that they're kind of forgetting about the Mac and they're
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.560]   forgetting about their they've moved on and the Mac is no longer important to them. And then now
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:55.760]   suddenly, oh, absolutely, that's not the case. Do you think Microsoft is going to just sort of
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:59.520]   forget about Windows? Do you think that we're going to see a future where there's
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:05.200]   not really much about Windows at all anymore and they're really just going to be taking care of
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:10.080]   legacy Windows, but it's not we're not going to see the next Windows iteration or something like that.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:15.200]   All right. That's a great question. And you can tell it's a great question because I'm saying
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.800]   the stalling thing. That's a great question to try to organize my thoughts. I answer it.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.920]   So to begin to answer it, I'm going to backpack just backpack, backtrack just a little to
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:34.880]   beginning premises or to beginning facts that I'm going to build the rest of my answer on.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:40.800]   And the first is that Windows still makes Microsoft a serious amount of money every quarter. Like they
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:47.360]   have three different business divisions. Windows is in one, Azure is in one and productivity,
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:53.680]   which is where they have Office 365 is in the third and their Windows and hardware division still
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:45:01.360]   it's only been very recently that Azure has overtaken that division in terms of reliably
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:04.720]   producing revenue every quarter. So Windows still makes them money. That's number one.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:13.040]   Number two is that when they rolled out Windows 10, they also rolled out the concept of continuous
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:19.840]   updates and began to promote the idea of Windows as a service, which is kind of a logical predecessor
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:28.400]   to desktop as a service. So I, oh, and the third thing I should add now that I'm thinking about it
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:38.640]   is over the course of the last, I want to say two years or so, we have seen them doing two things
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:44.960]   with end user software one. They're making it really easy to complete software functions
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:52.160]   across different applications. So if you are in Teams and someone says, hey, can you check out
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:56.960]   this spreadsheet, you can launch a specific file within Teams and edit it within Teams. You don't
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:02.480]   have to switch over to Excel, open it, edit it there and then reupload it to Teams again.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:10.160]   The goal that they're moving towards is they want to break down the siloed functions of apps and
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:15.120]   just rather have people think in terms of task flow. And number two, they want people to think
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:21.120]   of Teams as the primary space from which they work. So if you take a look at all three of those
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:28.160]   things, I think Windows is going to be a product that they keep up as long as they do have a legacy
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:34.720]   base that can't afford to pull in new computers and push everybody to a Cloud first thing. But
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.200]   I think at this point, it's a product they maintain because it makes them money and because they have
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:43.680]   a user base and as people move off of it, they're not going to go out of their way to continually
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:47.920]   reinvent a desktop experience anymore. I think they're going to move you more towards the idea
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:54.880]   of a collaborative workspace where you can move things in and out of Teams and/or one drive or
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:59.920]   share point and you can open stuff up like in Windows and not Windows, excuse me, you can open
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:06.320]   things up like in Word or you can answer emails even from Teams. But they're shifting the definition
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:10.400]   of how they see you working on a computer. As long as computing has been around, this has been
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:16.480]   like the Holy Grail. I remember Microsoft talking about this with the document, with Calm,
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:23.600]   Object Desktop. I remember Apple, well, Microsoft was going to create what was that long horn, which
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:30.720]   was a document-based way of thinking of things. Apple was doing the same thing with IBM. It was
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:36.240]   called Pink. As long as computing has been around, people have said, "No, no, no, no. We went on
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:42.240]   completely the wrong way. All users care about is their data and manipulating it." That's all
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:50.080]   that really any computing interaction is. We just focused on the operating system. That's
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:55.840]   infrastructure. Who cares about that? That's like saying, "I want to go to the bathroom,
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:02.480]   but first I got to install plumbing." It's not what users want to do. That's why I think in the
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:08.000]   long run, the future clearly for Microsoft and maybe for all computing is cloud-based.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.760]   I think if you're a small business or a big business, it's very attractive to say,
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.680]   "Well, just buy thin clients. You don't need to buy these big computers. You no longer have to
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:20.960]   worry about updates. You no longer have to worry about plumbing. You no longer have to worry about
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:27.280]   security. You just have a productivity tool. By the way, it's the same whether you're sitting at your
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:32.880]   desk at home or your desk at work or in your car on your phone. It's the same data. That's where
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:39.040]   the cloud is slowly moving us to. Clearly, this is what Satya Nadella is thinking. That's the future
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:44.480]   of Office. That's the future of Windows. By the way, I get a monthly subscription. I'm happy. I've
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:48.960]   got an annuity. The stock market loves that. My stock price is going to go up. Everybody's going
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:56.640]   to be happy. I think the hazard is that we talk like this as if you don't have cash-strapped
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:04.320]   municipal governments or school districts or hospitals or even highly specialized industries.
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.760]   That won't have the money to upgrade to this type of computing experience.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:12.640]   That's the long-dragging tale that's never going away. I agree.
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:20.320]   One of the use cases that I see and hear about back in the before time when I could talk to
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:24.880]   people at conferences is you'd have somebody who worked in an industry like say they were at a
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.760]   printing shop. I would find out that they had a computer that they still had an upgrade in
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:34.560]   from Windows 95 because there was a piece of proprietary software. They had somebody to write
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:42.480]   way back when. They were like, "I don't have the money to write another version of the software
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:48.720]   and migrate it again." We've jury-rigged this entire workflow around obsolete tech and we just try to
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:56.160]   keep it running. I think that happens a lot more than... Ten companies are willing to talk about it.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:01.200]   Look at Android. There are lots of people who are still running Macs that are not even
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:06.240]   OS/10 Macs because they're like, "I got this piece of software I write back in 1998. It does
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:11.360]   what I needed to do. I can't upgrade it." Almost all the security problems happen to that layer of
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:17.120]   people because they're not getting updated. They're not doing any... You know that the
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:21.840]   Microsoft Apple and Google would love to get rid of the $50 Android phones that haven't been
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:29.440]   updated since Cupcake. They would love to get rid of Windows 95. What? Stop!
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:34.640]   I mean, unless a member of friends is going to come and personally give you a new computer.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:38.720]   The author is being able to do that. Well, that's different. If Joey gives it to me, I'll take it.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:45.120]   That's a thing though. It's not even... It's not the person. It's not the computer. It's the software.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:48.080]   And that's where that... But couldn't that all run in virtualization?
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:50.240]   It's for prize. If you are going to run Windows 95...
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:55.440]   You have to find a way to fund these people's business workflows or fund these highly industry
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:02.160]   specific or location specific apps that still work. They just don't work because the person who
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:06.720]   wrote them 20 years ago wasn't thinking, "Oh my gosh, pretty soon everything we do is going to be
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:12.320]   living on servers that are in rural or wherever." But Windows Virtual Desktop, they even, my
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:16.560]   greeves up even says, "And you can run Windows 7." I don't know if they mentioned Windows 95.
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:22.400]   But I mean, that's the safe way to run Windows 7. That's how they... Or XP, or even, I guess,
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:28.240]   95. But you'd have to get that proprietary program up to there. And then there's the hardware issue
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:36.640]   because that line printer or that CNC hardware only works with a serial connection over an RS230.
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:42.480]   It's a 32 port to a computer running DOS. Then you're going to have a problem, I guess.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:48.400]   So until all of those small business owners who have those proprietary apps retire,
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.720]   we're going to be holding on to this stuff.
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:52.640]   Oh yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:59.680]   So it takes longer than you think. But it's... I mean, there's still people driving 1963 Thunderbirds.
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:05.120]   But in general, what you do is you upgrade your emissions requirements and you slowly
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:10.160]   face those people out and you slowly move into the future. And I'm sure that's what Microsoft
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:16.880]   wants to do. And then there's this guy who's booting up his PC from a vinyl disk.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.160]   Oh my gosh.
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:24.720]   Did you... What? My question exactly. So... What?
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:25.520]   What? Yeah.
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:26.480]   I just know.
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:26.960]   No.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:29.760]   This is like the most hipster thing I've ever seen in my life.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:29.920]   This is hipster.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.240]   This is like a wax mustache.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:37.680]   This is from Boggan Jr. the Boggan Jr. Blogby-o-g-i-n-j-r.com.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:43.280]   So first of all, you have to have an IBM PC with a cassette interface.
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:50.480]   That's the original 1981 IBM PC. And what you have to do is when this computer turns on,
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:53.120]   first it... Here, I can show you a video of it.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:57.600]   First thing that happens is it hits the floppy disk. You'll hear that first.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:02.480]   Oh, no floppy. Then it looks for a hard drive. Oh.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:11.440]   No hard drive. Okay. Fire up the cassette interface. And you could say, look, it says needle on the
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:16.320]   record. So you have to drop the needle on the record player. He's going to drop the needle on
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.440]   the record player. Here we go.
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:20.560]   This is the most steampunk thing I've seen in my life.
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:25.520]   He's got the audio connected to the cassette port interface.
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:29.280]   Now hold your ears because this is ugly when you're going to hear it. But you're going to hear
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:35.040]   what anybody who's as old as me remembers using cassette to boot up computers or to save
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:40.160]   programs. And you're going to hear the noise that we used to hear when that happened.
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:41.520]   Here it goes. We're dropping the needle.
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:47.600]   Okay. Slowest needle to drop ever.
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:50.160]   Well, you got to be careful. You don't want to scratch it.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:54.320]   And now it sounds like a modem a little bit, right?
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:58.160]   That's data. That's the master boot record.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:07.520]   Oh, it sounds like a record.
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:10.720]   Isn't credible.
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:15.440]   And then hard drive now detected because he and now the computer is booting.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:21.200]   I hope somebody somewhere is writing like the techno thriller where it turns out that somebody
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.240]   has smuggled a whole lot of data out of the country described.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.520]   Exist me. The sky is like nothing but hipster records.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:33.360]   Or they're like, oh, I had a really boring Arctic monkeys collection.
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:37.040]   Let's let him go. And it turns out and says, no, no, these are industry secrets.
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:43.440]   There is a guy who is always something to be gotten out of experiments, right?
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:48.800]   Like you're saying, why would you do this to show that you can? But then maybe there's something
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.760]   I don't know if I can find this, but there is a guy who's written an operating system.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:55:02.880]   For the end times he sees coming in the next 30 years, when China splits with us,
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:07.040]   they no longer make our chips or we can't figure out how to make them, whatever.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:12.320]   And all we can do is scavenge parts from speaking spells,
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.000]   just chips that are lying around.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.480]   And he's written an operating system for these simple chips so that we can,
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:26.720]   at some point get back to computing. The Teddy Rexman operating systems.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:31.280]   Yes. I wish I could find it.
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:35.200]   Something I can't remember the name of it. It's like the end times operating system or something
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:41.200]   like that. It's hysterical. So, but he says, look, you're going to be glad that I spend the time
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.080]   writing this because someday, because someday you're going to need it. Or maybe you're going to need
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:51.200]   a final record that can boot up your old IBM. I feel like we're thinking small. You should
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:56.240]   actually be looking at trying to make operating systems that reproduce themselves based on fungi.
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:58.880]   There you go. Something you can do.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:04.720]   DNA, DNA, chips. Something you can grow. And then you just save the seeds and you can grow into
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:10.400]   their computer. Maybe that's what the aliens did 5,000 years ago.
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:12.880]   Maybe that's what we are right now.
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:21.760]   That sounds like you just finished watching "Rays by Wolves." Yeah. Oh my god. Was that wild?
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:26.240]   But wasn't that frustrating at the end? We made no progress.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:29.600]   Wait, wait, wait. I'm watching this show. I haven't seen the end.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:37.600]   Okay. No spoilers. Okay. No spoilers. Let's just say that it's a journey.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:41.920]   It's a journey is right. With a destination that you may not understand.
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:48.160]   Yeah. But that's okay. But isn't she cool when she takes out her eyes and flies and goes,
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:54.160]   and people explode, that's cool. This doesn't make me want to watch it.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:04.640]   Well, what's interesting is the first few episodes were created by what's his name, the
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:11.680]   aliens guy. Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott. And they have a real Ridley Scott sensibility to them. You
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:17.680]   can see. And then it feels like Ridley left. I think there were different directors for almost
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:22.560]   every episode. Yeah. He did the first couple. And you can feel it. Yes. It feels like,
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:27.520]   I'm done with this. And then somebody else said, well, let's see where we can go. It's like three
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:35.680]   people wrote the novel. And at first it started to be an aliens prequel, didn't it? Don't you think
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.800]   that was kind of what was going on? And then it got weird. Yeah. I can kind of see what you mean
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:46.160]   by that. Yeah. How far are you? You did feel that way. And then it yeah. It took a left turn.
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:54.080]   Like four left. You know what happens when you take more than three left turns? You end up
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:58:01.040]   with the where you started. Yeah. You're like third episode, fourth episode. I think I'm the
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:06.960]   fourth episode. And I'm early enough in that not a lot of big things. No, no, it's about to
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:13.440]   yeah, get slow for a little bit. And then what? What? What? And then I feel like, wait, anyway,
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:24.720]   you hit what what what? And then wait, what? And then raised by wolves, which is only on HBO
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:35.580]   Max, I think, right? That's an ex-b
[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:41.180]   I don't know what happened. What you said that kicked that off is is the sort of like, is it
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:45.500]   was this all left by the aliens? Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm feeling it had that vibe. It's obvious.
[01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:52.460]   Boilers psychedelics are left alien technologies are left behind to mess with us.
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:59:02.060]   Right? Everybody knows that. No, maybe not. Maybe I took too many psychedelics and that's
[01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:08.380]   just what happens. I was here for a technology podcast. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Back. Back we go.
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:13.100]   A couple of things real quick before we wrap it up, because it is getting late. But I, but
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:18.620]   so was a lot actually given that we're in the end times. There was a lot to talk about. Google
[01:59:18.620 --> 01:59:25.100]   is becoming a bank. Google Pay is going to now, which is funny because Google did this once
[01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:30.300]   before with a credit card. Remember? Now they're going to start it by next year. They will have
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:36.060]   banks all over the world. They'll have they have a bunch of partners,
[01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:43.020]   launch partners, city and Stanford federal credit union. You're going to be able to get a credit
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:47.900]   card. You're going to be able to do payments. This has been the Holy Grail. I always thought
[01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:53.900]   this was what Apple and Facebook were going to do. And they seem to have lost their nerve. But
[01:59:54.940 --> 02:00:03.100]   in some parts of the developing world, like in Africa, M-Pesa is the dominant financial instrument
[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:07.100]   because they don't have computers. They don't really have banks, but they seem to have smart
[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:13.820]   phones. And so they're used that for everything. In China, WeChat is the complete, like is everything.
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:19.100]   And I feel like Google would love to be the everything company, right?
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:24.460]   Well, I think that they always try to pay Google's interesting. I can remember Google Loon,
[02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:28.460]   like making sure that in order for Google to succeed, everybody has to have an internet connection.
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:33.260]   And also for Google to succeed, everybody needs to be able to make payments. So it kind of makes
[02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:38.220]   sense. Let's make it easy for people to get access to things they might not have access for.
[02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:43.820]   And given how Google often behaves, it would make sense for them to go off, go for sort of the
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:51.500]   small transactions, people early in their economic life. I bet that's what they're going to do.
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:55.100]   And though if you're threatened by it, you shouldn't be because Google loses interest
[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:59.980]   so quickly, that next year it'll be something else they'll be doing.
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:02.380]   Well, I think that they would argue that David away from it.
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:03.820]   That don't work.
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:05.820]   Yeah, banks don't work, so we're going to do it better.
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:14.460]   But isn't that same, aren't they kind of improving or replacing their sort of,
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:19.660]   I'm not sure what the name of Google used for it, but it's Apple's version of the wallet app,
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:23.660]   where they're going to have all kinds of budget tracking stuff.
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:27.580]   But then they're also going to be collecting your data so that they can
[02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:30.940]   tell you what you should buy with the money that they're
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:33.980]   setting up for you through their partner banks.
[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:42.700]   We call that personal finance insights, deals and banking services.
[02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:44.860]   This is coming next year.
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:50.860]   Another thing Google's doing is Stadia. In fact, this is not just Google at this point.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:55.900]   Microsoft with their streaming gaming service, XCloud, NVIDIA with their streaming gaming service,
[02:01:55.900 --> 02:02:03.580]   GeForce. All have solved the Apple store problem the same way with a web app, a progressive web app
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:10.460]   running in Safari. You can play Fortnite. You'll be able to play Cyberpunk 27/7 when it comes out,
[02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:15.900]   December 10th. GeForce now works on Chromebooks, but it's going to be
[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:23.100]   coming soon. I think this is the proof of concept for streaming Windows, because if you can stream
[02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:28.460]   AAA game titles, you can definitely stream Windows.
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:36.380]   What's really interesting about this is when the
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:39.820]   hearings, the antitrust hearings and things like that were coming up and they were saying,
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:44.780]   "Well, what developers have to use your app platform if they want to have apps?
[02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:51.020]   And how is that fair?" Apple over and over and over again said, "Make a web app." They just
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:54.700]   like shrug their shoulders. That's not a problem. Make a web app. And finally,
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:03:03.020]   they took them up on it. I would rather be able to have that direct user experience with the app
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:09.180]   and really get the most out of it. And hopefully someday there's a compromise that Apple can get
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:15.900]   what they want. And Google Stadia can get what they want. But for now, a web app, thank you.
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:19.980]   Thank you for doing that so that I can play these games from my devices. I'm excited.
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:27.740]   And this is the argument for these antitrust hearings, if not actual lawsuits, because it sends
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:32.540]   a signal to Apple, because Apple could say, "No, no, you're not going to do a web app either."
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:38.140]   They could pull the plug on Web as Sam or the services the PWAs require, but they can't now,
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:43.980]   because the government's looking at them. And they're, "Okay, yeah, make a web app. I guess we
[02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:51.260]   better stand by that." We'll see if Web as Sam and these tools are fast enough. My suspicion is
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:55.900]   they are. And actually, Apple may secretly hope that it works well, because on their M1 chip,
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:04:00.380]   people have said, "Well, you're not going to get gaming. You don't have GPUs. There's no discrete
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:06.700]   GPUs." Well, you don't need them because the GPUs are in the cloud running on Google or Microsoft's
[02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:14.060]   or Nvidia's servers. And all you need is an M1-enabled browser. Oh, look, Chrome is available for M1.
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:18.780]   That's interesting. That's really interesting. And then they also didn't, Apple, just announced
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:22.140]   that they're lowering that their take from apps that-- 15%.
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:23.420]   Yes. Yeah.
[02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:23.980]   But--
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:26.380]   --so maybe they are sort of setting the groundwork for that.
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:27.100]   Just--
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:29.660]   Yeah. It's 15% if you make less than a million dollars.
[02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:30.780]   Right.
[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:31.260]   And you--
[02:04:31.260 --> 02:04:33.260]   That's what, 70, 80% of the store--
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:37.820]   Yeah. That's a lot of small people, but it's not Google, Microsoft. It's not Fortnite.
[02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:41.180]   Definitely not Fortnite. Yeah.
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:42.060]   We heard that cry.
[02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:49.260]   But I guess you're right in the sense, Lindsey, that that's Apple also responding to
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:56.220]   scrutiny from government. Okay. Okay. And for anybody who's making less than a million dollars,
[02:04:56.220 --> 02:05:00.860]   that's great news. That's cutting in half Apple's take. So that's really good news.
[02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:06.220]   All right. We got to take a little break. We're running at a time. I don't want to keep you
[02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:09.580]   people too long. You've got shows to watch.
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:14.220]   Whatever else it is, people do. Islands to maintain.
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:19.180]   Islands to maintain. Actually, that's the real truth is, you know, I had the Kiki Slider
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:24.940]   Conference concert now. I really want to start terraforming. My Animal Crossing's Island,
[02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:31.500]   this is a bad problem. I am out of control. Our show this week, all of our shows had so much
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:37.180]   fun. We thought it would be fun if we made a little short video for you to watch. Here's what
[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:44.060]   happened this week on Twitch. Well, you know, this is, I think, year 18 of the holiday tradition
[02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:50.620]   of ugly Christmas sweaters. Oh man, is it? Are you wearing one right now? I am. At the bottom of
[02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:59.020]   this sweater, there is a place for an actual fire. What? Oh, that's so clever. Previously,
[02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:06.700]   on Twitch, iOS today, we're going to talk about our new iPhone. I guess it's big. I don't have
[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:13.420]   particularly big hands. I love it. And it is, it feels heavy, but that feels like quality, right?
[02:06:13.420 --> 02:06:20.860]   Security now. Where do most malicious Android apps come from? I'm going to guess the Play Store.
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:28.780]   Oh, Leo. Yes. The bulk of Android apps are not coming from unauthorized third party app sources
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:37.020]   and repositories, you know, as someone might think. Mac break weekly. Renee has all three of the new
[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:43.020]   Macintosh computers. We will, of course, be talking about the M1 chip. Oh, I benchmarked this. I did
[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:46.700]   the stonks version of benchmarking, Leo, because I knew that's only the only thing anyone to be
[02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:51.100]   asking. So I did the geek benches, the center benches, the GFX fan, anything that with the word
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:55.500]   bench in it, I think I did a park bench this week in Google. They're called fleets. What is a
[02:06:55.500 --> 02:07:00.540]   singular? Is there a fleet or are they just all fleets? Would you do a fleets? Is the verb formed
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:07.020]   to flip? I will flip the fleet. The fleet I flitted. I flitted. I flitted. I said, good at all.
[02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:11.900]   But it's gone. I flapped. To it. Bring your brain. We'll do the rest.
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:20.060]   Thank you to the great Jim Cutler, who is our our pro bono Vio guy. We appreciate it, Jim.
[02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:26.540]   I showed today brought to you by IT pro TV. These guys I've known since practically they started
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:31.740]   Don Pezzette and Tim Broome were IT trainers in the traditional classroom setting.
[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:37.900]   And they came to an NAB conference, National Association of Broadcasters Conference. I was
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:42.860]   on a panel with a bunch of people were streaming like we do a Twit. And they said, a little lightbulb
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:50.540]   went off. They said, what if we did IT training like Twit does podcasts we and IT pro TV was born.
[02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:56.220]   They have really grown a lot faster than we have. They now have five full time studios in their
[02:07:56.220 --> 02:08:03.660]   Gainesville, Florida headquarters, superb IT content for people who either want to get into IT.
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:07.900]   And so they need to take these exams to get the certifications to get those first jobs.
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:13.500]   Or people who are already in IT who want to polish their skills, get a better job, make more money.
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:19.420]   It is literally the best online IT education platform in the world. And you can learn about
[02:08:19.420 --> 02:08:25.580]   any kind of IT, whether it's being a developer or help desk support or a network administrator or
[02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:33.100]   business professional, Sisidman and of course security. And what's more, IT pro TV makes it
[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:38.940]   fun. These are real IT professionals teaching you. They love it. They're passionate about it.
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:44.140]   But they're also engaging. So you really it's the kind of thing where it's easy to learn.
[02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:49.100]   You can watch it on your computer, on your Roku, on your Apple TV, on any device you have.
[02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:55.820]   Put it on the big screen, listen to it in the car, watch it on your computer. And I know people
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:09:00.860]   leave it on all day and they're just constantly learning. And man, do they have the training,
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:05.740]   5800 hours of up-to-date IT training. That's why they're constantly working in their studios.
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:11.500]   They keep it up to date. This stuff changes fast, but they change even faster. 375 combined
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:16.780]   certifications. You're getting the best IT education around the official video training partner for
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:21.180]   CompTia. So if you're looking for those really fundamental certs that every IT professional needs

[02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:32.860]   Microsoft IT training, Cisco training, Linux, Apple security, cloud, whatever it is. Look at all
[02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:37.740]   this. They did this month is certain. Exis month, all November at IT pro TV, you can learn about

[02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:12.700]   It pro TV slash twit. Sad news if you're a fan of astronomy, if you're a fan of SETI,
[02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:21.340]   the big erasibo observatory in Puerto Rico. This was, I don't know, was one of the largest dishes
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:29.180]   out there. Two of the cables broke. It is 57 years old. And it is not salvageable. They're going to
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:35.340]   demolish it. Oh, the National Science Foundation said, boy, we would love to save it. But we're much
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:40.860]   more concerned about the lives of people that, you know, people visit the observatory, but there
[02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:47.740]   are also many astronomers work there. The towers are 300 feet tall. If the remaining cables break,
[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:54.780]   the whole thing, it's a 900 ton suspended platform could crash down onto the dish. The towers could
[02:11:54.780 --> 02:12:00.220]   fall over. They don't know in which direction. So they're just, they're going to, they're going
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:05.340]   to take it down. Sean Jones at the NSF said the decision is not an easy one to make, but the
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:12.700]   safety of people is our number one priority. So I thought I'd pass that along. You could see the
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:19.820]   damage that was caused just by the failure of the first cable. Wow. That is pretty rough.
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:25.900]   You might have seen it. That was very first seen in the post-apocalyptic sci-fi. Yeah, right?
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:30.060]   Yeah, definitely. Before you take it down, make a couple of movies. Contact was made
[02:12:30.060 --> 02:12:38.940]   Golden Eye, the James Bond movie. I think it started with Hurricane Maria, which caused a lot of
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:42.780]   damage. And then in August, another cable went.
[02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:51.340]   Let's see. Anything else we want to mention, Marissa Meyer has
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:58.940]   found a new company. She kind of, she was a big shot at Google, went to save Yahoo, didn't work
[02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:08.300]   out so good, sold off Yahoo. Now she's running Sunshine Labs, which is a contact management app for
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:15.660]   iOS. I think she really is a product person. She just really wants to do something cool with
[02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:24.540]   software. I got it for her because it was a content job. Yeah, I got it. It reminds me a
[02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:31.500]   little bit of Plaxo, which is not a good thing to remind anybody of. But what you do is you import
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:36.860]   your contacts into it. I don't like it that there's a big ad for the product here. They should just
[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:44.220]   start there. It does a few things. You see, some of my contacts are enhanced by Sunshine.
[02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:50.140]   I don't know what that means. And then people can, who are other Sunshine users,
[02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:54.860]   so my friend, Ralph Needleman, he sent me a thing. He was using Sunshine, saw me,
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:14:01.500]   said, could you update it? So I sent him my information. And then he sent me his.
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:07.180]   So he exchanged his info with me. So that's a little Plaxo like that behind the scenes
[02:14:07.180 --> 02:14:11.820]   sharing. It's kind of cool if I run into somebody, which I won't. But if I ever do,
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:18.060]   I can exchange info with them. So it lets me choose the info card. It's okay, you can show this.
[02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:24.300]   The info card I want to use. I have my personal and professional. But I can even
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:31.180]   select one thing at a time. So here's my birthday. I can send it to everybody. That's cool.
[02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:39.820]   I can make an intro inside it. So I could say, Lindsay, meet Lisa, meet Lindsay and send that off.
[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:43.580]   So that's kind of cool. Sounds like a little streamlined LinkedIn. And you're helping it.
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:47.580]   You're helping it create all sorts of data and social maps. Well, that's the other thing that
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:53.420]   comes to mind. Because they're getting all your contacts. Well, they're also seeing who your
[02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:58.140]   relationships are. They can probably log who you're interacting with and how frequently. And
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:02.780]   they will probably be able to rank you based on how much data you input into the system and
[02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:12.380]   how many people you manage to bring in. She's working with a long time colleague both at Google
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:21.180]   and at Yahoo and Rike and Rike, a manos Taurus to create sunshine. So I mean, you know, good for
[02:15:21.180 --> 02:15:25.820]   her. You're right. That's a good way to say it. She's a product person. People like her and my
[02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:31.820]   friend Kevin Rose. That's what they love. They just want to do new and interesting products.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:36.540]   So so good for them. Right? Side note, Ralph Needleman used to be my boss.
[02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:40.140]   No kidding. He used to be my ex-wise roommate.
[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:45.820]   Back in the middle. Yeah. Actually, Ralph's been on Twitter many times. It was just funny that he
[02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:51.260]   should pop up there. What's he doing? He he got into some other business than news, I thought.
[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:54.700]   I should check. It says he wants you to update.
[02:15:55.660 --> 02:15:59.900]   Oh, he's ever known. That's right. That's right. He went to ever known. I forgot about that.
[02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:05.180]   No, I love him. Yes. He was your boss at CNET or where was it? He was my boss at CNET.
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:09.980]   That's hysterical. Small world. It is a small world. Do you want me to introduce him?
[02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:16.060]   Unfun time. I can even tell it first. I can introduce you. Well, right now,
[02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:19.820]   it's invitation only. I was very pleased this morning. I got the text message saying you're in.
[02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:22.180]   - Oh, well then you have to invite me.
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:23.520]   - I will invite you.
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:25.480]   There you go, I will invite you.
[02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:29.700]   Why did I get this link?
[02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:32.780]   Oh, this is kind of depressing.
[02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:36.660]   So, I don't know.
[02:16:36.660 --> 02:16:39.220]   Have you ever watched a dry wall guy work?
[02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:40.060]   (woman laughs)
[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:41.420]   - Yes, it's amazing in part.
[02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:42.920]   - It's amazing.
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:45.000]   They're so fast, they cut it,
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.900]   they, or they cut it, they tape it, they mudd it,
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:51.220]   they paint it, and they work so fast,
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:52.660]   and now there's a robot.
[02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:54.340]   - Oh.
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:58.900]   - No, that apparently can do the same thing.
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:01.140]   It's canvas, it's gonna--
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:02.980]   - I don't believe it though.
[02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:04.420]   - You don't think they could do it?
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:06.700]   - I think that they could do it in like new construction
[02:17:06.700 --> 02:17:09.220]   where everything is absolutely plumb and square.
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:11.620]   - Yeah, in fact, that's the plan is to do it only
[02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:16.380]   on the big 10,000 square foot facilities.
[02:17:16.380 --> 02:17:18.900]   But in my life, 19,000 built house,
[02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:21.340]   there's no way that robot could do it.
[02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:23.060]   - And, Salen, you talk like somebody
[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:24.420]   who has real estate in the Bay Area
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:26.660]   'cause I've got a house built in 1904,
[02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:28.300]   and it's a thing.
[02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:29.660]   - Oh, but you know, you got a horse hair,
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:31.820]   lathe, and plaster on that house, right?
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:33.460]   - Some of it, yes.
[02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:35.580]   Some of the walls have been rearranged
[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:37.940]   over the course of the last hundred and some years,
[02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:41.140]   so I believe our bathroom has dried.
[02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:43.820]   - I wanna see a classic,
[02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:46.380]   John Henry versus the locomotive.
[02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:51.260]   I wanna see a drywall guy who's really a pro
[02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:52.220]   against this robot.
[02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:54.860]   I have to say this robot looks like it would lose.
[02:17:54.860 --> 02:18:00.260]   - Yeah, it just doesn't seem like it's that efficient.
[02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:02.100]   Look how big it is for one thing.
[02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:04.300]   That takes up like the space of a couple of people.
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:05.140]   - Look how slow it is, too.
[02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:06.460]   These guys are-- - And it seems like
[02:18:06.460 --> 02:18:07.500]   it goes kind of slow.
[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:09.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:10.900]   - Well, I'm wondering if people would buy this
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:12.780]   because it can be a business expense
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:14.180]   and therefore text deductible,
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:15.940]   compared to having the higher crew.
[02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:17.820]   I mean, right? - Yeah.
[02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:19.820]   - They have literally canvassed the companies--
[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:21.940]   - I think who wants this, I guess, is the question.
[02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:24.660]   - Yeah, well, I think the idea is a big industrial park
[02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:28.420]   where you have a lot of just flat square rooms,
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:30.380]   tilt ups, basically.
[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:31.300]   The company that doesn't-- - Yeah, that's the link
[02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:32.260]   that are more of those.
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:33.260]   - Yeah, right.
[02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:35.220]   Canvas.build has been,
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:37.220]   they've been in stealth for three years
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:39.020]   designing this thing.
[02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:42.860]   Artificial intelligence, drywall mutter.
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:46.380]   Just what the world needs.
[02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:49.460]   I think on that dystopian note,
[02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:51.380]   we could probably wrap.
[02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:52.780]   I should have saved the booting--
[02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:54.340]   - That's entertained. - Final vector.
[02:18:54.340 --> 02:18:55.180]   That's it.
[02:18:55.180 --> 02:18:56.580]   (laughing)
[02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:58.500]   Pat, pat, pat.
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:00.180]   Thank you so much, Lindsey Turntime.
[02:19:00.180 --> 02:19:02.220]   It's wonderful to see you.
[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:04.140]   We don't get John, all three of you.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:05.420]   We don't get John nearly enough.
[02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:06.620]   I'm really glad you could be here.
[02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:08.620]   Senior Vice President for Content
[02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:09.660]   and Audience at CNET.
[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:12.260]   I wanted to show everybody the project
[02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:15.220]   you've been working on at CNET
[02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:17.460]   for the Holiday Gift Guide.
[02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:19.420]   This is gonna be a little bit of a different year
[02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:21.700]   for buying stuff, isn't it?
[02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:22.540]   - It is.
[02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:23.380]   It's been interesting.
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:26.380]   People have been starting earlier,
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:27.660]   I think 'cause we're all stuck at home
[02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:28.900]   and we're worried about money.
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:30.100]   And so people are just coming
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:32.620]   for every single deal that I can find.
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:33.460]   - I'm a Christmas Eve guy.
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:34.460]   - So we're gonna help you out with that.
[02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:36.940]   - I'm the husband and father
[02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:38.380]   that goes out on Christmas Eve.
[02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:41.100]   And all I can find is one target.
[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:42.780]   It's open laid.
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:45.780]   And everything's wiped off the shelves
[02:19:45.780 --> 02:19:48.380]   so everybody gets the electric swizzle stick or something.
[02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:49.740]   It's like the worst.
[02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:50.580]   It's the worst.
[02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:53.100]   I'm a terrible, and I'm already planning.
[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:55.020]   I've already figured out, I've got lists.
[02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:56.500]   Like I never did this in life.
[02:19:56.500 --> 02:19:57.340]   - What?
[02:19:57.340 --> 02:19:58.380]   - Wow, congratulations.
[02:19:58.380 --> 02:19:59.220]   - I know what I'm doing.
[02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:00.060]   - Yeah, I turned it out.
[02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:00.900]   I'm helping with that.
[02:20:00.900 --> 02:20:01.740]   - Yeah.
[02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:06.060]   So you've got categories under 30, 50, $100, $250.
[02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:07.380]   Is it all tech?
[02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:08.660]   Oh wait a minute, toy lovers.
[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:10.420]   - It's not all tech.
[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:11.700]   We've expanded.
[02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:13.860]   - The baby Yoda plush.
[02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:14.700]   - Aw.
[02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:15.700]   - Ooh.
[02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:16.780]   - There's some good stuff in there.
[02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:20.740]   And we have people who are keeping it really up to date,
[02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:22.660]   which is what I'm really proud of.
[02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:23.500]   - Is that?
[02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:26.140]   - People working to make sure that if we're posting things like,
[02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:28.500]   oh, we found a good deal, we don't leave it up.
[02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:30.420]   - They need to rename this though,
[02:20:30.420 --> 02:20:32.220]   because it wasn't this the thing they used
[02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:36.460]   on the Crew Dragon as their zero gravity indicator.
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:38.540]   So when there was, right?
[02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:39.380]   Right, John?
[02:20:39.380 --> 02:20:40.220]   - Yes, yes.
[02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:41.060]   - Yeah.
[02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:43.740]   - When they got into space and they were in zero gravity,
[02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:45.860]   the little baby Yoda floated around and they said,
[02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:49.180]   "Oh, it's safe to take off our seat belts."
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:52.300]   So that's really, they gotta rename that sucker.
[02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:53.820]   The baby Yoda zero gravity.
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:54.860]   - Yes, also I find baby Yoda
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:56.220]   just conceptually manipulative.
[02:20:56.220 --> 02:20:59.380]   It's so cute that it feels manipulative.
[02:20:59.380 --> 02:21:00.220]   - Yeah.
[02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:01.100]   - I'm just, that's a side note.
[02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:01.940]   - Yeah.
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:03.420]   - Is it really baby Yoda?
[02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:05.460]   - Right.
[02:21:05.460 --> 02:21:08.380]   - It feels like the Ewoks, like you had the Ewoks in.
[02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:10.860]   - And what about those porgs, right?
[02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:11.700]   - Uh-huh, say it.
[02:21:11.700 --> 02:21:16.700]   - Somebody we know has a porg just over her left shoulder.
[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:19.100]   (laughing)
[02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:20.900]   - Does it have like the little suckers
[02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:22.140]   that you can stick them on a window?
[02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:24.140]   - That's not manipulative at all.
[02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:25.540]   Look at the size of those eyes.
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:26.700]   - Oh my gosh, it keeps.
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:28.220]   (laughing)
[02:21:28.220 --> 02:21:29.780]   - Now how much would you pay?
[02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:31.500]   (laughing)
[02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:32.340]   - It peeps.
[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:33.180]   - It's all wet.
[02:21:33.180 --> 02:21:35.020]   - I also have this too.
[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:36.380]   So I'm a sucker.
[02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:37.740]   - Oh, it's really small.
[02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:39.180]   I didn't think it was that small.
[02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:40.580]   - I got, oh no, these are different.
[02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:43.700]   The one I'm holding is different than the one that's on the.
[02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:45.620]   - That looks like a control doll.
[02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:47.620]   If you had hair on it to be a troll doll.
[02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:48.700]   - It's so cute.
[02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:49.540]   It's so cute.
[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:52.140]   - It's like engineered for cuteness
[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:53.260]   with the way that yours are.
[02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:54.100]   - Exactly.
[02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:55.180]   - It's a big eye.
[02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:58.180]   - So Lindsey, what's gonna be the toy of the year?
[02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:01.020]   Is it gonna be squeaky, the balloon dog?
[02:22:01.020 --> 02:22:04.300]   - I actually, (laughing)
[02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:06.300]   that is, that's really cool,
[02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:09.140]   but I hate to say it's gonna be game consoles.
[02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:09.980]   - Yeah.
[02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:11.140]   - If you can get one.
[02:22:11.140 --> 02:22:12.620]   - If you can get them.
[02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:16.060]   - Oh my God, I was up at midnight
[02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:19.260]   and then Walmart said they had someone Thursday
[02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:22.620]   and I got in at 12 noon and they were gone already
[02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:26.020]   and it's frustrating.
[02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:29.220]   I'm trying to get a PS5 for Michael for his 18th
[02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:30.340]   but I don't think it's gonna happen.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:32.940]   I told you, Michael, maybe for your 19th.
[02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:36.260]   - Along with everything else for Michael.
[02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:39.620]   - I know, well maybe I could find something you've got here.
[02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:41.900]   You've got a category called teenage boys.
[02:22:41.900 --> 02:22:45.700]   Dickie Eisenhower's work jacket.
[02:22:45.700 --> 02:22:48.540]   No, I'm not gonna give that to a.
[02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:51.580]   - Well, okay, but you're at least a good recommendation.
[02:22:51.580 --> 02:22:52.940]   - He would like it.
[02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:56.300]   See, maybe, see, see that no something I don't know.
[02:22:56.300 --> 02:22:57.500]   - It's really cool.
[02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:00.980]   - Why do they? - Dickie's is now a streetwear brand.
[02:23:00.980 --> 02:23:02.740]   - Does this is what Eisenhower wore?
[02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:06.020]   Why do they call it an Eisenhower?
[02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:07.940]   - Does look a little bit like a military field jacket
[02:23:07.940 --> 02:23:10.140]   like you could imagine him wearing it.
[02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:12.340]   - A Kodak projector?
[02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:16.940]   Oh, but it's not for slides, it's for TV.
[02:23:16.940 --> 02:23:17.780]   - It's for TV.
[02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:19.860]   So when your kid goes and socially distanced
[02:23:19.860 --> 02:23:22.060]   in somebody's backyard with their pod.
[02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:23.980]   - Oh, he would love this.
[02:23:23.980 --> 02:23:25.940]   - It's actually, okay.
[02:23:25.940 --> 02:23:29.180]   Okay, you're winning here, winning,
[02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:34.180]   or how about the Bagu 16-inch puffy laptop sleeve?
[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:38.500]   - Oh, I want that, that is cool.
[02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:40.260]   - It's like the sleeping bag you always wanted,
[02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:42.020]   but it's just for your laptop.
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:45.020]   - Oh, I would just be jealous of my laptop.
[02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:45.860]   - I know.
[02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:47.260]   - There's no hands in there.
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:49.500]   - You may have maybe like a snugging for people
[02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:51.700]   that could do the same thing where you're just there
[02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:53.860]   with your little hand sticking out typing.
[02:23:53.860 --> 02:23:56.500]   Well, if you put Velcro in the laptop bagu,
[02:23:56.500 --> 02:23:59.900]   you could, you know, Velcro it to your bagu.
[02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:02.180]   I do need something for that M1 laptop.
[02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:04.060]   It deserves a special thing.
[02:24:04.060 --> 02:24:09.700]   All right, that's a cnet.com.
[02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:10.540]   Is there a-
[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:11.380]   - It's called Holiday.
[02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:13.540]   - Just slash Holiday, that's easy.
[02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:15.300]   The Holiday Gift Guide.
[02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:17.100]   We're gonna, yeah, we're shopping already.
[02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:18.820]   Isn't that amazing?
[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:19.660]   - Yep.
[02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:22.700]   - It's not just Black Friday, it's Black November now.
[02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:23.540]   - It is.
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:26.460]   I'm, so all of the major stores are posting
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:27.660]   their Black Friday deals early
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:29.100]   and they're calling them Black Friday deals,
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:31.820]   probably because that's the most popular search term.
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:34.020]   But I bought something for my mom today,
[02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:35.860]   but it's on the Black Friday deal.
[02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:38.700]   - Oh, I want this.
[02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:39.540]   What is this?
[02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:43.420]   This is some weird,
[02:24:43.420 --> 02:24:47.700]   I want whatever that is.
[02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:50.740]   It looks like an office desk, but it's like, I don't know,
[02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:51.580]   but it's not-
[02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:55.220]   - It's like the kind, it's like one of those kneeling chairs,
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:56.060]   but with a desk.
[02:24:56.060 --> 02:24:57.660]   - With a desk attached.
[02:24:57.660 --> 02:24:59.380]   Good, that'll be good for my joints.
[02:24:59.380 --> 02:25:00.220]   - Good for your core.
[02:25:00.220 --> 02:25:02.500]   - I love this microphone, the Shurem V5.
[02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:04.140]   This is good, nice job.
[02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:07.300]   Cnet.com/holiday.
[02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:08.140]   - Appreciate it.
[02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:08.980]   - Your Holiday Gift Guide.
[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:12.180]   Oh, I bought a bunch of these.
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:13.660]   Oh, I love these, yeah.
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:15.660]   What's going, there it is,
[02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:18.180]   save your back with the Edge desk system.
[02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:20.380]   It looks like it might take over the,
[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:21.700]   you know, like it's got a robot
[02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:22.900]   and it might just kind of,
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:24.540]   (laughing)
[02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:25.820]   - You also need a lot of room for that,
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:28.900]   but again, speaking from a Bay Area real estate.
[02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:30.420]   - But you could fold it up.
[02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:31.940]   So this is what you need for the kid,
[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:34.620]   the poor kid who doesn't have a desk is zooming
[02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:37.660]   and is sitting at the kitchen table and you need,
[02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:39.500]   she needs a desk.
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:42.860]   We'll get her this, the Edge desk.
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:43.780]   - Oh, that's pretty.
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:44.820]   - Yeah.
[02:25:44.820 --> 02:25:46.940]   See, we've just sold a lot of them.
[02:25:46.940 --> 02:25:47.780]   - Yeah.
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:49.620]   (laughing)
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:53.180]   - Thank you so much, Lisa Schmeiser, Windows IT Pro.
[02:25:53.180 --> 02:25:54.540]   I'm sorry, IT Pro today,
[02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:55.380]   I always put the windows in there.
[02:25:55.380 --> 02:25:56.220]   - I see.
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:25:59.300]   No, well, we used to cover windows pretty exclusively.
[02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:00.140]   And then rebranded.
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:01.980]   So the Confusions understandable.
[02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:05.220]   - I apologize, it's IT Pro today.
[02:26:05.220 --> 02:26:06.420]   What you got going on, Lisa,
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:08.780]   anything you want to share with the world?
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:12.260]   - I wish I did, but our end of the year package
[02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:15.220]   isn't coming out until December.
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:17.380]   - You'll just come back in December then.
[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:18.220]   How about that?
[02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:19.060]   - It's happy, sure.
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:20.260]   - Of course we will.
[02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:21.700]   I know what Lori's working on,
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:25.100]   she just put out her iPhone 12 mini review.
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:26.380]   I love this picture,
[02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:28.540]   'cause it makes you look huge
[02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:30.380]   and the iPhone looks so beautiful.
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:31.940]   - But it is so little.
[02:26:31.940 --> 02:26:33.900]   - So little, let me see it, show us.
[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:34.900]   Do you have it there?
[02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:35.740]   Oh, it's great.
[02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:37.140]   You got the blue one.
[02:26:37.140 --> 02:26:38.820]   - Yeah, I did, I love the blue.
[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:40.340]   It's a great color, so yeah.
[02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:43.540]   - But now, is battery life okay?
[02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:46.860]   - It's fine, you know, it is lower than what I'm used to
[02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:47.780]   with the Pro models.
[02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:52.780]   I get down to about 25, 15 to 25% at the end of a day.
[02:26:52.780 --> 02:26:54.220]   So it's noticed.
[02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:55.580]   - I've got some left.
[02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:58.540]   - Yeah, and here's the thing though,
[02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:02.580]   it's so small that the idea of bringing a battery pack
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:05.500]   with me or getting a case that's got a battery,
[02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:06.860]   I don't have a problem with that
[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:08.500]   because the phone is so small
[02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:09.980]   that I'm okay with doubling up.
[02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:13.900]   So, and if I was gonna go somewhere where I thought
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:15.580]   I was gonna use a lot of battery,
[02:27:15.580 --> 02:27:17.860]   I would be bringing that anyway.
[02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:21.860]   Now I have a lighter, smaller phone and the battery pack.
[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:24.620]   I was gonna bring the battery pack with the Pro model,
[02:27:24.620 --> 02:27:26.980]   now I'm bringing a battery pack and my phone is tiny.
[02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:28.340]   So, it works out.
[02:27:28.340 --> 02:27:30.220]   - It's very cute.
[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:33.300]   I'more.com for that review.
[02:27:33.300 --> 02:27:35.980]   And of course, you'll be back Tuesday for Mac break weekly.
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:38.620]   I will not be here, I'm gonna take a couple of days off.
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:39.460]   - What?
[02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:42.940]   - Yeah, I know, I'm taking the week off to make turkey or something.
[02:27:42.940 --> 02:27:43.780]   - To collect.
[02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:46.100]   - For a three person Thanksgiving dinner,
[02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:49.700]   I realized we weren't gonna be able to,
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:52.900]   I ordered us eight pound ham and a 17 pound turkey.
[02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:54.700]   (laughing)
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:55.900]   We're gonna be well fed.
[02:27:55.900 --> 02:27:58.420]   - Please tell me that you're gonna use your trigger.
[02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:00.300]   - I am gonna trigger the turkey.
[02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:01.140]   - Yes.
[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:04.220]   - That is our pellet grill that you talked me into.
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:06.060]   And I'm so grateful, no.
[02:28:06.060 --> 02:28:06.980]   (laughing)
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:07.980]   I'm so grateful.
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:11.060]   I'm trying to figure out if I can like cook it for nine hours.
[02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:13.540]   Like if I could put it in three in the morning
[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:17.140]   or something, I don't know, I have to figure that out.
[02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:20.180]   But yeah, I got a nice fresh turkey from Diesel Farms
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:22.060]   and I cannot wait, I'm very excited.
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:27.060]   And then we also got that Oteri Pizzo-Ozeri pizza oven.
[02:28:27.060 --> 02:28:30.020]   Were we talking about that on Mac break weekly?
[02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:30.980]   I think we were.
[02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:32.820]   - I think so, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:37.820]   - So this thing uses pellets to make
[02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:44.060]   a table of stone wood-fired oven.
[02:28:44.060 --> 02:28:44.940]   - Yeah.
[02:28:44.940 --> 02:28:47.180]   - And so it's yeah.
[02:28:47.180 --> 02:28:48.940]   - Wood-fire pizza.
[02:28:48.940 --> 02:28:50.460]   I wanna come over to your backyard so bad.
[02:28:50.460 --> 02:28:53.740]   - Yes, we got so many cooking implements outdoors now.
[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:55.860]   Mostly 'cause my wife won't let me keep them inside,
[02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:57.340]   but that's okay.
[02:28:57.340 --> 02:29:00.540]   - But if there's ever a need for it, it's right now, right?
[02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:03.740]   Because like our best way, our safest way to interact
[02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:05.900]   with other people is in their backyard.
[02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:08.700]   - So I think that's a good justification.
[02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:10.500]   We were gonna have Thanksgiving in the backyard
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:12.100]   and we realized, well, it's gonna be freezing
[02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:13.100]   and it could even be raining.
[02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:16.540]   So we're gonna make all that stuff in this drive around.
[02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:19.500]   We're gonna make care of Thanksgiving and say,
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:20.540]   throw it as we go by.
[02:29:20.540 --> 02:29:21.980]   Here's your turkey.
[02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:22.820]   (laughing)
[02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:24.660]   Hold on, here's the stuffing.
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:26.700]   Thank you, Laurie, have a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:28.020]   I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:31.540]   Thank you, Lisa, you too, have a great Thanksgiving.
[02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:32.380]   - You too.
[02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:33.900]   - I hope you have a wonderful time.
[02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:36.820]   Are you doing a big one or a little one or?
[02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:37.660]   - Oh, me?
[02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:40.460]   - My folks live with us, so there's the five of us.
[02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:42.340]   - Oh, so you get a pretty big pod.
[02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:45.700]   - It's, last year we hosted 35 people.
[02:29:45.700 --> 02:29:46.780]   - Oh.
[02:29:46.780 --> 02:29:48.940]   - So this feels really small by comparison.
[02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:51.220]   - I bet you're looking forward to it, right?
[02:29:51.220 --> 02:29:54.780]   - I am, because it's just gonna be one day,
[02:29:54.780 --> 02:29:57.260]   we nailed down our menu, the turkey's already thawing out.
[02:29:57.260 --> 02:29:58.340]   We're really happy about that.
[02:29:58.340 --> 02:29:59.540]   - That's nice.
[02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:02.300]   And Lindsey, you've got a large pod too.
[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:04.580]   - Well, the pod, for lots of different family reasons,
[02:30:04.580 --> 02:30:06.980]   is splitting up and going to their other pods.
[02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:08.180]   - Oh, nuts. - For Thanksgiving.
[02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:10.660]   So no, actually, my boyfriend and I
[02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:12.860]   are gonna make duck cassoulet and take it to the beach.
[02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:14.660]   - Oh my God. - Oh, this is amazing.
[02:30:14.660 --> 02:30:16.500]   - Can I be in your pod?
[02:30:16.500 --> 02:30:18.260]   - Yeah, I really am looking forward to that.
[02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:20.500]   - Oh my God. - That's amazing.
[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:22.220]   - Oh, that sounds great.
[02:30:22.220 --> 02:30:23.420]   It's gonna be awesome.
[02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:24.540]   - Yes.
[02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:28.260]   - I bought a two pound bag of flageolet beans.
[02:30:28.260 --> 02:30:30.380]   - Mm, I just bought that same thing.
[02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:33.380]   - Suitable for making cassoulet,
[02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:35.780]   all I need is a duck, some sausages.
[02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:37.700]   Oh, I love cassoulet.
[02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:38.700]   - Yeah.
[02:30:38.700 --> 02:30:40.540]   - Oh, you're gonna have a nice Thanksgiving.
[02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:42.060]   - Oh, I'm so excited. - I have the choice.
[02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:42.900]   - Oh, it will be great.
[02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:44.740]   Are you making it or is he?
[02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:45.740]   - We're doing it together.
[02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:47.060]   We both like to cook, so.
[02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:48.500]   - That's so romantic.
[02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:52.300]   Wow, cassoulet on the beach.
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:53.660]   Nice.
[02:30:53.660 --> 02:30:54.860]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:30:54.860 --> 02:30:55.940]   This was a lot of fun.
[02:30:55.940 --> 02:30:59.940]   I really enjoyed our L-word version of "Twit."
[02:30:59.940 --> 02:31:00.780]   (laughing)
[02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:03.940]   Lisa, Leo, Lindsey, and Laurie.
[02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:04.780]   - Yep.
[02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:05.940]   - That wasn't it. - So fun.
[02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:06.780]   - Yeah, really.
[02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:07.620]   - Yeah, it was.
[02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:08.460]   It was super to see you.
[02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:10.100]   - Have a wonderful Thanksgiving, everybody.
[02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:11.100]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:14.060]   We do "Twit" at 2.30 p.m. Pacific
[02:31:14.060 --> 02:31:18.340]   on a Sunday afternoon, 5.30 Eastern time, 21, 30,
[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:20.300]   no, 22.30 UTC.
[02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:22.540]   If you wanna tune in, you can watch.
[02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:26.340]   There's live audio and video streams at twit.tv/live.
[02:31:26.340 --> 02:31:29.540]   It's kind of the unedited "Come As You Are" version.
[02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:30.580]   If you're watching that though,
[02:31:30.580 --> 02:31:33.140]   you should be in the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:34.740]   They're all watching live, too.
[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:37.380]   After the fact on demand versions of everything we do
[02:31:37.380 --> 02:31:41.260]   available at our website, twit.tv, it's a podcast.
[02:31:41.260 --> 02:31:44.820]   So you can download it and listen at your leisure.
[02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:46.420]   We encourage you to do that.
[02:31:46.420 --> 02:31:50.460]   If you are listening to a podcast though,
[02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:51.660]   you wanna get interactive.
[02:31:51.660 --> 02:31:54.540]   You can go to our forums, which are always available
[02:31:54.540 --> 02:31:58.340]   at www.twit.community, a great place to talk.
[02:31:58.340 --> 02:32:00.540]   We also have a YouTube channel for every show we do,
[02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:02.540]   including this week in tech.
[02:32:02.540 --> 02:32:05.940]   And the best thing to do probably is to go to
[02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:08.140]   your favorite podcast application and subscribe.
[02:32:08.140 --> 02:32:09.860]   That way you'll get it automatically the minute
[02:32:09.860 --> 02:32:11.100]   it's available.
[02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:11.940]   Thank you everybody.
[02:32:11.940 --> 02:32:13.460]   Have a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:16.460]   I'll be back next week for twit.
[02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:19.220]   I'm just gonna take a couple of days off in the midweek.
[02:32:19.220 --> 02:32:20.540]   But do have a great Thanksgiving.
[02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:23.580]   If you're in a country that celebrates Thanksgiving,
[02:32:23.580 --> 02:32:26.380]   I think Australians are doing it today.
[02:32:26.380 --> 02:32:27.380]   And the Canadians, of course,
[02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:28.700]   they celebrated in October.
[02:32:28.700 --> 02:32:29.940]   They're way ahead of us.
[02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:32.260]   But I'll see you next time.
[02:32:32.260 --> 02:32:33.100]   Another twit.
[02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:34.420]   This is the Canadian.
[02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:35.260]   Bye bye.
[02:32:35.260 --> 02:32:37.840]   (upbeat music)
[02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:40.420]   (upbeat music)
[02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:43.000]   (upbeat music)
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000]   You are the twin.
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:56.080]   Thank you so much.
