[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.340]   It's time for "Twent This Week in Tech."
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.860]   The show we cover the latest tech news.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.060]   What a week it has been, fortunately.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.380]   What a panel this is going to be.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.620]   Alex Wilhelm, my boyhood friend, joining us
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.380]   from Providence, Rhode Island.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.420]   He's a reporter at Tech Crunch.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.780]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.700]   It's good to be here.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.140]   I'm just glad to be in part of the country where there's not
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.980]   a hurricane right now.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.740]   No, I'm really thinking about everyone down south.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.380]   Well, we were worried about, oh,
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.620]   easy, fresh hurricane, but it didn't really do much damage
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.620]   to your--
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.220]   It did knock down a lot of branches onto my yard,
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.900]   but really that was one of our little trees in a pot
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.660]   fell over, but that was the extent of the carnage,
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.940]   so not too bad in Providence.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.620]   Yeah.
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.580]   Yeah, my mom's, of course, as you know, just down the road
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.900]   at peace.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.780]   I was very worried.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.140]   Power didn't even go out for her,
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.460]   which I was very pleased about.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.260]   Meanwhile, I probably should say this before we even
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.020]   get started.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.700]   Best wishes to our friends in Louisiana and Mississippi
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.460]   and Alabama.
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.460]   Please stay safe.
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.140]   You dodged a bullet, Dwight Silverman.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.340]   I know people were worried about big storm in Houston.
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.300]   And as you know, you have no drainage there.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.340]   Yes, yes.
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.820]   The early model run showed it coming to the Texas coast,
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.940]   and those quickly shifted east, which always is a relief to us,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.700]   but we've been through it so many times.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.220]   We can really say we feel Louisiana's pain.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.020]   No, this is going to be a bad way.
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.420]   This is as bad as Katrina.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.740]   Yeah, that's what they're saying.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.940]   And it's a test for this new levee system
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.820]   and the other things that the Army Corps of Engineers
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.500]   believe in.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.380]   Thank you.
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.860]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.380]   Yes.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.260]   So hopefully it'll hold back some of the damage,
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.300]   but there's no way to avoid some major catastrophe there.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.380]   Honk her down, everybody.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.860]   Don't be silly and go out and run around in the snow.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.860]   There's no snow.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.260]   I was like, Leo, rain.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.940]   Yeah, you use the problem.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.220]   You want to stay out of the flood waters in the south
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.860]   because fire ants, their nests, they gather together,
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.420]   and they float in these big islands.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.100]   They make rafts.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.780]   Yes, they make rafts.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.180]   And if one of them-- if you walk through one,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.220]   you're in big trouble.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.180]   Don't get in a fire raft.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.220]   Yes.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.620]   Also, when a studio with us, because we
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.540]   couldn't figure out where to put him,
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.740]   he came all the way out here.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.540]   We've been looking forward to this for months.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.780]   We thought by now everything would be wide open, but no.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.580]   It ain't so.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.620]   Oh, Dr. Owen, JJ Stone.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.700]   So he's socially distanced from me.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.820]   I can't reach you.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.740]   I am Aunt Pruitt, and I'm wonderful as always.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.340]   I am wonderful as always.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.900]   I'm so-- you know, Leo, let me come in this Sunday
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.540]   to fill in for a doctor.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.660]   We are the same person.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.740]   No, we can prove it.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.900]   I had a couple of donuts.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.460]   We can prove it.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.300]   Come here, Ed.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.300]   No, no, no, no.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.300]   I am Aunt Pruitt.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.140]   There was only one.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.780]   Wonderful as always.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.620]   Always show us your biceps.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.620]   No, I'm just showing you your biceps.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.140]   Because the camera angles too low, so I can't.
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.780]   When I lift it, it's not hard.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.260]   Get out of the shot.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.260]   Again, I am Aunt Pruitt, and I am beautiful as always.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.500]   I hope you two are doing who it's saying.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.540]   You brought your beautiful daughter, Leah, with you.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.300]   I did bring my daughter.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.340]   My view is great.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.220]   I got my kid.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.620]   I got Lisa in my view.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.140]   If I'm not looking at the camera,
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.940]   it's because Lisa's over there.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.260]   Everybody wanted to be here.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.300]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.540]   Anyway, it's great to have you.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.980]   You're visiting California?
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.940]   Yes.
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.220]   And it's time really visiting.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.220]   Not for all.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.860]   No, not for work, but again, everything shut down.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.260]   So we're literally just seeing our pods of family
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.100]   in different places because we don't want to go out and go.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.740]   First time Leah has been in California.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.700]   First time on a plane.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.060]   First time on a plane?
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.540]   Yes.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.380]   Was it fun?
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.380]   Is it fun?
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.260]   Are you having a good time?
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.300]   I hope you are.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.860]   I'm sorry your dad brought you to this.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.620]   I know.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.420]   Well, it's funny because I call sports radio back home
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.020]   and they're like, you're in San Diego.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.540]   What are you doing?
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.060]   I'm like making my daughter still suffer,
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.180]   listening to sports television.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.460]   I'm on the 405.
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.460]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.780]   I was listening to something.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.500]   We got all in.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.220]   I had time to sit there and wait on hold.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.260]   Two Eagles fans in the house.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.660]   I don't know.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.180]   Are you a Texans fan, Mr. Silverman?
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.300]   No, you know, I'm not.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.420]   I hate to say this.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.300]   No, don't say this.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.220]   Because it's being in Texas.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.900]   Oh, don't say it.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.940]   I'm not really--
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.100]   Don't go there.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.700]   OK.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.900]   It's better to be a non-football fan than a bad team football.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.420]   So I would--
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.420]   Yes.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.060]   Particularly in the case of the Texans.
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.540]   That's right.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.900]   And if you ever get stuck in a situation
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.980]   where someone forces you to pick fanhood,
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.940]   just say you're an eagle.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.660]   We're tough people.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.660]   Nobody's going to ask for it.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.300]   Eagles is good.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.660]   No, no, no, no.
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.860]   Look, you just say I'm an Eagles fan.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.420]   Now, back off.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.780]   Oh, my god.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.460]   That guy's crazy.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.820]   You know, I'm going about their day.
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.020]   How come you don't ask any questions?
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.780]   I understand Owen because he lives in the area.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.180]   But Alex, how come you're not a Patriots fan?
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.100]   Well, when I was living in San Francisco,
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.500]   several of my best friends are from the Philadelphia area.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.340]   And they were like, hey, we're watching the Eagles
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.100]   game every Sunday.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.340]   Why don't you come down and we would order
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.340]   and she stakes and watch the game.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.780]   So I've been to an Eagles game now.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.340]   I got Eagles material.
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.620]   I watched the preseason games.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.620]   I dig it.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.980]   And we were really good for a year.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.980]   And we've been garbage ever since.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.940]   But Hope Springs eternal that this season with a new QB
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.300]   and new coach will turn it around, at least to be a little bit
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.580]   better.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.500]   But the Patriots, I can't actually tell you, Leo,
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.420]   but I think about them on Twitch because of the editing
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.260]   rules.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.900]   But you kind of cheat a couple of words.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.460]   Cheaters.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.980]   Cheaters.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.540]   Cheaters.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.740]   And in short, just by listening to that verb
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.380]   is you are a decent human being.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.780]   And that's why you're an Eagles fan over a Patriots fan.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.860]   Because you are salt to the earth.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.620]   You are one of man's men.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.700]   And I appreciate you.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.060]   So you can suffer with me along for another 10 years
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.180]   until we get back to being good.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.500]   And that's true fandom.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.900]   You got to ride the hype.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.820]   And you got to roll to the valley.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.900]   So it's going to be a family.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.700]   We're in Super Bowls.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.340]   Exactly.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.020]   That's no but anybody can do that.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.500]   As a decent human being right there, it's a great answer.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.060]   We appreciate it.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.700]   We fell off real hard.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.100]   But no, the further you fall, the higher up you bounce.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.460]   Exactly.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.540]   I really hope exactly.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.020]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.780]   Well, I hate to bring down this Sports Talk show.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.020]   But you want to talk about tech?
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.180]   That's what I get for.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.700]   So my Apple watches--
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.460]   It was Twiggy.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.420]   --that we did yesterday.
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.300]   You promised me no Sports Talk today.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.540]   I don't understand.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.900]   This is supposed to be a tech show.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.660]   Did you see my fancy new little phone?
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.660]   Oh.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.180]   Oh.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.020]   Got the little Galaxy Flip 3.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.300]   I forgot.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.860]   And got the big old watch that goes along with it.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.860]   I forgot that I'm in the house.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.740]   Leah, do you know what that means?
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.380]   They have a vault of electronics that we--
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.460]   She's going to confuse me with Marcus Brown.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.700]   I don't have a vault of electronics.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.860]   We're going to rummage.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.900]   This is actually--
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.460]   This man's killed more drones than a war.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.380]   I do have some dead drums for that.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.220]   I was not a Galaxy Fold fan, to be honest with you.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.260]   I didn't really like it all that much.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.500]   But this makes, to me, for a folding screen, this makes sense.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.060]   It's so little folded up.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.620]   It's like a little pocket square.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.220]   In fact, I could put it in my coat pocket.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.620]   That's a great size.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.620]   And then it opens up to be basically--
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.100]   I'll put it next to the iPhone--
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.780]   a normal-sized phone.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.780]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.100]   I don't like that.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.380]   I don't need the bullet tablet phone folds because--
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.180]   No.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.020]   You got a tablet.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.380]   Yeah, that's not saving me space.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.260]   But that--
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.460]   Also, there's something about the smaller screen that folds.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.460]   It's not-- it really worried me the fold, too.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:32.940]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.980]   Really worried me.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.740]   I didn't get the Fold 3, but I did think, well,
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.740]   I should try the Flip.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.620]   And this kind of-- you can touch it.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.540]   It feels good.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.420]   How's the battery life on it, Leo?
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:42.940]   Luke's--
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.860]   Well, I've only had it since Friday.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.500]   It just came out.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.100]   But I went through all day Saturday
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.340]   and went to bed with about 60%.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.660]   Same thing with the watch.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.420]   And I have the watch.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.660]   I have all of the things that are
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.260]   supposed to kill the watch, like constantly monitoring
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.340]   heart, constantly on screen and all that stuff.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.660]   So I think the battery life is fine on both of them.
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.060]   And I'm pretty happy.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.100]   It wasn't great on the Fold, the Z Flip, the original.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.980]   No, it's still not as good as say an iPhone Pro Max
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.500]   or something like that.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.580]   Man, this is great.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.980]   The camera's nice.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.740]   The Fold is satisfying.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.740]   Yeah, it feels good.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.020]   I was worried it might be too stiff.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.700]   It feels actually--
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.620]   Yeah, and you could just peep your little notifications
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.420]   on the front of the screen.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.580]   See, these-- if I wasn't so cracked out on Apple,
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.260]   this is what I want in my life.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.820]   Well, I'm trying to get uncracked, frankly.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.220]   I just need to track my childhood at any given moment.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.780]   So that's why they got me stuck in the system.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.300]   She's got air tags on her boots she doesn't know about.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.420]   Oh, wait, never mind.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.740]   Oh, so yeah, the thing is, that phone is amazing.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.980]   And so if you get uncracked with Apple,
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.340]   then you get tracked with Google.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.340]   So one way or the other--
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.740]   So that's actually a good question.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.700]   In fact, that might be our first topic,
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.860]   because Apple's getting, of course, a lot of heat
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.860]   with the invasion of the iPhone with his C-Sam technology.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.660]   And that's one of the reasons I'm thinking, maybe I want to switch over.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.340]   Is it as bad on a Google platform, on an Android platform,
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.540]   is Samsung spying on me in the same way that Apple is?
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.860]   It's still Android, and it still-- it uses the Google's apps.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.260]   And it's essentially--
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.460]   That's that Google ecosystem.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.940]   Yeah, and of course, I use Google for my search everywhere,
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.140]   so they know what I'm searching for.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.260]   My photos, all of them, 60,000 plus on photos.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.660]   I guess I kind of don't--
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.860]   I've given up on--
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.780]   I've given up on the privacy.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.780]   Maybe that's the solution.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.580]   I have so many friends that just are, oh, I
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.580]   can't believe you have devices in your house or listening.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.460]   I'm like, you carry your phone with you everywhere.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.300]   Something is always listening to you.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.340]   If it was-- if you're that important,
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.220]   they're going to tap into something to get to you.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.340]   If nothing else, they'll stick someone next to you
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.140]   and just listen to you.
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.620]   So I mean, at this point, I've given away the privacy
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.740]   as long as they're not throwing all my pictures on the internet
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.340]   or reading my text messages out of someone.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.820]   That's like an invasion of my privacy.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.300]   But for the most part, I've given into that because I need
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.060]   the positive things that it gives me.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.900]   And it's free.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.820]   That's the other thing too.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.420]   If you want privacy, pay for it.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.380]   And nobody wants to pay for it.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.420]   Right.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:19.980]   Do you think--
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.620]   Charge me.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:20.980]   That--
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:21.860]   Charge me for it.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.540]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.700]   I actually-- I like that idea.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.260]   Facebook, $5 a month or whatever.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.540]   But no spying if you could count on it.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.100]   But they won't even roll it out because they know how people
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.700]   would have raged because even if it was an option, you said,
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.140]   look, is it a little more privacy--
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:37.620]   Is it a meeting?
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.340]   This is the option.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.260]   They'd say, see, they're tracking us anyway.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.220]   So they're going to do--
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.700]   Like, no matter what you do, they can't win.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.780]   So they don't do it.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.740]   Do you think, also, that normal people--
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.020]   Maybe you don't know any normal people.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.380]   Do you think that normal people are even aware of this?
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.180]   Or is it just tech insiders that really
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.220]   are worried about this stuff?
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.540]   Yeah, I think it's actually changing.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.140]   I think the privacy conversation has shifted in the last couple
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.740]   of years as people become more aware of ad tracking
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.740]   technologies and so forth.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.820]   We've all that weird moment when you say out loud,
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.180]   like, I really got to buy a grill and then the grill ads
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.380]   appear and you're like, oh, they're on to me.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.420]   Some of that's coincidence.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.500]   Some of that's the technology stuff.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.220]   But I think people do care more than they used to because they
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.340]   used to care not at all.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.460]   But no, the average Facebook user to Owen's point
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.660]   isn't going to start paying them.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.620]   But for me, given that I haven't been on Facebook in years,
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.420]   sure, I'm happy to pay for privacy,
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.420]   to pay for no ads, to pay for a little space for myself.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.020]   And I'm just going to be boring about this
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.180]   until I either lose completely or the internet changes
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:35.620]   a little bit.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.100]   But I don't like to make currently exist.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.580]   But an EVO IRC in our chatroom brings this up.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.860]   Do you want privacy to be a luxury good?
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.060]   No, I mean, that's the risk of saying privacy,
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.700]   but you got to pay for it.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.500]   Well, I mean, it's the way it is now.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:50.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.460]   That's the way it is now.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.140]   And it may not necessarily be that way for much longer
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.780]   once US regulators get hold of it.
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.660]   I'm curious as to what the data experience is in the EU,
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.500]   where there are a lot more regulations
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.700]   about what you could do with this.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.220]   Get this.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.340]   And I think that people are--
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.620]   do care about it.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.340]   One of the last stories I did for Forbes
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.420]   was a piece on digging into Tim Cook's statement
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:25.060]   during the last Apple earnings call, where he said
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:30.620]   they had a really good double-digit quarter for switchers.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:36.820]   And I talked to Tim Behren for this story, who basically said
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.780]   that their research shows that recently one of the big reasons
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.220]   for Android switchers to Apple is privacy.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.220]   So people more and more, I think, are paying attention.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.260]   But do you think now they're going, oh, that was a mistake?
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.060]   Or no.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.860]   Because I don't think what Apple's doing really
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.020]   is an impingement of privacy.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.060]   Although Edward Snowden wrote a piece this week that
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.780]   was scathing about Apple and security,
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.100]   saying this is a bridge too far.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.060]   As soon as you put stuff on the phone that is monitoring,
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.540]   it's done.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.420]   Well, I mean, think about the lack of ethics
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.500]   we've seen from governments using NSO group tools.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.940]   I think we actually have a story on the--
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:18.980]   We do.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.780]   We'll talk about that.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.300]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.320]   So we're going to run down and think
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.880]   about the rise of authoritarian governments
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.580]   within a special focus on digital surveillance
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.440]   and kind of like editing of what people can say and think.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.520]   It's not just China.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.620]   It's not just Russia.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.760]   It's also Belarus, et cetera.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.180]   And so if you build out this technology,
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.560]   people will use it for ill.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.020]   And it's fine for Apple to say we won't allow that.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.240]   But Apple's not King of the World.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.840]   And Apple will apply normal regulatory customs
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.480]   to their products.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.400]   And so it does worry me.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.640]   Even though in the best possible use of it,
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.760]   it makes perfectly good sense.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.920]   But no cybersecurity expert that I know or follow
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.760]   has been anything less than furious.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.000]   And I think that's a pretty good data
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.520]   point against the corporate spend.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.040]   Edward Snowden's piece on "Substack,"
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.440]   the all-seeing eye, the letter I,
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.960]   Apple just declared war on your privacy.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.120]   You were talking about the EU.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.440]   This is the story that kind of blew my mind this week.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.000]   The European Data Protection Supervisor,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.160]   which is nice that they have somebody with that job title,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.840]   the EDPS.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.600]   That sounds good.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.720]   Independent agency attached to the EU
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.320]   advises policymakers on all matters
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.560]   relating to the processing of personal data
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.760]   has recommended that personal data like search queries
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.800]   and internet browsing history should not
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.440]   be used for the assessment of credit scores
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.920]   and credit worthiness.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.320]   Which tells me that they are.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.160]   That they are.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.240]   Right.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.600]   What?
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.840]   Credit bureaus are a racket.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.200]   And they're racist too.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.160]   Don't get me started.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.640]   I've got a very nice credit score.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.840]   I can't get Apple Card.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.120]   And the only thing I can think of.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.800]   Yeah, I'm like, do you know that I'm black?
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.600]   Because my name's Owen.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   I sound very white.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.240]   I don't know why on the application digitally
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.600]   I haven't got in one.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.400]   Stone.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.160]   Yeah, I went to Princeton.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.720]   And I like an Apple Card.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.800]   I've shown up for many jobs and they look me dead
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.480]   on my face and say, Omar, I'm like, nope, oh, and it's so hard.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.880]   Oh, that's so bad.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.280]   Yeah, because it's like, and when I call in places like,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.320]   it's like Owen did they start on the weather?
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:16.880]   Like it's--
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.440]   No, no.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:17.940]   I'm alone.
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.640]   I'm like, Apple won't give you an Apple Card.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.000]   I think it--
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Hey, look.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.480]   Hey, look.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.000]   Hey, look.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.500]   Hey, look.
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.480]   I'm depending on my spending habits.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.120]   I'm in the high 700s, low 800s.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.840]   And I've been denied three times.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.360]   What do we do?
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.080]   Your fight score is in the high 700s.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.880]   You can't get an Apple Card.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.160]   I can't get an Apple Card.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.440]   And again, all I can think of is I
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.720]   got to change my profile picture.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.200]   Because how am I not getting approved?
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.160]   Well, clearly your search queries
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.400]   in internet browsing history show that you're a bad.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.720]   And I got like 30 Gs and Apple products.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.440]   I mean, I don't use Apple, but I'm like, they should
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.520]   want my money or give me my discount.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.520]   Anyway, so--
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.840]   So do they tell you why?
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.000]   Do they tell you why?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.320]   Oh, no.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.280]   I get that--
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.080]   I get that general email thing that says, oh, we cannot
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.280]   approve you at this time.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.320]   Please try back in three months.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.000]   I've never--
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.160]   By the way, it's Goldman Sachs, we should mention this,
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.880]   that is doing that.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.480]   But I've never heard of somebody not getting an Apple Card.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.920]   You're the first.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.420]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.280]   It's like fine.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.280]   Because I heard--
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.040]   I read articles before it was like, oh,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.960]   racial discrimination.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.320]   By people having a hard time getting a card.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.080]   And I was like, oh, let me try.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.880]   And I'm like--
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.280]   This is digital redlining.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.880]   I've applied three times.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.080]   And again, every time I've applied at the time,
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.320]   my credit score is over 760.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.160]   And I'm thinking to myself, how is it possible?
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.000]   You don't even give me--
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.520]   That's my mind.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.680]   You don't give me like a 500.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.320]   It actually gave me a $30,000.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.720]   Well, you're Leo LePort.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.080]   They know--
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.840]   I don't think they know.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.720]   Apple hates me.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.640]   They know it's me.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.560]   They know it's me.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:37.920]   They know it's me.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.320]   But Goldman Sachs loves you.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.760]   They get sexed.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.240]   They've seen the basement vault.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.240]   They're like, give them enough rope.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:43.960]   Let them hang us up.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.840]   Can I make snow sense at all?
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.560]   And so does your wife get an apple card?
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.480]   I'm single, so no.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.000]   But she's also called Cajun, the mother of my child.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.440]   So she would have got one anyway, I guess.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.280]   I don't know.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.120]   But how would Apple know that you're black?
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.880]   I have no idea.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.480]   Again, this is something I read a long time ago.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.680]   I don't know if it's real or not.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.080]   I just don't know why I can't get a proof of a card.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.440]   I just don't understand why.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.040]   By law, the credit agency has to give you reason.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.640]   Like I said, if I could pull it up, I'd show it to you.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.160]   The reason--
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.400]   I'll apply right now during the show and I'll tell me no.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:16.600]   And--
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.440]   Yeah, do it.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:17.940]   Do it.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.440]   Do it.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:18.940]   Do it.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:19.440]   Do it.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:19.940]   Do it.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.440]   Do it.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.440]   Actually, you don't want to--
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:21.940]   Apple card.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.440]   It's not the best credit card out there.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.440]   But it's still a bit interesting experiment.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.840]   But it's a point.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.740]   Watch.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.640]   Now you'll get it.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.440]   Now you'll get one.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:29.940]   Right?
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.440]   That would be what would happen.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.920]   That would be what would happen.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.000]   So the agency also suggests--
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.800]   this is not a law.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.000]   This is just a suggestion.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.880]   The providers of financial and credit services
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.160]   should not be allowed to use health data,
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.280]   such as cancer data, as well as any special category
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.120]   of personal data on her article 9 of the GDPR
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.400]   for the calculation of credit scores.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.600]   Apparently, they have been.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.640]   Apparently, they have been.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.360]   Now it's not a law, so they're just recommending.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.240]   It is possible, though, that the EDPS--
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:11.400]   encouraging policymakers will pass a law against using search
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.920]   and browsing history for credit scores.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.560]   Owen's actually now applying.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:14.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.560]   It's almost humiliating.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.880]   We did make Owen use the artist entrance today, by the way.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.800]   Owen came-- did not come to the front door.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.280]   Look.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.480]   He went to the back door.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.080]   But Owen, I just want to let you know.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.200]   That's my super secret.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.600]   I was going to say, I'm a rock star.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.240]   That's how I come.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.440]   That's how I come.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.280]   You know why you went there?
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.240]   Because you saw my car there.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.200]   Exactly.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.360]   Hey, look, I go toward the power flows.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.200]   We're saying, I know what I'm doing, right?
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   And so he's sitting there.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.840]   I'm 100 degrees out.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.880]   He and Leia are sitting on the cement,
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.640]   expecting the power to flow.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.920]   I am a national treasure.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.880]   And when I show up places, I expect the CEO head of the house
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.440]   to come and open the door and allow me entrance.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   This is how I live my life.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.480]   I'm sitting in the studio doing the radio show.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.840]   And I see Owen and Leia walking.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.160]   You stop the show that brings in the money,
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.520]   and you come entrance to this house.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.800]   What are they doing?
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.040]   You bring me in personally, Leo, the part--
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.760]   So I just want you to know--
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.600]   I still cross the country.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.840]   You may not be able to get an apple car,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.240]   but you do get access to the artist entrance.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.880]   Lisa, make sure I'm VIP up in here.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.040]   That's all I'm worried about.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.440]   Get him a Texas-sized stone.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.040]   I'm worried about.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.720]   There's a back door to the studio.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.920]   I've been there like 20 times.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.920]   I see it.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.760]   So what are you saying?
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:23.760]   National treasure.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.760]   I'm just saying.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.600]   National treasure.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   I'm in front of you all in wonderful design.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.600]   See?
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.600]   Just front door only for me.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.600]   I'm in here.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.120]   Brutal.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.560]   Most people would be honored to come in the front door.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.280]   I'm saying that that's the normal way.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.840]   The only reason there's a back door,
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.920]   so I can sneak out.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.920]   There you go.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.920]   I hear you.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.920]   After a show, I sneak out.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.920]   The only reason we have a back door
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.880]   is the reason we have a back door.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.880]   We.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.720]   You and I, man.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.920]   It's our door.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.840]   So yeah, I'm flat out of California just to do that,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.520]   just to make a point now.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.680]   I will show you the key to the back door.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.920]   You deserve nothing less than the Eagles fan, Alex.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.520]   You deserve nothing less.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.280]   So we are learning more, as you mentioned,
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.640]   about NSO, O Group, and Pegasus.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.400]   This is the software that was used to hack iPhones.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:16.680]   NSO Group, which sells this spyware to the highest bidders,
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.360]   I guess.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.160]   They say, oh, we don't sell it to repressive regimes.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.080]   We're very careful about how it's that we sold to.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.720]   Apparently, they sold it to the government of Bahrain,
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.080]   which has been using it to hack activists and journalists.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.360]   The hacked activists include three members of WAD,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.560]   which is a secular Bahraini political society.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.680]   Three members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights,
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.560]   two exiled-- they're not even in Bahrain--
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.760]   two exiled Bahraini dissidents and one member of a Shiite
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.320]   Bahraini political society.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.400]   They were all hacked.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.000]   And we know they were hacked because their phones were
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.520]   submitted to the Monks School in Toronto,
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.480]   where they were analyzed.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.560]   And they found the evidence of the NSO Group
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.240]   and Pegasus on there.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.800]   So yeah, I guess maybe the NSO Group didn't think
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.040]   this was a problem.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.600]   Were they just operating on it?
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.440]   If we don't ask too many questions,
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.560]   we don't have moral culpability because every time
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.360]   the NSO group was in the news--
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.920]   well, it's always the same story.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.000]   It's always a government that we know is repressive or sexist
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.440]   or horrible in some other way.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.400]   And they use the technology to abuse journalists and activists
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.240]   and so forth.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.080]   I mean, does the NSO group have a client that
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.240]   isn't abusing the technology?
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.160]   That's a good question.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.080]   Well, I'm sure that the USA uses their tools.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.960]   These are the zero-click tools that you can send a text.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.800]   In fact, there's some examples in this article of the texts
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.280]   that were sent.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.440]   Here's an SMS message that an activist received in September
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.320]   after updating iOS 14.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.040]   It looked like a tracking message, a DHL tracking
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.400]   notification.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.200]   They don't know if the target accidentally previewed
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.800]   the link in the message while trying to copy the message.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.880]   But he was immediately suspicious and sent it over
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.280]   to the Munk School for Analysis.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.200]   Another activist who was living in London, a Bahraini blogger,
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.040]   Yusef Al-Jomri, is in London because he
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.360]   was awarded asylum by the UK because he was tortured
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.960]   in the custody of Bahrain's intelligence agency.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.320]   So when they say that they're vetting who is requesting
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.960]   these programs how to use it, how good are they
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.520]   even vetting someone?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.520]   Apparently not.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.240]   This person, working for a high-level person in the government,
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.160]   they could have fake IDs, aliases, background,
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.160]   they could make themselves, whoever they want,
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.840]   to get information from you and fool you into thinking
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.000]   they're a legitimate source for using your product.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.480]   There's no real way for you to check up on who's using it
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.400]   for what, really, if somebody wants to use it.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.960]   So you're just selling it, at least that's your facade to say,
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.440]   oh, well, we're doing our best ethically to make sure,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.760]   OK, well, how come out people keep using it in the ways
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.080]   that they're using it then?
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.480]   Which is scary.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.560]   Yeah, now we know about this on iPhones
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.680]   because the iPhone preserves the log, Google's Android
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.080]   deletes logs of these kinds of attacks.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.720]   So analysis has yet been able to show this happening on Android.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.360]   But I am sure happening on Android as well.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.800]   It's just that we don't have record of that.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.480]   Anyway--
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.600]   Well, I have a question about that, the last bit there,
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.720]   but the Google thing.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.080]   I'm not a security god, as you know.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.280]   So I'm very curious.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.200]   Where do we stand on just the general security level
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.720]   of Android versus iOS today?
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.680]   Is it close to parity?
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.960]   Is it still less?
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.640]   Where do you think it is?
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.080]   It really depends on who you ask, doesn't it?
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.600]   I'm of the opinion that they're pretty close.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.960]   And the reason I say that is, as far as the way
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.720]   the system is designed, all systems have flaws.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.000]   I would say both Google and Apple
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.400]   patch them as quickly as they're discovered.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.440]   There's a problem with Android because older phones
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.480]   aren't getting patched.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.840]   But if you have a late model phone from Samsung or Google,
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.800]   it is getting patched, I would say you're probably
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.400]   as secure as an iPhone.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.560]   There's problems with malware in the stores on both platforms.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.880]   There maybe is more malware in the Google Play Store,
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.520]   but we've seen plenty of examples of malware
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.240]   in the Apple Store.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.200]   So their automated checks in the App Store
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.360]   are not sufficient to prevent malware.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.040]   On the other hand, I've talked to hackers who say,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.920]   I would never carry an Android phone to Black Hat
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.720]   or to Def Con.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.080]   I'd never take it to a hacker convention.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.920]   They all say we use iPhones.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.280]   In fact, Phil Zimmerman, the guy who invented PGP,
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.280]   said, yeah, I would never use an Android phone.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.080]   Apple spent a lot of money on commercials
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.920]   to tell me how safe it is.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.120]   That's what I wonder.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.720]   Put a lot of billboards up in New York City
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.560]   telling people how secure their phones are.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.800]   Well, and I think that's--
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.240]   if there's an overarching story to these stories,
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.400]   it's that, yeah, Apple markets it and pushes it.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.760]   And just like I think Google works hard to protect you,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.160]   but there's no perfect phone.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.080]   And you're hackable, no matter what.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.520]   If you're a target.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.440]   People lock their doors and get their house broken
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.720]   into every day.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.920]   Well, everybody knows it.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.960]   A lock on the door is just a serving suggestion.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.200]   That's not actual security.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.680]   It's just a sign saying, please don't break in.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.920]   I mean, so that in premise is just how the world works, right?
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.480]   In a world where you've got doorbell cameras,
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.560]   all these video cameras, and people still
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.600]   break into people's homes with a doorbell.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.720]   They're literally looking at themselves
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.600]   light up on the ring, and they still just
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.000]   go kick in someone's door.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.840]   You think there's not going to be more cameras
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.240]   when you get inside the house?
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.800]   Do you think that we're not already trying to alert people
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.560]   to come, but people still break in?
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.880]   So if you're really--
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.720]   If you're really--
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.440]   A crook of these days, the last thing you want to do
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.720]   is physical theft.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.960]   Get into the ransomware game where you can really
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.240]   make some money without any real risk.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.520]   That would require reading and coding.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.040]   Maybe that's it.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:09.480]   You know what?
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.960]   All I need is a crowbar and a foot.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.880]   I mean, everybody's got a crowbar and a foot.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.360]   That's--
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.360]   Not everybody.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   That's the difference.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.640]   Not everybody has a foot.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.120]   No.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.200]   Well, you know?
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:20.960]   We got a shoulder.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.840]   You can lean into it.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.320]   I mean, I'm not saying I've done it.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.720]   I'm just saying these are things that you could possibly do.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.800]   I mean, it's easier to do--
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.320]   How's that credit application?
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.200]   By the way, we are already--
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.560]   Crowbar and foot is applying for an apple bar.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.120]   This is crazy.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.720]   I keep getting denied.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.840]   I just got denied again.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.360]   Thank you for your apple card application.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.720]   The issuing ban Goldman Sachs, a bank USA, Salt Lake City,
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.440]   branches, not able to approve your application at this time.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.800]   This decision was based on a whole or in part
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.600]   a report from a Consumer Reporting Bureau's.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.000]   Additional details are relevant to you at blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.440]   So you can now get that credit card.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.040]   You know this.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.200]   You can now go get that credit card.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.960]   I'll go check it, but I'm like, again,
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.240]   I'm my credit score right now is on 735.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.280]   Like, what did I do?
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.120]   Other people give me--
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.160]   Do you have cards?
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.560]   Like, I've got people just--
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:09.920]   So straight.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.880]   I get credit cards in the mail every day to take my money.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.720]   So I don't know.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.320]   But it's OK.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.960]   I don't need it because you know what?
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.920]   I should stop--
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920]   You don't want an apple card.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.000]   --apples stuff anyway.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.440]   Who wants to throw down a tattoo?
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.640]   You know what I need, Uncle Leo?
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.160]   What do you need?
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.880]   I need a black card.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.600]   Oh.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.440]   Do you have a black card?
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.960]   No.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.000]   The piece--
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.480]   It's show.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.280]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.200]   Lisa does not have a black card.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.280]   Let's talk a black card.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.840]   We can--
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.160]   See, I'm talking to the wrong person.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.120]   Lisa, we--
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.000]   What do you mean?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I'm a black card.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.200]   Don't tell me I already had a conversation.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.360]   You're already-- you already had a conversation, Uncle Leo.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.320]   I'm talking to the wrong person at this table, obviously.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.800]   The power of a black card.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.200]   I'll go--
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.320]   I was wondering why she said, oh, you're
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.000]   flying commercial.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.120]   She's been laughing at you for a good eight years now.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.880]   Like, she's literally like, what reservation?
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.880]   Concert, that's how she's getting these fancy tickets
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.960]   up close, because black cards, she just calls her concierge,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.920]   and they make everything.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.960]   But I deserve--
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.000]   See, I'm rolling with the wrong person.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.800]   If you have a black card, you shouldn't have heard that
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.600]   on your Hussey.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.760]   Look, because you can't be trusted, Uncle Leo.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.320]   No, she's--
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.760]   Lisa knows better.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.360]   But I can be trusted.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.160]   I am family.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.960]   I want to get on that train.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:18.800]   I want to take a break.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.880]   And I want to read you a text message
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.720]   that I got from T-Mobile this week.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.920]   Not a happy text message.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.400]   It's nice to have Owen J. J. Stone in the studio.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.320]   The only negative is I can't cut his mic.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320]   I know.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.320]   It's the worst.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.760]   I don't have control over the audio.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.000]   You're really-- you just hear.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.160]   There's nothing we can do about it.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.960]   I'm Aunt Pruitt, and I'm full of noise.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.400]   Gotta keep saying it.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.560]   Iqmz.com, oh, doctor.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.760]   And if you would like to text him in the middle of the show--
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:53.800]   Well, people offer him credit 844-9864-56-3.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.520]   We laugh, because it's better than crying.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.080]   True story.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:56.760]   Yep.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.080]   Also with us from Houston--
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.440]   by the way, I noticed your lower third Dwight Silverman
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.320]   says "retired" kind of.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.240]   Last time we talked, you had left the Houston Chronicle
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.400]   to go-- took a buyout to go to work for Forbes.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:10.760]   Yes.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.480]   And I was actually--
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.440]   I was planning to retire kind of from the Chronicle.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.320]   And got recruited by Forbes.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.920]   And I thought, well, what happened?
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.960]   Would they change their mind?
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.560]   What happened?
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.920]   No, I changed my mind.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.520]   Oh.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.440]   I liked it at Forbes.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.680]   I liked the work I was doing.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.760]   I was doing a newsletter.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.520]   It was fun.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.400]   And I was doing nothing but tech.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.440]   It was great.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.280]   But I realized, when I left the Chronicle,
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.360]   I thought, do I want to not work for the Chronicle,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.200]   or do I want to not work?
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.720]   And I got to Forbes, and I worked for seven months,
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.240]   and decided, I just really don't want to be an employee.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.160]   And I turned 65.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.120]   I got that sweet, sweet Medicare.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.080]   Oh boy.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.280]   And that's why I can do it.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.600]   You know what I can do officially today?
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.480]   Apply for Medicare.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.000]   Do it.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.520]   Do it.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.200]   My birthday's in three months exactly.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.240]   Today is the day that they window open.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:08.720]   There you go.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.680]   My birthday was last week.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:15.320]   And so I decided that I'm going to strike out on my own,
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.360]   or do freelance, or whatever.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.800]   But I just don't want to be an employee anymore.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.760]   And I don't have to.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.240]   No, you don't have to.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:24.960]   Good for you.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.640]   Well, you can come on this show.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.200]   If that's all right, we'd like to have you here.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.520]   I would love to come on.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.360]   In fact, since I'm retired and I have all this time,
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.120]   you could be here more.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.320]   I'll fly commercial.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.560]   And come out there.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.960]   It's too bad you don't know anybody here.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.400]   The black card gets you on a--
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.240]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.320]   Yeah, at least three.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.200]   But yes, I can--
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.400]   I would have to have the time now to fly out there
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.000]   and be there in person.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.960]   Well, good.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.120]   Glad to hear it.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.080]   Great to have you.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.480]   And there is a Ute in the house, Mr. Alex Wilhelm.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.960]   I don't know if we can call you a Ute anymore.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.160]   I mean, you guys are talking about being 65.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.240]   I just turned 32.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.000]   So I'm feeling--
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.560]   Oh, you're a Ute.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.760]   You're a crime.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.200]   That is so young.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.400]   Oh, my God.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.120]   I've had ARP cars since I was 25.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.000]   I don't know why you almost know
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.240]   when you've been able to benefit.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.280]   I don't know why you almost know
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.080]   when you get all the benefit.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   You're going to get all the benefit.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.040]   I was going to get your ARP car, brother.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.280]   Everybody jump yourself down here.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.280]   Great deal on it.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:19.960]   Great deal on it.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.440]   Great deal on it.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.320]   And hearing aids, you're going to love it.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.480]   Love it.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.200]   The discounts at 65 are awesome.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.280]   Are they really?
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:28.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   I'm just looking forward to the early bird special at Denny's.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:31.680]   I just--
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.200]   I can't wait.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.920]   We just traveled to Denver.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.680]   And like every place we ate, we could get 20% off.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.920]   And it was great.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.720]   I'm like, I'm not going to--
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.640]   OK, I'm glad you're happy.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.000]   It doesn't equivalent to being 32 again,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.320]   which I would be very happy.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.800]   There are benefits to 32.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.560]   There are benefits to 32.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.560]   And to 65.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.200]   I took a nap.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.360]   I took a nap the other day on the couch.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.320]   I was tired.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.280]   And I woke up and my neck was entirely the wrong direction.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.360]   And I was like, oh, this is the thing everyone talks about
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.160]   when your body stops working.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.240]   He's on the downslide of 30 now.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:06.920]   He's on the--
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.280]   He's on the-- he's on the old man.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.920]   I can't even have a cricket my neck nap.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.280]   That's the situation.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:11.960]   You push it.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.560]   You push it.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.480]   I'm pushing a good 38, Alex.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.640]   You're already on the downslide.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.800]   Alex, you know he's young because he's a reporter.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   That means he's out there hitting the street,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.200]   getting the stories, hustling for sex crunch, getting all the--
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.120]   do you got any breaking stories coming up?
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:30.040]   I got a lot of work to do on a couple of IPOs tomorrow morning.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.760]   Yeah, so we're back kind of in IPOs
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.920]   using after the August break.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.440]   So I'm going back to kind of finance land
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.720]   for a couple of weeks.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.040]   So I'm going to ask you a lot.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:37.880]   Next.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.360]   By the way, love TechCrunch.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:45.360]   It has survived the apocalypse of the Verizon.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.640]   Who do you-- who owns you these days?
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.880]   Ah, a very good question, Leo.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.320]   We are still in the exit portal out of Verizon.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.760]   And we have yet to fully dock with the private equity
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.080]   group called Apollo.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.680]   But that happens, I think, next week.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.320]   So it's finally happening.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.280]   OK.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.480]   I actually think TechCrunch has held its own
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.360]   and has stayed a really high quality source for stuff.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.160]   You've got great people like Panzorino.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.520]   I think you're really doing a good job.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   Yeah, Panz is great.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.720]   Yeah, we're trying to keep the old blogging spirit alive,
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.200]   you know?
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.520]   Journalism plus fun.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.280]   And we'll see if we can survive yet another corporate
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:19.720]   overlord.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   But so far, we're like four for four.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.560]   So here's hope.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.240]   Get serious.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.000]   Are you going to cover the Forbes spec?
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.400]   I have already written about the Forbes spec.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.960]   I have many opinions about that.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.560]   But I feel like if we go into that realm,
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.200]   I'll start saying things that got adjusted EBITDA.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.880]   And then everyone will turn off the podcast.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.520]   So you know, like--
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.040]   Lisa's--
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   Don't say EBITDA.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:40.640]   You said--
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.160]   Don't say EBITDA.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.040]   You said it adjusted EBITDA.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.200]   And Lisa's ears perked up.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.720]   She was all excited about that.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.320]   I don't understand.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.400]   This is why Lisa and I have always gotten along.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.280]   I'm going to try that tonight.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.920]   Oh, Lisa, adjusted EBITDA.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.160]   Give me your black card.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.400]   I don't know.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:56.920]   Not showing the--
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.400]   Hands off our black card, Leo.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.400]   Calm down.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:00.920]   Calm down.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.120]   You've only got turned down again.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.960]   Yeah, it's America.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   It just sucks.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.320]   I obviously, again, talk into the wrong report.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.200]   Yeah, I need to be talking to you.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.880]   I'm just trying to get to the show as quick as possible.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.680]   So I'll tell you--
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.040]   I'll tell you.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   I'll tell you.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.560]   I'll tell you.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.640]   You're a small business guy.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.040]   You tell me, text messaging is the way now
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.320]   to reach your customers.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.120]   Yes.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.040]   If someone trusts you enough to stay in their phone
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.520]   and they do not delete you, you have instant access
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.680]   to them and they have instant access to you.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.240]   Anyone who texts me, someone who just texts me
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.800]   from Trinidad to say hello to the Watch and Show Live
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   from Trinidad.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   Hello, Trinidad.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   Love Trinidad.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.680]   And I'm doing marketing and doing
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.360]   is I don't bother people that give me their phone number.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.200]   I replied every bit or text me.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.960]   I've had great conversations with people.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.080]   97% of text messages get open.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.400]   It's an amazing number.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.120]   I think-- yeah, I'm in 99% like everyone opens all my text.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.520]   If you're a business and you are not--
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.560]   you know, it used to be, I guess, in the '90s,
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.440]   you had a fax machine, you had to have an email address,
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.120]   and you had to have a website, then you
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.600]   had to have social media.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.560]   In the 2020s, you got to have text messaging.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.800]   That is how the best way to communicate
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.040]   is with your customers, especially now,
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.320]   as we've gone through the pandemic,
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.560]   because customers have everything's on demand now.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.800]   Get your curbside pickup from your favorite restaurant.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.240]   And by the way, they text you when your order is ready.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.920]   I'm going to talk to my doctor via Zoom on Monday.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.760]   Remote health checks.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.880]   Customers like this friction-free way of doing business,
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.240]   no matter what you're doing.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.160]   And that's why 90,000 local businesses of all sizes
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.600]   have turned to podium, the ultimate text messaging platform.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.040]   It's great for small businesses.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.560]   If you've got one location, it's great for big businesses.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.240]   With 1,000 locations, they can help you stay ahead.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.560]   And the thing you can do everything with text messaging.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.120]   Doing business with podium-- doing business
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.000]   is as easy as sending a text, because when text get opened,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.880]   business gets done.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.600]   All your employees can text from a single inbox.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.480]   They like that, by the way, because they
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   don't have to go to a lot of different places
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.600]   to talk to the customers.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.720]   And it's a much better, much smoother experience
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.800]   for your customers.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.360]   If the customer has a question, you send a text.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.800]   If when a customer leaves your business,
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.120]   you could say, how do you like it?
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.480]   Leave us a review on your favorite platform.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.800]   And you will get those reviews.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.720]   You just send a text for scheduling appointments.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.400]   For deliveries, send a text.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.960]   You could even collect payments with podium, with a text.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.640]   And by the way, that works.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.840]   There was a dentist in New York City
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.360]   who was using the old school method of sending out
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.760]   a bill in the mail-- everybody tears those up, ignores them.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.600]   He had $1 million in overdue collections.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.040]   Send everyone a text payment request.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.680]   Of the million bucks, collected $700,000 in just two weeks.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.680]   Wow.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.880]   70% text work.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.560]   Car dealership sold a $50,000 truck.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.920]   Took four text messages.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.840]   Wouldn't you rather deal with the dealership via text message
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.200]   than going in or calling?
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.480]   Of course you would.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.880]   Retailers are increasing revenue by allowing customers
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.160]   to shop via text message.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.120]   Jewelers sold a $5,000 ring.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.440]   Couple of text messages.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.160]   And even coordinated curbside pickup with podium.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.240]   Our local-- this drives me crazy, but it works.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.080]   Our local ice cream store sends me a text message saying,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.040]   every couple of weeks, we haven't seen you in a while.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.120]   Here's 30% off a pint ice cream.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.920]   That is-- that works, man.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.840]   That works.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.360]   Today's customers expect and deserve on demand everything,
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.920]   even from local businesses.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.840]   You could stay ahead of the competition with podium.

[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.680]   A growing business needs to scale.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.000]   They can handle it.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.920]   Get started free today.

[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.280]   Stay ahead of the competition with podium.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.640]   We thank you so much for supporting Twit.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.560]   I give you one more example on top of that for that.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.120]   As many times as I've been on the show
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.160]   and I give out my email address or things like that,
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.600]   I have wonderful people messing me.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.840]   Some people don't like me, which is totally fine.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.800]   But it's usually like in the 10 to 20 range of--
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.520]   after every show that I'm on, that I get Twit people coming
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.080]   directly to me to speak to me.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.600]   Nice.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.640]   When I put my phone around up there,
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.560]   it has been the first time it was 112 people.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.200]   Oh.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.160]   Then the next show, it was like 150 people.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   Tell people, communicate.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.880]   It's because it's right there in their hand.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.680]   And again, they were all shocked I was actually applying to them
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.560]   because I don't use it for a lot of marketing yet.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.280]   I'm just finding people that like the kind of vibe
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.200]   that I'm giving out.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:33.560]   I love that.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   And so I can put them in the Twit group.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.440]   I've got to set them off.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.040]   But it's just--
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.240]   We should set that up for you.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:38.720]   We should set that up for you.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.760]   We should set that up for you.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.600]   We should do that.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.560]   Because it works.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.280]   It's transparent.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.520]   Nobody knows you're using podium.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.600]   It just looks like you're--
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.280]   And again, it just makes it easier for the person.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.200]   They're sitting there with their phone in their hand.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   And especially if you want to have a conversation so more
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.520]   than just writing an email.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.480]   You know, you write an email.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.120]   You feel like you've got to write a novel
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.680]   because you don't want to waste someone's time as opposed to,
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.760]   hey, I thought this point was poignant for whatever reason.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.960]   And you can reply back and forth.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.080]   It's just more natural.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.560]   It's a natural way to do it.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   And you know, kids nowadays, I want to put the phone
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.120]   and talk to anybody.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:07.800]   Everybody can text.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.040]   I'm not reading messages or listening to voicemails.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.200]   I could read a text real quick.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:12.680]   It's good.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.800]   So I got a text from T-Mobile.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.000]   Great point.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.520]   I think it's 47 million customer records now.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.880]   That's what T-Mobile admits to.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.800]   I think it might be the hacker says even more.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.680]   In fact, a Wall Street Journal interview with the hacker
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.720]   said, their security was terrible.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.560]   I used off the shelf hacking tools
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.320]   to find an unsecured router.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.920]   And I was able to wander around inside the databases
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.280]   for a week exfiltrating customer information.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.680]   And by the way, what did he get and what's he selling?
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.800]   He got driver's license numbers, social security numbers,
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.000]   date of birth.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.240]   He got addresses.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.160]   He got pins.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.800]   Here's the text.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.560]   T-Mobile-- thank you, T-Mobile-- has determined
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.960]   that unauthorized access to some of your personal data
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.040]   has occurred.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.600]   We have no evidence that your debit or credit card
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.400]   information was compromised.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.680]   They don't mention the other stuff.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.320]   We take the protection of our customers seriously.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.160]   We are taking actions to protect your T-Mobile account.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.400]   A little late.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.360]   And we recommend that you take action to protect your credit.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.320]   So they're giving me.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:21.280]   I'm excited two years of free credit monitoring from McAfee.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.560]   This is why you need to live the life that I live.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.040]   I have a T-Mobile device on my tablet.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.120]   I didn't learn nothing.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:28.960]   I have a T-Mobile phone.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.720]   My daughter has T-Mobile phone.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.360]   But guess what?
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.840]   None of these things are in my name.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.320]   So whoever they got, that they got the injured credit card
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.480]   information ID, it's not me, uncle.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.080]   You got to live outside of yourself.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.680]   You can't just be giving out all your information.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.720]   I am not giving my information to McAfee.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.240]   I can tell you that right now.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.040]   That's for sure.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.040]   Thanks for working.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.040]   Free monitoring.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.040]   I'll be OK.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.040]   So who owns McAfee now?
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.040]   It used to be Intel, right?
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.680]   I think it's still Intel.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.680]   Still Intel?
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.840]   They were going to sell it.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   And then let me see.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   Actually, that's a good question.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.920]   I think they were going to sell it and then they decided not to.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.920]   TPG.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.800]   Oh, TPG bought it.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   OK.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   Thank you.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.440]   A large amount of money.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.920]   But it from the bottom majority stake from Intel.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.720]   I think Intel still has a piece.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.440]   But no, I'm also not trusting anything on my private equity,
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.440]   my personal information.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.800]   That's not the jam, as I say.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:25.040]   I just went out and froze my credit account.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   So it's free.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.040]   It's easy.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.040]   Now, you used to be.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.200]   They used to charge you to do this.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.680]   And they were used to charge you to unfreece it.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   Right.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.320]   But now thanks to federal law, they can't.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:40.200]   And so it's easy to turn it on, go to Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, just say, I want to
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   freeze.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.040]   I literally did all three in 10 minutes.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.720]   And now I can't get credit.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.920]   Just like I'm like you, Owen.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.200]   But you can use your existing credit.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.760]   And you can unfreeze it very easily.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.760]   They give you a pen.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   Right.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   It's very easy to unfreeze it temporarily.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   We'll get that credit card.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.600]   Well, the thing you really want to worry about, Leo, is one of the things they got was your
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:05.720]   I-E-M-E-I number.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:13.000]   And it's possible someone who knows what they're doing could SimJack you.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Oh, boy.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.320]   They've got a, they have a feature where you can go in and prevent unauthorized transfer
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.480]   of your number per line.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.640]   And I went in and did that on T-M-O.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.200]   Oh, I got to call them and do that.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.200]   Well, you can do it on the website.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.600]   You can do it on your account online.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.960]   But that's one of the things they got.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:39.200]   And that's one of the things that if they can SimJack you, your toast.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.440]   Real bad.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:46.680]   And I have to say it's terrible, but my bank and plenty of other places still use SMS authentication.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.840]   Even though we know it's terrible, it's better than nothing, I guess.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.840]   It's this T-Mobile thing.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.560]   People don't change their systems over people.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.520]   No, because you know why?
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.320]   Because they don't want the customer service calls.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.320]   They don't want.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.600]   How is this, what is this authenticator?
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.120]   I don't understand that.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.680]   How do I go ahead, Alex?
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.200]   Oh, I'm just saying like, you know, this whole T-Mobile thing makes me remember the Equifax
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.400]   hack to no end.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.720]   I mean, like, do you remember how they ruined everything?
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.920]   And then they got $48 for it.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.680]   And they made money.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.520]   I mean, so I free credit monitoring.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.000]   And made money.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Thanks, guys.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.160]   I froze my credit then.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.440]   I just haven't done frozen it because I figured why bother.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.880]   But I'm just really excited for like 10 years from now, T-Mobile to text you again, Leo,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.040]   and say, you know, you can have a settlement of 47 cents.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:31.560]   I know.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.240]   I can't wait.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.880]   Not your last action loss, which is around the corner.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.560]   Hey, you were talking about McAfee being bought and sold.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.960]   Norton has now merged with a vast, a vast merged with a Vera.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.200]   Pretty much there's only two antiviruses in the world at this point.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.640]   Guess how much?
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.040]   $8 billion.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.040]   Wow.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.040]   $8 billion.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:46:02.280]   So Norton, which bought LifeLock, so it's Norton LifeLock, acquires a vast shares.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.080]   Do people even use antivirus anymore?
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.080]   I guess so.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.080]   $8 billion.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.080]   Business.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.440]   I did not use any antivirus.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.520]   I used VPNs, but I don't think I used to.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.880]   It's used a lot in the corporate world.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   There's a lot of fun.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   Yeah, we use, actually, that's true.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.280]   We use Z-Set corporate, business Z-Set.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:18.800]   Okay.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:24.200]   They're a sponsor, but we use that because we don't trust our employees.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:30.520]   Yeah, well, all the internet keeps saying in the chat room says, yeah, corporate.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.520]   So it makes sense.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.680]   But at home, I don't think you need any of those.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:40.320]   But I do think we have editors using-- now I said it was Windows-- what version of Windows
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.320]   are they using?
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   I thought it was Windows 7.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.320]   It's 8?
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.320]   10?
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.320]   Even better.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   No, no, not 10.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   8.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   What?
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   8.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.320]   No one uses 8.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.320]   Are editors--
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.320]   Are editors at the last company using 8?
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.360]   We have a bunch of Dell Precision Workstations, and they're running Windows 8 and Adobe Premiere.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.360]   Is that punishment?
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   No.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.200]   They don't ever see it.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.240]   They just use-- they never gags it premiere.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.440]   They don't need it.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.160]   But I think we got it-- I don't know why.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.160]   We got it stable.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.600]   We don't want to mess with it, I guess is the reason.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.520]   Side note, private conversation I heard in the hallway.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.000]   At least it's got a black card.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   We're still out here on Windows 8.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.960]   I don't know what's going on here.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.720]   Obviously, you know all the resources are being allocated.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   Is it 8?
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.720]   What is it?
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.720]   Is it?
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   It's 8.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.720]   1.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.720]   Okay.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.560]   So Leo, Windows 8 is not being updated with security patches.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.720]   That's why we have to have an antivirus on there.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.040]   Because that's exactly right.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.800]   And the A set that we're using is patched for Windows 8.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   Yes.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   So--
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   Zephine the comment, old faithful.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   That's right.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:43.960]   That ain't broke, don't fix it.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.720]   All you need is a crowbar and a foot.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.440]   Hey, look, you're made.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.560]   Put your shoulder into it if you ain't got a foot.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.880]   We're going to get it done.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.880]   We're going to make it happen.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:57.160]   So a vast created acquired AVG five years ago.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:02.600]   Norton Lifelock used to be Symantec, but Broadcom acquired Symantec.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   This is all.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.320]   This is why we need people like Alex Wilhelm.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.240]   Broadcom acquired Symantec.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.920]   And so now Norton and Lifelock merged and now they're going to buy a vast, which has
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.360]   bought AVG.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.960]   So an Avira, I think, is in there too in the mix.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.880]   So it's just an antivirus monster.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.320]   But when we talk about cybersecurity, we don't really talk about antivirus as much these days.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   No.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.120]   I mean, we think of like end point security, for example, which is very different.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:36.240]   I'm not surprised to see consolidation later, just to riff for a second, because think about
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.520]   the consumer market for antivirus and how it has decreased.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.480]   You would kind of expect to see fewer players over time.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.040]   So the dollar amounts are a little surprising, but I bet the cash flows are pretty good, even
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.800]   though they're probably growing very much, if I had to guess, just thinking out loud.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.240]   But yeah, I mean, $8 billion will always be the kind of thing.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.440]   What do you think their adjusted Avira is?
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.320]   Well, I would say closer minus 50 bits compared to the last quarter.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.320]   So we'll have to see.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.560]   I'm sure Lisa, well, how did you tell them the spreadsheet?
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.560]   She's all excited.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.560]   I could tell.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.400]   She's like, oh, I love it when you talk at beaters.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.880]   Let me see if I can tell you.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:19.240]   It's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and what's the a more to station amortization?
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   Amortization?
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   Well, I don't know.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.240]   You want to pronounce it.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.240]   So that was pretty good.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.240]   Good.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.640]   So you always keep me honest.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.320]   He's looking over at my screen.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.400]   No, I can't wait to come back to the studio sometime.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.080]   I miss harassing you in person Leo.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.080]   I miss all of you guys.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.080]   You know, it's funny.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.760]   Of course, we've all been in person from time to time.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:47.120]   The last time I think I saw you Dwight was, could it be 2010 on the iPad?
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   It came out.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.120]   It was the iPad.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   Wow.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:55.920]   Although I think there may have been a subsequent CES that we ran into each other.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:56.920]   Sure.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   Right.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.520]   You were in person as we did a show was the iPad.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.520]   Right.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.520]   Right.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.520]   Which is, but I really, I will.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.880]   I think I'm going to, you know, at some point I'd like to fly out there and be there
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.920]   and I'd never been in the studio.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:09.920]   Please do.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.000]   We were on location with the iPad.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.760]   That was 2010, was 10 years ago this week.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.880]   Tim Cook became CEO.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   It's actually a sad moment in Apple's life because Steve Jobs wrote that sad letter saying,
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.400]   you know, I always said that when I couldn't do the job, I would step aside and that day
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.000]   has come.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.240]   And of course, that meant that it was time for Tim Cook to become CEO.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.760]   He said, I always said, if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.840]   and expectations as Apple CEO, I would be the first to let you know.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.560]   Unfortunately, that day has come.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.800]   Steve had pancreatic cancer and was really just months away from death.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.760]   I hereby resign as CEO of Apple.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.960]   I would like to serve if the board sees fit as chairman of the board, director and Apple
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.040]   employee.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:04.760]   As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.880]   Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.000]   And he said something prophetic.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.560]   I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.440]   And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:20.160]   I've made some of the best friends of my life at Apple and I thank you for all the many
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.920]   years of being able to work alongside you.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:27.560]   I remember, and I assure you to Dwight, when Steve took the stage a year earlier to show
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:33.680]   the iPad, we all kind of, at least inwardly, if not hourly, gasped at how thin and ill.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.760]   He was, yeah, he did not look good at all.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   But he was energetic.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.200]   You know, on the stage, he was, he was lively.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.320]   He obviously was still selling it.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.920]   And he, but his, his figure was just incredibly calm.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:56.660]   And a year later, August 24th, 2011, 10 years ago, Tim Cook takes the reins.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.640]   And I think, you know, we talked a lot about this on Tuesday on Macbreak Weekly.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:05.520]   You can look at Tim's success and say he took it, you know, from a company that was
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:14.160]   worth maybe, I can't remember, I think half maybe 500 billion to 2 trillion, 2 and a half
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.160]   trillion.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:19.160]   He had $2 trillion to the value of the company.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.360]   So are you skeptical on one, JJ Stone?
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.960]   No, no, no, no, I'm not skeptical at all of Steve Jobs.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.960]   Steve Jobs.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:26.960]   No, Tim.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.480]   No, no, I'm just talking about, and I give all this to Steve.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.600]   Steve was from the future.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.320]   He laid a groundwork that is almost coming to an end now.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:41.120]   Like the stuff that he talked about with their campus, all he was a man and a plan for the
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.120]   future.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.680]   Even the watch, which came out after his death was really his Johnny Island.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.640]   So I mean, Tim Cook, great cookies and all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.720]   But Steve Jobs went in a time machine, came back and said, this is going to be it for
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.280]   10, 15 years.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:00.280]   Now in five more years, if Tim Cook keeps this art going and I get something else thinner,
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:04.000]   faster, stronger, whatever, I'll be like, chop, chop, great job.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.960]   But Steve Jobs is just one of those men in history and time that saw what he saw, knew
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.960]   what he wanted.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:14.800]   So you think Tim is fighting that wave ever since?
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:20.600]   He is in a Tesla on autopilot with a destination pointed in the director for him to go to.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.600]   He is a little.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.280]   He's still there and he's got to check the wheel.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.440]   He's not inspiring.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.440]   You've got to?
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.440]   In the same way.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.440]   No, but he's a hell of a manager.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.600]   You can't say that.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.200]   Again, I'm not taking anything away from Tim Cook.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:36.160]   I'm just saying that when a great man in history comes forth and lays a blueprint for
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.880]   you, your job is to not fluff it up.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.760]   Your job is to make sure that you stay on course with what has been provided for you.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.880]   And he has done that in a great way.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   He's done that in a great fashion.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:51.320]   There's all kinds of twists and turns that he's had to adjust to the we can't see.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:56.240]   But I know that his outline is following what the architect laid out for him.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.000]   You are going to get the text messages.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   That's what I want.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.240]   Hey, this is where I'm at.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.960]   Yeah, I mean, I'm up here.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.960]   You're rocking.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.640]   I'm rocking with Steve.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.200]   But I guess we're at the end of his fruition.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.560]   I don't think we'll know.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.720]   Here's my position.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.360]   Tim Cook was the right guy to take the job because he was an operations genius.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:19.280]   He has made Apple run like a perfectly smooth machine.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.520]   The test will be, you know, this is a hard thing.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:27.520]   You're coming off of the most successful consumer product of all time, the iPhone,
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.520]   right?
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.760]   There's never been a product like that.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:36.240]   And he has driven Apple's fortunes for the last, you know, whatever years since 2007.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.160]   The question is, what's next?
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:42.440]   And if Tim Cook at the helm can find the next thing.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.240]   And Tim clearly thinks it's augmented reality.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.320]   He really thinks AR, AR glasses, maybe AR with a phone in the iPad, but I think it's
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.840]   got to be maybe glasses.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.480]   He thinks that's going to be the next big thing.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.240]   Maybe the second bet is cars because they're putting a lot of money into that.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.600]   The real test will be if they can bring that to fruition.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:05.360]   If they can't, then everybody say, see, he's a manager, but he's not an inspire err.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   And last thing I try to get on this just so people don't roast me, I fully understand
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.360]   his value.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.440]   The same thing with the M1 chip.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.480]   That actually is a big success.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:20.480]   I'm transferring that huge success, especially in a time of COVID and all these people needing
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.880]   chips, needing processors.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.600]   Now they're doing everything in house and they have leapfalled themselves into a position
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   of power.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.600]   Look at Tim debt.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   Other companies.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.400]   He went to TSMC and I said, I'm going to buy every chip you can make.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   Yes.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.760]   And as a result, Apple is not suffering from chip shortages.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.960]   Now everybody else is again, not take anything away from the guy.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:38.960]   Good to say.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.160]   All right, Alex, what do you think?
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.880]   You're the financial guru.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.880]   What do you think the.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.880]   I think we're under telling it to be days.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.320]   Look, I think Tim has done a simply tremendous job.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:52.680]   I think there's it's very fine to say that Stu Jobs was a visionary.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.680]   That's true.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.280]   And all visionaries are important.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.240]   And there's, you know, as Owen said, only a couple that really stand out here and there.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:03.840]   But I mean, the running of a business over a multi year period, a decade or longer, means
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.720]   that you've made so many decisions incrementally along the way that you really have kind of
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:11.160]   forged your own path, even if there were some product lines kind of under creation when
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.160]   you took over.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:18.160]   I think we should give him more credit because business is a team job and he's done a fantastic
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   job running that company.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.480]   Now, I will say, I think there's some hubris at Apple now and we're seeing that in the
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.760]   app store fees kind of fight them.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.760]   We'll get to him.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.760]   I'm sure later today.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:31.800]   But I mean, he, you know, took the stock by some like 15 bucks a share to like 150, you
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.560]   know, while expanding the company.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.920]   I mean, my gosh, that's, that's genius on a level that I can't really.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.360]   1100% increase in stock value.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:44.320]   So somewhere in there, I pulled a chart that's approximate, but it's, it's absolutely historical
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   what he's pulled off.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:50.840]   And so he also, by the way, I should point out, is getting a $750 million bonus for
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.520]   Apple on his 10th anniversary.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.840]   So somebody likes him.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.800]   I bet he's got an Apple card.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.000]   What's after a black card?
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.880]   What comes after a black card?
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.880]   There is no car.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.880]   It's literally just here.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.880]   I take things.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   Take things.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.880]   I'll take this.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   Thank you very much.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   Thank you.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.880]   Bill me.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.400]   Have you ever seen the, the, the yacht references to wealth?
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   No.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.680]   Like there's, I'll find for you.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.720]   There's a, there's a picture of a millionaires yacht and it's, it's just beautiful.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.720]   It's got a helicopter pad on it.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:24.060]   Then there's a billionaires yacht and it looks like a cruise ship with two helicopter
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:29.200]   pads and the yach docks inside of the yacht and there's a submarine and there's a submarine.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.200]   That's the billion dollar.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   I'm like, man alive.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.200]   Like, come on.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.680]   Like how much money do you do?
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.480]   And you're on there with like three people.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.480]   Like what are we doing?
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.480]   Who needs these things?
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.280]   No, you're not because you have at least 30 staff.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   Oh, true.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.280]   Well, as Alex.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.760]   Yeah, he's building the economy.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.240]   Alex, you're making, you're a job creator.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.280]   As, as hanging out with billionaires, those aren't considered people.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.280]   We just, oh, right.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.280]   Right there.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.640]   We don't count the staff.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.640]   We don't count the staff as personnel.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.640]   No.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.640]   You don't get on the boat.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.560]   I mean, to be clear though, I don't suffer from having a billion dollar boat problem.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:03.600]   But if someone listening to Twit does, I will happily alleviate that by showing up and taking
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:04.600]   it off your hand.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.600]   So just calling it.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.600]   You could be one of the people.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.600]   Dwight, get on his boat.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.600]   You're retired.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.600]   We can do it.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.600]   We can do it.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.080]   We can just walk ship in and start floating.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.200]   Actually, yeah, I'd like Dwight's opinion because Dwight, you covered Apple from the
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.200]   beginning.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.120]   You covered Steve's passing and Tim Cook's ascendance.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.400]   Has he been a, has he been everything?
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.320]   I think he's been everything they wanted him to be.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   I think he definitely was the right person at the right time.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.680]   He talked about him as a supply chain genius.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.440]   And that's exactly what they needed at that time.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:41.360]   I don't think that he, I think he has tried to or he has let the press give him a lot of
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.120]   credit for the watch as his like his product.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.880]   And it really kind of as Owen said, it was in the pipeline before.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:55.720]   And a lot of the things that Apple has done, they have, there's already been precedent for
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.920]   doing it.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:00.960]   So the M1 chip, which I think is really genius.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:07.440]   And we have yet to see the full results of being able to have the same chip in a smartphone
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.440]   and in a computer.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.280]   I think that that had been done before.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.600]   Apple had been through two other chip transitions.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.920]   They know how to do that.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.720]   And they have been working on this for quite some time.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:26.840]   There's a lot of precedent for what they do, but they're able to push the precedent forward
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.840]   and make it relevant to the current situation.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.720]   And that's as much genius as anything.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:38.920]   And I think actually I'm going to rewrite my, my comments because I forgot that that is
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:42.280]   clearly the Apple Silicon is something that had happened under Tim Cook.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.880]   Again, I probably could only have happened under Tim Cook.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:49.000]   Just to say it out loud for the people I love Tim Cook, I believe in what he's done.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.920]   I believe he is a great steward for this ship.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.200]   And I believe in him going forward.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.080]   I'm just saying.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.440]   Tesla was built.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.680]   You drive the Tesla.
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.280]   It's on a straight line now.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.840]   We're at the end of the vision.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.840]   It's saying it's full self driving Apple.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:08.760]   Till now we're at the end of Steve Jobs' vision of what he had put forth on documentation
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.520]   where you could read things that he said.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.680]   We're at the end of that.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.520]   But you can see that with the iPhone.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.960]   It's only been incremental.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.480]   Yes.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.840]   Upgrades of the last few years, although the latest rumor, and I don't know whether to credit
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:23.080]   this, is the next iPhone, which comes out in the next few weeks, will be able to talk
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:26.680]   to low Earth orbit satellites and won't need to use a cellular name.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.680]   I don't buy that.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.880]   Tim's had a crazy rumor that can't be thought in mind.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.880]   Tim's a genius.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.880]   I know he's a genius.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.880]   He's a good guy.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.880]   No, you want to give him credit.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.880]   Good for you.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:36.880]   Good.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.880]   He just doesn't want to get those text messages.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.880]   Apple corporate.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.880]   I'm actually already getting them.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.880]   It's right.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880]   The chat room.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.880]   I'm a man of the people.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.880]   The chat room is already on my back.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.880]   I got to go to the state of my case.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.200]   The trial of the century begins on Tuesday.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.440]   We'll talk about that as we continue on the show.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.240]   We've got Owen J. J. Stone in studios, you might guess.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.880]   It's great to have you.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:12.320]   I'm an pro at the
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.040]   target, but fortunately, the model shifted east, not fortunate for poor
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.040]   know.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.040]   Oh my gosh.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.600]   I'm praying for you, Louisiana.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.600]   We really are.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.600]   Alabama and Mississippi too, although I think it's Louisiana.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.760]   New Orleans is going to get the brunt of it.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:34.240]   Also with us from survivor of Hurricane Alree, Alex Wilhelm reporter at Tech
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   Crunch.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.320]   French hurricanes are so relaxed.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320]   So calm.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.680]   Relaxed for other parts of Rhode Island, but Providence just got lucky.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.280]   So we bought water and we canceled our plans and had this really relaxed
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.680]   Sunday, just waiting for bad things to happen and then they just didn't.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.320]   So I just got all in absent.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.280]   I grew up in New York near you.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.080]   I don't remember storms, but I don't remember anything bad.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:08.120]   There was a bad hurricane in 1938 in Rhode Island that was a killer, 160 mile an hour
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120]   winds.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.160]   That was when you were in high school.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.160]   I was in high school, right?
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.720]   So did that disrupt your schedule at all?
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.960]   The horses still draw the school.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.120]   No, that was fine.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.120]   It was fine.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.120]   You know, I got my knickers in a in a wad, but other than that, you know,
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.400]   everything was a knicker, bikers, knicker, bikers.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.400]   Alex, I like that.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.400]   Oh, reference joke.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.160]   I remember when Leo used to start talking to you about tablets.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.600]   They used to come with a chisel.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.200]   You know, I was saying, he knows the original tablet.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.240]   The original tablet, I mean, those were only the crowbar and a foot.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   You either chisel in a hand.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.840]   That Moses, the Moses guy kept bringing us tablets.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.280]   It was the work way they were heavy.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.280]   Leo didn't believe it.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.280]   He didn't get an alica.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.880]   He's all bought in, you know, now he's all bought.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.440]   Hey, I had a great conversation with the CTO of CrowdStrike the other day.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.960]   I really, do we have any of that sound yet?
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.560]   No, we're going to save that for later.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.560]   Okay.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.920]   I will get it on in the future because really interested to talk to him about how CrowdStrike
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   works.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   You've seen the headlines.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   I mean, God knows we talk about it all the time on security now and all of our Twitch
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:16.160]   shows ransomware attack after ransomware attack costing millions, holding businesses hostage.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.960]   And if you're a business owner, if you run a business or you're in security or attack
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:24.480]   at an IT at a business, you got to feel like just a matter of time before they come for
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.480]   me.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.480]   I know I do.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.280]   I know I'm thinking, you're going to have to decide the one thing you don't want to
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.320]   decide is do we pay or do we lose everything?
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.640]   Do we get humiliated in the public square?
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.040]   Do we lose our data or we give them money?
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.640]   You don't want to have to make that choice.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:46.760]   That's why you got to take the third option to feed your adversaries before the fight
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.560]   even starts with CrowdStrike.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.520]   You're not alone in the battle against ransomware.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.640]   They've done something very cool.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.120]   It's called the threat graph.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:03.560]   It's on part of the CrowdStrike Falcon platform and it uses information from everybody so
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.800]   that you know it's kind of you're all together in this.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.800]   You know what's coming.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:15.240]   A secure future demands a shared defense and that's why CrowdStrike's Falcon platform
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.360]   uses this threat graph power.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:24.960]   It uses advanced AI to analyze, like I said, a trillion data points, behavior from devices,
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:30.040]   servers, cloud workflows, all your allies who are also using CrowdStrike to find the
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:37.720]   threats to say, "Hey, here it comes and stop them cold because we know the response time
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.400]   is critical."
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:44.320]   You try to keep them out but if they get in there being able to detect them and respond
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.920]   to them and kick them out fast means the difference between losing everything or paying
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.600]   a lot of money or just surviving.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.000]   That's why you need CrowdStrike.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.320]   Their security platform delivers the most powerful set of tools in the industry today to fight
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.840]   the most sophisticated cyber attacks and I love it because it's all delivered through
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.040]   the cloud via lightweight, intelligent agent.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.560]   By the way, I can tell you it works for us through the study they found Falcon Complete
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.400]   delivers 403% ROI.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.400]   That's worth it.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.080]   By the way, 100% confidence.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.960]   CrowdStrike harnesses the power of every click, every action, every ally to grow.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.920]   They're stronger and stop cyber threats before they can stop you.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.120]   Check out Falcon Complete.
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:36.440]   It stops breaches every hour of every day through expert management, threat hunting, monitoring,
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.440]   remediation.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:42.280]   Back, by the way, they put their money with their mouth is by CrowdStrike's breach prevention
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.440]   warranty.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:49.320]   They guarantee it for Falcon Complete Managed Customers, a warranty covering up to $1 million
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.160]   in the event of a breach.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.880]   Terms and conditions apply.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.600]   That says, we know.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.640]   We will, they're your partner.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.640]   They're your partner.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:04.040]   Gardener Magic Quadrant named CrowdStrike a leader for endpoint protection.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.480]   In 2021, it's exactly what you're talking about, Alex.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.880]   We got so far beyond antivirus for ransomware.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.280]   You need endpoint protection.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.640]   You need AI.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.240]   You need those allies to keep you safe.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.240]   Join the fight.

[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.120]   CrowdStrike.

[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.840]   Don't just go to CrowdStrike.com.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.040]   Go to CrowdStrike.com/twit so they know you saw it here.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:46.600]   We want them to know you saw this ad on Twitch.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.160]   Thank you, CrowdStrike.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.360]   Back we go to the show.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:54.600]   Trial of the-- I'm calling it the trial of the century.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:59.200]   The Theranos trial, which has been delayed because of COVID and then Elizabeth Holmes
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.560]   had a baby on August 5th.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   The trial begins on Tuesday in San Jose, just 20 miles from the headquarters of Theranos.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:15.360]   Of course, Holmes is being tried for fraud.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.480]   Resurvers according to the Guardian are gearing up for fireworks.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:25.600]   Potential witnesses include such high-profile investors as Theranos former board member
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:34.760]   Henry Kissinger, Jim Mattis, Rupert Murdoch, Riley Bechtel, the former chairman of Bechtel.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.680]   They'll be hearing from the jury.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.840]   They'll be hearing from doctors who use the tests on their patients from patients misled
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:45.320]   by Theranos results, including a woman whose test results falsely signal the men
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.600]   of this carriage despite a healthy pregnancy, a man who was falsely indicated to have prostate
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:56.200]   cancer, and two others who received false positive HIV results.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.240]   She will not be tried with her partner Sunny and now this is going to be the thing to be
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:07.440]   interesting to watch to see her throw Sunny, Sunny Balwani to the wolves, and then Sunny
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.320]   in his trial to do the same to her.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.880]   Both are charged with defrauding investors and patients, making false claims about the
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:20.200]   effectiveness of their blood testing technology.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:25.560]   The government alleges the pair of defrauded investors by presenting ambitious revenue
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.640]   projections of a billion dollars in 2015.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.440]   The government says in truth Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos had and would generate
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.800]   only modest revenues, roughly a few hundred thousand dollars or so.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:46.280]   Probably a TV movie is in progress.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.280]   There's a podcast called Bad Blood.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   There's a book.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.040]   There's a book called Bad Blood.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.640]   The Kerry Hughes book is very good.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.320]   They made a documentary out of that.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.760]   Lisa and I watch that.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.680]   There's now a podcast as well which Kerry hosts.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.600]   He says if she's convicted and does significant prison time, it's going to be a shot across
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.400]   the bow to venture capitalists and startup founders in the valley that there are limits
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.560]   to how much BSing you can do, how much exaggerating and hyping you can do, and how many rules
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.560]   you can break.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.560]   You agree Alex?
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.560]   You cover this.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.560]   Whoo!
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.840]   So every startup likes to tell a positive story about themselves but usually they get
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.120]   around stuff by just not telling you certain things like what was your revenue growth?
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.640]   Well, we're not sharing that.
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.240]   Standard kind of BSing amongst startups is standard and fine and easy to see through.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.320]   The scale of fraud that we're talking about in the case of Theranos is kind of on a different
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.320]   level.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.120]   But the shot across the bow seems to be a slight exaggeration, more of like a cautionary tale
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.240]   for how bad fraud can be inside this world of startups.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.400]   But yeah, if you're going to do medical technology, you've got to have all of your ducks perfectly
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.400]   in a row.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.600]   Otherwise you will get into loads of trouble.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.920]   But here's a tip.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.880]   If a medical company has Henry kissing on the board, don't give it money.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.280]   That's a bad sign.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280]   There were no...
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.480]   I remember there were no medical experts on the board.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.480]   It was all well-known.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   They had a war criminal instead.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.480]   All known people.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.480]   Yeah, work.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:15.200]   I feel like if this wasn't a medical tie-in that no one would care about this and it wouldn't
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.680]   be a big deal.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680]   People scam with these companies.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680]   I mean, look at Uber.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.680]   There's...
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.320]   Again, I'm not going to say any names and cassages first, but there has been right fraud
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.320]   lies and scams with many a company, many a startup, many of these capitals.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.320]   But since this has to do with someone's blood or health, they're...
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320]   Well, you heard.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.880]   That is why they're doing this shot across the board to scare people off.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.120]   Like, this is more at the medical institutions.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.280]   Like, yeah, you can't mess with people's lives and their life like this and play around
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.720]   and try to make money off of it on top of it for no reason.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.080]   That's where they're like, well, we have to shut this down.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.320]   We can't allow this to happen.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.360]   This is going to be a difficult prosecution.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.680]   You have to prove intent, which is not going to be easy to do.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:11.120]   And apparently, based on the witnesses that the defense is pulling up, Holmes is going
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.120]   to...
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.360]   They've got witnesses on domestic violence and mental health.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.560]   Holmes is going to argue she was influenced by an abusive sonny Balwani.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.960]   And because he's not being tried at the same time as she is, that might actually work.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:28.040]   His trial is in February, and he could do the same to her and they could both get off.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.880]   Can we just like pay somebody to read the text message?
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.880]   Don't we have that service?
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.080]   Available so I can find out who bully to who said who to who.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.920]   Like at this point, everybody should go to jail.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.560]   Because again, it's not your normal business scam.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:47.520]   You know, women thinking they're losing their child, someone thinking they have a disease
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.840]   when they don't like, I don't care what you say.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.560]   They're both going to jail.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.560]   I wish.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.200]   Hopefully, because that's something that needs to be shut down.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.520]   I'm going to put you or me on the jury.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520]   And put me on there.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520]   No.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.400]   I just want to hear the information and the fact presented to me on each side.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.760]   You definitely not put you on the jury.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.480]   I'm trying to plead my case.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.120]   Let me plead against me, man.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.400]   You can't say you can't say I'm impartial because that just guarantees that you know.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.400]   They know.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.400]   Oh, no, that's right.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   I want to hear the facts.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.920]   I will make up my mind at the end of the trial.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.240]   I want to hear both sides.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.760]   Alex, Sam and partial just lied to the people.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.280]   If I can't say myself, you know, you know, it was a man in less less partisan.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:35.920]   The one day you do want to be in the jury, experts thinking, again, this is the Guardian,
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:42.040]   that Holmes will take the stand that will testify on behalf, which will be that'll be
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.640]   something to see.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:44.640]   That'll be something to see.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.640]   Very interesting.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.440]   It's just going to be televised or is this one I wish.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.520]   I wish this would be so great to watch.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.520]   I don't know.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.800]   But it on paper view.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.920]   I mean, I'd cough up at least $100 to watch this thing.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.920]   Right?
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   No, I just want to watch it.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.560]   They did settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.280]   She paid a half million dollar penalty, but did not agree.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.520]   Do not admit or deny the charges.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.880]   So I hate that.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.040]   I hate that so much.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.040]   Pay a fine.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   Don't admit anything.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.560]   Why do we let people get off without admitting guilt?
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.720]   We should just be like, OK, it's $50 trillion if you don't want to admit anything because
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.920]   it just seems like a slap on the wrist.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.760]   Half a million dollars to a person who raised that much money and paid themselves a lot
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.760]   of it.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.920]   I think half a million is inadequate.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:30.920]   Yeah, she may.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.200]   It should be at least a million.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:39.880]   We live in a world where a kid still sneakers because he can't afford shoes, gets sent to
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.520]   Rikers Island for six months waiting for a trial and then commits suicide because he
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.440]   cannot even get a trial date.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.920]   And people like this who are ruining people's lives and scaring the mess out of them just
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.880]   get to pay a fine that is pennies on the dollar and then go and blame someone else for
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.440]   their blatant mistakes.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.440]   That is America.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.280]   It makes me so enraged and angry.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.760]   And I think it's a little to blame it.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.280]   This show where the black turtilex, the jeans, she was the female Steve Jobs.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.680]   She was on the cover of magazines.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:17.040]   The story was so good that the media couldn't help but kind of give her glowing coverage
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.480]   without any expertise without really examining it.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.200]   And as you point out, the people on the board were not medical experts.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.160]   It was Secretary of Defense, Mad Dog Mattis.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:31.880]   It was former Secretary of State George Schultz, it was former War Criminal Henry Kissinger.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.240]   Those, none of those people.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.960]   I don't think you could be a former war criminal.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   I think that sticks with that.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.440]   That's where those career things.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.080]   Ex-war criminal.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.640]   She was the world's youngest self-made female self-made billionaire.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.440]   I mean, she might have got bullied by her board if you just read off the name of the
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.440]   board.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.440]   You can scale.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.440]   Oh, it's a bunch of old guys.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.840]   Each age of that board is 147.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.840]   She's bullied and bent.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840]   They were drooling.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.320]   She, of course, has pled not guilty.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:57.720]   And this will be anyway.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.520]   Don't you think now?
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.520]   Not the trail of the century.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.520]   I mean, the century is young.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520]   We're just kicking it off.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520]   It could be the kickoff trial of the century.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.520]   The first trial of this century.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.520]   Start of the century.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520]   The preseason.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.520]   Only fan says, "Okay, porn, go ahead."
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.520]   Look.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.520]   Let me tell you something.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.520]   I love this story.
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.920]   I've said on the show, many a time hot Twitter could make yourself a bunch of money.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.800]   Only fans is one of those things where they were being attacked by a group that attacked
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:32.000]   porn hub the same way and had them readjust to clean up their site, which is good because
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.600]   they didn't need some cleaning up and that didn't need to happen.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.600]   There was revenge porn on there.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.600]   There was non-consensual porn.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600]   Yes.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.560]   And so all that stuff, they needed to be cleaned up.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.400]   But then that same company was like, "Huh, if we can make the biggest site bow down, let's
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.920]   go attack someone else and they just raise money and raise money and raise money."
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.400]   Again, people are pocketing money on the side just to go and virtue signal towards something
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.400]   else.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.040]   So you want to go after OnlyFans and OnlyFans is like, "I guess we have to curtail to YouTube
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.840]   because if you broke them, you're going to break us and we need to get this one."
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.280]   But guess what?
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.360]   I will tell you one thing.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.320]   One of the oldest professions in the world is people paying for services that they want.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.880]   And so when someone is trying to take away the service you want, OnlyFans is like, "What
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.800]   do you mean 40% of our constituents have left in three days?"
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:17.800]   Wait, what?
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.360]   Was that what happened really with the announced app?
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.600]   Let me tell you something.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.600]   I'll be Leo.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.440]   I'm just saying as a person who is a man of people in these streets, I had many a non-tech
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.560]   people call me talk about, "Where can I go?
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:31.720]   How do I download my stuff to put it somewhere else?"
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.840]   For a lot of people who are making a living selling dudes and all that porn and only fans.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.240]   Again, they're at home by themselves doing whatever they want to do for themselves, which
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.240]   is great.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.240]   But they all want to download my stuff.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.160]   And by the way, you point out that they're not illegal.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160]   It is not illegal.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.320]   But this all started as you pointed out, Nicholas Christoff's, and we talked about this last
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:56.000]   week, "Peace in the New York Times, the Children of Pornhub," in which he accused them, and
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.680]   probably rightly so, of having exploitation, assault, rape, all sorts of horrific videos,
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.320]   non-consensual videos, revenge porn on there.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.520]   Pornhub's still doing business.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.240]   But what it did do is it scared the credit card companies.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.680]   And that's really what's happening here.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.440]   MasterCard and Visa, October 1st, new rules.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:22.440]   And I think completely, by the way, legit rules that you have to keep records of this
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.760]   and make sure this is all consensual.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.600]   Maybe it's a high bar for a company like OnlyFans.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:33.160]   Well, it's even less of a high bar for OnlyFans because OnlyFans, not for nothing, is more
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:36.760]   of an amateurish system where most people are...
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.200]   I can't say all, and I can't speak for everyone.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.440]   Most people are doing their own personal content.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:46.040]   You can see who this person is as opposed to porn, which is Hollywood, is produced.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.680]   It's, you know, you got staff, you got all these things production involved in it.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:52.040]   So it's harder to find out, like, what's real, where it's not?
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.360]   OnlyFans is like, these are...
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:58.280]   This is the mom and pop shop of porn, and you're just out here trying to take away this
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.280]   revenue.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.720]   And all they're going to do is go somewhere else.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.480]   There's other places to go to.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:07.880]   And OnlyFans tried to do what they wanted to do to make money, but people were leaving
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.080]   an exodus and they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.280]   Too much money.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.560]   And then some people are upset saying, well, why is it these bank business...
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.880]   You know, the credit card companies, these banks are deciding whether OnlyFans gets a
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:24.840]   credit card or whether OnlyFans gets to exist.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:29.280]   Now, Alex, you talked about this on your podcast equity.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:34.640]   So tell me what your take on this, because it was at the credit card companies, and then
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.200]   what happened for OnlyFans to reverse it?
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.640]   So we know most of that, not all of it.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.360]   So it wasn't just the fact that MasterCard and Visa were changing their rules and so forth.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.680]   There was also banking partners that were banks in the system that were not processing
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.240]   wire transfers for OnlyFans.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:55.680]   And so they were being frozen out, essentially, of the financial networks slowly, or maybe
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.040]   more quickly, to be my understanding, that we don't have the whole timeline in front
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.040]   of us.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.920]   Well, October 1st was a hard date, and that would have been a personal...
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:04.920]   Yes, that was a commercial card.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:06.920]   That would have been a problem, right?
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:07.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.920]   Right.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:09.920]   But I mean, the company also wanted to raise money.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.920]   I said...
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:11.920]   I'm sorry, I didn't mean the answer to raise a hard date.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.920]   Sorry, I didn't mean the answer to raise a hard date.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:13.920]   Sorry, I don't want to offend you.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.920]   I'm just here.
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:15.920]   I'm just here.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920]   Sorry, Alex.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.920]   Go ahead.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.960]   No, but a multifaceted problem, though, is by building over time.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:25.480]   I think OnlyFans didn't get a foul of various financial groups, because for a while they
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.480]   were smaller.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.480]   They became very big.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.080]   OnlyFans became a cultural force, it showed up in song lyrics.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.880]   I mean, it became part of society.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:36.400]   Well, and there are legitimate people, artists, recording artists over with using OnlyFans
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.400]   as well.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.400]   It's not only boring.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.400]   Sure.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400]   Absolutely.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.600]   And there was some unclarity in the rules that they announced regarding what was actually
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.600]   going to be banned, because it's new to the news.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.600]   It still had two dimensions.
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.240]   So it's that great line.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.440]   And then, of course, they said, "The first is going to make this change."
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.920]   And then the entire internet lost its mind on Moz.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:59.160]   I was very impressed with how much MyTuberter feed was just complaints, but OnlyFans for
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.360]   a while there.
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.360]   And then they flipped around.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.920]   And so my guess is they found a way to handle the banking side of this and also the regulatory
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.360]   side that's going to let them stay in business.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.640]   But OnlyFans has become an enormous company.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.800]   Like billions of dollars in revenue.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.600]   And it matters to the quote, quote, "creator economy," which is a wide net.
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.200]   It includes a lot of different types of content.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.200]   100s.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.880]   130 million registered users, 2 million creators.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:25.400]   I don't know what percentage of them are putting porn on there.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.720]   But I would say much more than half.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.320]   I go into 60%.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.320]   I go into 60/40.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.320]   That's being generous.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.320]   60/40.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:36.560]   And the pandemic was very, very good for OnlyFans.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:44.000]   The user base rose from less than 20 million to 130 million transactions, increased it 700%
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.440]   to 2.36 billion.
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.680]   A lot of lonely people can't go out.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.640]   Can't get, you know.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.320]   So a lot of people who were unemployed turned to it as a way to make money.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320]   That's true too.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.320]   Right.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.560]   OnlyFans is actually a better deal than Apple.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.120]   They only take 20%.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.120]   Yes.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.080]   So it's a good deal for the creators.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.080]   Right?
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.320]   I imagine the notes, Apple.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:12.760]   They must have also come up with a way to verify that these are consensual, that the participants
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:16.120]   are of age, all of that stuff, right?
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.920]   Because there is some illegal stuff you could be involved in.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.840]   Often porn sites are involved in.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.360]   That they would not want to be involved in.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.360]   So I imagine they figured out some way.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:26.560]   You think Alex to get around that?
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.880]   I think they have to find a way to be legit if they're going to try to keep adult content
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:31.880]   on the site.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.000]   Because otherwise, their entire business is going to get frozen out.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.960]   And then no one, even artists, can't take payments for the service.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.240]   So I'm still waiting to get the details of how their new banking system is going to
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:43.240]   work.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:47.560]   But when I think it was the Bank of New York Mellon, just won't send wire transfers anymore,
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:51.320]   you're starting to have serious kinks in the broader kind of financial framework that makes
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.320]   payments possible.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.680]   In an interview with Financial Times, they said, Bank of New York Mellon, Metro Bank,
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:04.440]   and JP Morgan Chase, those three big ones blocked intermediary payments.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:09.000]   So that meant the creators couldn't get their earnings.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.320]   At that point, you have to make a decision about what to do.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.160]   And if you don't see a way forward with keeping most adult content on the service, you have
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.760]   to cut off as much of it as you need to to stay alive.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.960]   What I'm really curious about is between that decision, which they must have made reluctantly,
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:28.040]   because they're making so much money from this, what changed in that couple of days
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.840]   in which they figured out what they needed to do to stay in the business that they have
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.960]   been in, who stepped up to help them?
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.960]   How do they figure this out?
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:39.520]   I don't know that yet, but I'm so curious what I'm not technical and financial and regulatory
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.160]   side was done.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:46.120]   So if you know, tell me, because my gosh, you can find out too now, because I want to
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.120]   know too.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:52.280]   But is a tweet from the company saying it had quote, "secured assurance is necessary
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:58.160]   to support our diverse creator community."
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:03.480]   So have we had statements from the bank saying that they will handle the transactions to
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:04.480]   the creators?
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.280]   Can you imagine JP Morgan Chase saying, "I feel like it's a problem."
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.280]   Yeah, there's no problem.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.280]   But how do we know they fixed it?
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.400]   I don't think that one's coming.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.080]   So they must have found, so maybe you know this financial system better than we do.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.280]   Alex, is there another way to go when he started taking Bitcoin?
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280]   We moved to Bitcoin.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.280]   We're going to digital now.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.640]   We're going to sell our digital art as ETH on all these bands.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:29.640]   NFTs.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.640]   NFTs.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:31.640]   NFTs.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:36.440]   Man, we got so far today before we brought it to NFT.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:37.840]   I've been here for two hours now.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:38.840]   It was the first NFT mentioned.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840]   We shall get a gold star.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.560]   No one said we got club yet.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:46.000]   We were trying to get past it, but we had to finance.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.360]   When it came to finance, you know.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.640]   No one said blockchain yet either.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.640]   Oh, wait, wait, Pinals about ten minutes.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.680]   Someone's winning a bingo.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:01.360]   I got to tell you, if anything's going to solve this conundrum, that's the perfect technology
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.360]   to do that, right?
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.360]   Blockchain.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.320]   It's anonymous, secure.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.320]   It's not.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.440]   A lot of blockchains aren't anonymous.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.920]   So there are certain chains that have more privacy built into them, like Monero compared
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.360]   to Bitcoin proper.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:18.600]   But I mean, I don't think there's enough people in the broader crypto economy that have access
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:24.880]   to cryptocurrency in a wallet to power an only fans-sized platform.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:28.440]   I think it's a great idea to speculate and play with and tinker with.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.480]   But I mean, it's not there yet.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:31.920]   Leo, credit cards work.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.480]   Only fans work because credit cards are ubiquitous.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.480]   So it's easy.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:44.240]   You know, and I kind of do feel bad for the creators who I think a lot of them felt empowered.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:51.640]   Well, again, people contacted me and said, "What do I do?"
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.640]   And I'm like, "I'm busy writing this."
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.200]   Because you're a technical guy, they said.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:56.200]   Yes, because they knew there were a lot of strippers.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.200]   So you're going to do that.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.720]   Yeah, I'm just saying, I do photography.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:01.360]   There's things that I know to people I know people would be doing.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.120]   Anyway, I said, "Don't worry about it.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.120]   There's always something else."
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.200]   You know, there's many fish in the sea.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:09.040]   Well, I think they're hard to do.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.040]   I'm sure this happened.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.880]   Loyal fans out there.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   If you're looking for a backup plan.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.640]   If you're looking for backup, loyal fans, same thing takes 20%.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.000]   There's like 12 other sites that offer the same service that charge anywhere between-
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.880]   And because they're under the radar, they get away with this at least for a while.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.880]   For now.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.960]   But the difference is too, that they charge different percentages.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:34.440]   Some places charge 10% up to 40%.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:38.880]   Other places do a set of like an OnlyFans, which is basically a Tumblr stream of your
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.880]   content.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.360]   They sell piecemeal things.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.360]   Where you sell videos or photos-
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.360]   Could you do this on Patreon?
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.520]   Don't people do this on Patreon?
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.920]   Yes, they do do on Patreon.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:52.400]   Again, the problem with Patreon and what this is, ease of use and ease for the creator
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.400]   to give out their content.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.400]   So if I'm a non-technical person, I go on OnlyFans.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.680]   Again, it's like Tumblr.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.680]   I just post my pictures of videos and it goes into a stream.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.160]   On Patreon, okay, now I've got a scheduled way to get you-
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160]   It's almost like you're on websites.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.760]   My things, I've got a host with the content somewhere.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.480]   At which point I might as well be doing my own pay portal and then paying someone to
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.480]   meet me at site.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:15.600]   So actually, there's multiple other places to go to, but this is part of OnlyFans.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.280]   This was actually a good platform.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.880]   Well, not only is it what they had to do, because again, I made up a number of 40%,
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.960]   but I'm telling you that people were jumping ship immediately because there are other places
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   to go to.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.960]   Well, and you're-
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:28.960]   You figured you had to-
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:33.680]   If you're paying your rent and putting food on the table, and all of a sudden, October 1st,
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:34.680]   you're not going to be able to.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:35.920]   You're going to find another alternative.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:40.480]   And again, literally the conversation is, okay, you find this backup site.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.000]   Now I've got 30 days to promote to the people that are already on board with me to transfer
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.400]   to this backup site and start giving them money.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.400]   And that's exactly what happened.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.400]   That's a lot.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.400]   OnlyFans isn't stupid.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.640]   They looked and must have saw advertising for another site or another site.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:57.760]   They're like, wow, people are already pushing because I've already got the fans, Leo.
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.800]   I've already got the community and they're here paying me.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:05.600]   So as you know, people that are willing to pay you are more fervent for your content.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.040]   So they will do what you ask them to do to keep getting said content.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.440]   So only fans did what they had to do next is live.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440]   No idea.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.120]   There was this much interest in flan.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:19.720]   I thought, you know, caramel flavored desserts weren't that huge.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:20.720]   It's a-
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.720]   This is America.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:22.720]   Okay.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.280]   There is a great Twitter account called OnlyFlans.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.600]   It's that tweets out pictures of flan.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.600]   And it's a-
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.600]   That's so wonderful.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:37.040]   There's a whole meme about this.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.040]   People are making jared it.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.040]   It is.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.280]   Yeah, but everyone tried to do derivatives.
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.040]   Like, you know, I'm going to open a seafood restaurant that only serves one type of food
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.360]   called OnlyClams.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.840]   You know, I mean, like people are trying to make all sorts of jokes.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.400]   But keep in mind, guys, like Tumblr banned adult content.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.400]   It was a hot mess.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.400]   Patreon has banned.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.120]   And you have to do artistic music.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.800]   By the way, they never really pretty much killed Tumblr.
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.000]   Have you heard of Tumblr since?
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   Absolutely not.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000]   And in Patreon has sold for a buck.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   It has a lot of 50 to WordPress.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   Right.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.160]   And then Patreon banned pornography and only allows artisticy nudes.
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:12.400]   So that's not going to be a fit for a lot of the OnlyFans creators.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:16.600]   And you know, if you have to go to whatever the other services that we're talking about,
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.760]   it's so hard to bring your paying community over.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.480]   It's like changing newsletter providers if you can't take your newsletter list.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:23.480]   You know, it's a real...
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.480]   Is this over now?
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.960]   Is this solved?
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.160]   Will these creators stay to the people that called you where they could say, "Oh, I don't
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.160]   have to move?"
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:35.200]   What I've suggested to people is it's free to start up an account for you anyway as a
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.200]   creator.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200]   Right.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   So start up a back-up page.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   Do you have a five?
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   Make the page.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.880]   And if again, if you have to switch, you have a month or two-month lead time to promote
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.000]   to try and get some people over and start going to something else.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.400]   I will tell you my favorite video of all time is like when kids mess with older family
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:53.640]   members, a younger girl was talking to her grandmother and she's like, "Grandma, do you
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.640]   have an only fan?"
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.520]   And she's like, "I can afford air conditioning.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.440]   I haven't had only fans since I was in grade school and it's the kids."
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.840]   She's like, "No only fans.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:05.840]   We use air conditioning."
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.800]   No, us Medicare folks.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.440]   We have very limited understanding of the smarter...
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.440]   We see nowadays.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.600]   No, no only fans.
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.600]   Good news.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:17.600]   Should we take a break or shoot?
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.600]   Let's take a break.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:24.680]   And then we'll give you some good news for people who wanted Windows 11 or is it?
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:25.680]   I showed it.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.120]   I brought to you by WordTune.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.120]   You know what?
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.720]   Writing is probably the most important.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.640]   I know I'm a speaker.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:40.600]   But really, if you want to get your ideas together and communicate, writing is huge.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:41.600]   Huge.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:45.400]   But bad writing is a problem.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:51.880]   Did you know every year, US businesses waste over $400 billion.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:57.120]   That's almost half a trillion dollars because of bad writing?
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:01.320]   It causes confusion and misses the market, takes too long to get to the point, and it
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:05.640]   may even bind you to something you didn't want to be bound to.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:10.360]   On the other hand, good writing helps businesses win and impress customers.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:13.760]   It enhances brand perception and improves internal communication.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:18.800]   It really is about communication, strengthens relationships with critical partners.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.800]   It's good for you too.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:26.400]   If you're a good, clear, effective writer, man, the world's your oyster.
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.840]   Better, faster writing means better business.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:33.360]   That's why your team needs WordTune for teams.
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.080]   Oh, this is brand new.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.080]   I'm excited.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.000]   I've been using WordTune for quite some time.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.480]   You can use it too by just going to WordTune.com.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:44.920]   You put in some pros, it'll give you a bunch of different ways to express it.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:49.000]   Even though I think I'm a pretty good writer and I like to write and I write a lot, every
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.280]   time I use WordTune I go, "Oh, that's great.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.280]   Oh, that's great.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.280]   Great idea."
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.160]   Then I integrate it in.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.920]   It goes way beyond simple spelling and grammar correction.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:02.520]   It's the only AI-powered writing tool that actually understands meaning and context and
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:03.600]   what you're trying to say.
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:08.200]   It gives you writing suggestions that help anyone achieve clear and compelling writing.
[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:11.760]   WordTune for teams does it for your team in business.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:20.360]   What a great idea, the ultimate writing tool, to evaluate your entire team's writing instantly.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.360]   I was blown away.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.520]   I actually thought, "Oh, no, I'm a great writer.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.520]   I'm not a writer.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.760]   I don't need WordTune."
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:31.320]   Then I was like, "Oh, plus you can say make this more formal, make this less formal, make
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:35.040]   it more casual, make it clearer, shorten it, expand it.
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.480]   It has all sorts of settings.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:38.720]   It's actually brilliant.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.040]   You really feel like you've got a writing coach.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.720]   When can your team use WordTune?
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:46.760]   WordTune enhances performance on any project.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.240]   Everything from internal emails.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:53.560]   Would it be nice if emails were clear, concise, and expressive?
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.560]   Press releases.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:57.400]   How many bad press releases have we read?
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:01.320]   Sales outreach to customer services support so much more.
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:05.800]   When you're writing to a customer with a support email, "Oh, it would be so nice if
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:10.240]   they're clearly written elegant, maybe a little more casual, maybe a little ... you
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.560]   get to choose.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.040]   You can use WordTune to tune up your words, right?
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.720]   Anywhere you're writing online.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:16.720]   I mean anywhere.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:20.280]   Google Docs Slack, Outlook Web, WhatsApp.
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:24.280]   WordTune improves writing efficiency up to four times.
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.920]   It's faster and better.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:30.440]   Get your team a discount when you go to WordTune.com/twit.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:36.360]   Give your team writing superpowers, W-O-R-D, T-U-N-E.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.080]   Like tune up your words like a piano.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.880]   WordTune.com/twit.
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:46.120]   I think this is an amazing, amazing tool.
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.760]   WordTune.com/twit.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:52.040]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.320]   We had a fun week this week on Twit.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:59.080]   In fact, I think we had Victor make us a little presentation for you.
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.080]   Watch.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:06.960]   We had an email that said, "Today only all mouse jiggles, 40% all."
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:08.280]   What's the ...
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:09.800]   Oh, look at all the ...
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:10.800]   What's the mouse?
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.800]   What do you would know?
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.800]   What's the mouse jiggler?
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:16.200]   I can't believe you bought this without knowing what it does.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.200]   Yes, it's just ...
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.640]   Wouldn't you spend $15 to have your own mouse jiggles?
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.360]   Far with LED readouts?
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.360]   Yes.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:26.440]   Previously on Twit, Tech News Weekly.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:32.880]   I got in my hands, or rather on my hand, the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.800]   This is Samsung's latest wearable.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.800]   Is that what you were?
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.520]   This is the first Android wearable that when my wife saw the box, since she said, "This
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:41.560]   is a pretty watch.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.560]   I want one."
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:46.560]   It's the first Android wearable that she's ever said that to.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.120]   iOS Today.
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:52.920]   On iOS Today, Matthew Keflmanli walks us through his core apps and then we're going to get
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:56.160]   deep into the weeds on shortcuts.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.160]   Hands on tech.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:00.920]   Unlike those jeeps of old, this is the Wrangler Unlimited.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.400]   If you're looking for something with the capability of a Jeep, the looks of a Jeep, you're going
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:07.680]   to have a hard time doing much better than this.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:12.440]   If you want something that is also a little more environmentally friendly than standard
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.440]   Jeep.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.440]   Twit.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.880]   It keeps going and going and going.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.840]   Almost 20 years I've known this guy.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.840]   Exactly.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.560]   We've been looking for the perfect useless gadget.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.920]   We've finally found it.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.240]   But we both found it because you didn't like the purse God and I still think that's one
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:30.400]   of the finest gadgets.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:35.960]   That's a little hook to put on the table to hold your purse and it's got an alarm.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.840]   If somebody steals your purse, he goes, "Woop, woop, woop."
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.760]   Yes, yes.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.680]   He still mocked it.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.800]   We never did find out what the mouse jiggly does, by the way.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:51.040]   That's why you know.
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.760]   Apparently it jiggles your mouse.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.760]   I know that's what he's been following.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.760]   What's it for?
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.760]   What's it for?
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.760]   It keeps your computer from falling asleep.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.760]   Oh.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.760]   Well, there's ways to do this.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.760]   Yes.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:04.760]   Yes.
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:09.920]   And if you work for a company that tracks your activity, you can have the mouse jiggly
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:10.920]   or wiggle your mouse.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:15.560]   You can go make lunch and it'll still tell the other computers that you're doing.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:16.560]   Oh.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.680]   It's the equivalent of recording a video that you could put on Zoom so that people think
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:21.680]   you're there.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.480]   See, I mean, I'm old school, so I just use only fans for that.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.520]   I just take a stick to the fan and put it on motion and I tie it to the mouse.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.520]   Oh, that guy!
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.520]   I'm a fan of return.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.520]   Okay.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.520]   Actually, flange jiggles pretty good too.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.520]   So I'm low budget over here with that.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.720]   I didn't know how to advise me goodbye.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:38.720]   Mouse jiggly.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.000]   That's actually probably what it's really for.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.400]   That makes a complete sense.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.040]   I'll be diggity danged.
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.960]   I don't think Dick and I figured that out.
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.920]   We don't have the larceny in our minds so much, you know?
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.320]   It required the geniuses of Twit.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.320]   There you go.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:56.840]   You guys are good.
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.880]   You guys are good.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:05.600]   By the way, I do want to mention that Dick's Gizfiz is seen every week on our live stream
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.000]   and then is available for download to club Twit members.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.720]   It's one of the many wonderful benefits of joining club Twit.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:17.440]   $7 a month gets you ad free versions of all our shows.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.080]   That's both video and audio.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.520]   So you never have to hear another ad including this one by the way.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.960]   You also get access to the Twit plus bonus content feed that includes the Gizfiz, the
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.720]   untitled Linux show, inside Twit.
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:32.600]   And well, we had a good conversation before the show began.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.360]   I think about massive donuts.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.360]   Yep.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.360]   Things like that.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.240]   All the stuff that happens before and after the show is it's a really good feed.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.400]   So that's, I think that's a pretty nice benefit.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:44.720]   Of course, the best benefit is knowing that you're keeping Twit going.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.360]   Oh, I forgot to mention the Discord.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.360]   There's a great Discord too.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.360]   A lot of fun.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.360]   Discord is super fun.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:55.080]   I had used Discord but I'd used it more like a Slack a little bit.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:01.080]   You know, I'm a member of, you know, Discord's programs I use or programming languages.
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.720]   But what are, I think it's the future of social networks.
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:09.080]   Well, I am, as they know, I am a chat man, warrior, I'm a man of the people.
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:13.640]   The best thing about Discord is that I can express myself with gifts and emojis.
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:14.640]   So sometimes.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:15.640]   Oh my God.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.640]   The animated gifts.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.280]   Sometimes the word just doesn't give you the right feeling as opposed to a cat.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.320]   With laser beam shooting out of its back flying across the moon.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.400]   Sometimes you need to feel that in a gift and you get to do that in a Discord.
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:28.400]   It is amazing.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:34.840]   And you may also see some behind the scenes shots like these from Lisa of the two Ant-Proits.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:35.840]   That's right.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.800]   I want to call myself Ant-Proit-Light.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:38.800]   Look at that.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.160]   I mean, I just look how big your head is here to Lisa's.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.960]   Look, look, I'm saying.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.280]   And imagine the donut was bigger than my head.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.680]   That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.600]   Lisa could go through the hole in the donut.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.840]   I'm trying to impress people how big that donut actually was.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:54.840]   Wow.
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:55.840]   It was a big donut.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:57.840]   Anyway, it is a lot of fun.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.760]   I hope you'll get the satisfaction to knowing your support and the network.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:04.600]   And yes, while we have ads, I would more and more.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:09.000]   I would love to see the support come from our listeners, people like you.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]   And thanks to all of you who are already clubbed to it.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.280]   Members, we really appreciate that.
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.280]   It helps a lot.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.240]   For more information, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:23.520]   As Joe says in the Discord, we are the benefit of club twit.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:25.720]   Yes, that's true.
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.200]   That's true.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.200]   Let's see.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.200]   We did only fans.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:31.360]   That was the hot subject.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.000]   Here's one that will be a little more geeky, but a little less sexy.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.800]   So remember, I have this theory.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.240]   Microsoft has this new version of Windows, Windows 11, which is exactly like a lot of
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:49.320]   Windows 10, except it got rounded corners on the Windows.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.880]   They're going to center the start menu.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:52.880]   It's prettier.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:53.880]   It's prettier.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:54.880]   It's prettier.
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:55.880]   And I know exactly.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:00.520]   I could see this conference room meeting where the executives are sitting around saying,
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.160]   "Well, yes, so sat you.
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:07.400]   We got the new version, Windows 11, Panos Panay, who is by the way now promoted to being on
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.080]   the executive committee.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:12.200]   Panos Panay says, "We're going to do this.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.760]   Is there anything new under the hood?"
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:15.880]   No, no, it's the same Windows, sat you.
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:17.520]   We got rounded.
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:20.600]   And sat you saying, "You know exactly what's going to happen.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.720]   People are going to come on Twitter and say, "I don't want that.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.720]   Give me some improvements.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:26.440]   I don't want rounded corners.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.440]   You're doing what?
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.360]   You're centering the start menu.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.360]   Are you nuts?
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:33.520]   Why would you do that?"
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:37.000]   And Panos says, "Well, we got this idea.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.920]   We'll tell them they can't have Windows 11.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:45.600]   They can't have it unless they have a brand new eighth generation or later Intel processor
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.080]   and they have a TPU.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.080]   You can't have it."
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:50.560]   And it changed the conversation.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.960]   Now everybody's saying, "I want Windows 11, but I can't have it.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:56.800]   I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore."
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.800]   So the conversation completely shifted.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.440]   No one said, "I don't want a centered start menu."
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.640]   You knew they were going to say that.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.640]   No one said that.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.760]   They said, "Why can't I have Windows?
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.280]   I have a mic if you're only three years old."
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.080]   And Satya said, "Yeah, but that's going to create some upset."
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.280]   "No, no, no.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.920]   Satya, Panos says, 'I got this.'
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:20.240]   Three months later, we'll announce you can all have Windows 11.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.000]   We changed our mind."
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.840]   And then we've dodged a bullet on the centered start menu.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:30.120]   Everybody's happy and that's exactly what happened this week.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.600]   The Microsoft had a briefing.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.640]   They didn't invite me.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.000]   Did they invite anybody here?
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000]   No.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.800]   I don't cover Microsoft anymore, but Leo, can I just say before you get into the importance
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:41.120]   to fear, that was a terrible Panos penance for sure.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.120]   I know Panos.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:46.880]   And I was more like, "I'm all pumped up about this Windows 11.
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:47.880]   I'm so pumped.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.720]   It's so great to drop a surface."
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:51.720]   I was laying for an office bump like this.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.720]   I was wondering.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.960]   All right, I mean, if it wasn't to an impression, I was more, it's a thought experiment.
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:40:59.960]   It's like the one man show.
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:00.960]   Leo does Microsoft.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.560]   I mean, I don't know what the hell that was, but it's very interesting.
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.720]   But that's just my theory is that they had this problem because they really Windows 11
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.240]   is garbage.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.400]   It's nothing.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   I want it.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.400]   Yes, you do.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.800]   Because you can't handle the 11.
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:17.200]   No, no, hear me out.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.200]   Hear me out.
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.880]   Windows 8 was an attempt to use something that didn't work, was to bring, you know, tablet
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.240]   and desktop together in one OS didn't work out.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.560]   All right, fair enough.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.080]   Windows 10, fantastic.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.080]   Big Windows 10 fan.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.080]   Use it every time a gaming machine.
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.080]   Love it.
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:32.080]   You don't need anything else.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.000]   It's a little like the start means kind of gross.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.360]   And you know, there's some things about it that I don't love.
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:41.400]   And it looks like Windows 11 is going to have the same like rock solid base of like security
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:42.400]   and it's not changing.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.400]   It works really well.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:48.640]   Well, it's one other thing, which is, is in a redesigned Microsoft store and they're
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:51.720]   going to have Android apps in there, which I don't think is going to get anybody going,
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.200]   oh, I got to have that.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.000]   I mean, I think it's a benefit.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.720]   It's a small benefit.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:00.280]   Android apps really look at this point.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.440]   If you're not stealing stuff from Apple and integrated into your system, you're behind
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:09.720]   on that respect as opposed to where Apple does things where the exact opposite, they
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:15.040]   give you the same thing for 19 years and then they're like, oh, we invented waterproof
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.040]   phones.
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.640]   Everybody's had a waterproof phone for the last five years.
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.000]   But when they do it, it's magical.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000]   Windows is the exact opposite.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.800]   Yeah, we we we're going to do some magical stuff in the future, but you you can't have
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:26.800]   it yet.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:29.120]   So when you get it, you'll find out how oh, the corners around it.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:30.120]   Okay.
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:31.120]   So aesthetically, it looks better.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.800]   I guarantee you all of the talk would have been about centered start menu.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:35.800]   Yes.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:36.800]   Why?
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:39.280]   And by the way, it's easy to put it back to the left, but that's like, what's the point?
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.280]   Why do you do that?
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.280]   That's just what it is.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:44.400]   That's just that you just mess it with my muscle memory now.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:49.720]   So Leo in in this later this year, I'm going to buy a new laptop.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:55.480]   My I've got a 24 T backbook pro and I'm not going to be able to run the next version
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:00.000]   of the Mac OS that I've been thinking about replacing it with a Windows machine, a game
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000]   Windows gaming machine.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:08.000]   And and I was kind of on the fence about it, but having seen Windows 11, I like the way
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000]   it looks so much.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.440]   Oh, maybe they're going after the Mac crowd.
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:14.440]   Yes.
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:15.440]   Well, it looks like a Mac.
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:17.240]   I mean, it's very similar.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:18.240]   No, that's true.
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:20.200]   Very similar.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.240]   And so I think it's I agree with Alex.
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:26.600]   I think it Windows 10 needed a facelift.
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:27.600]   They've done it.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.520]   They've done it in a way that I think probably Apple should do with Mac OS.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.400]   They talked about, you know, with Big Sur how how it was an overhaul, not really.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:40.360]   It's still kind of gray with buttons.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:46.880]   And and I think that, you know, Windows 11 is is a lot bolder in terms of like a facelift
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.840]   but it is a facelift.
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:52.040]   But for a user experience, that's good.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.680]   Yes, Dwight, you're right.
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.560]   But also it has better multi monitor support and it has some gaming steps to make games
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.720]   load a lot faster, which matters to me.
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:02.520]   And I think it has widgets, which I've wanted back since Vista.
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:05.280]   Oh boy, there's an improvement widgets are back.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:09.000]   Hey, hey, hey, you can talk all the trash you want, but I'm still going to be a happy,
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000]   happy boy.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.200]   When there's letters and I don't care, but any of y'all in there.
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:17.200]   So because this nerd and so other shoe drive this way to talk about widgets.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:19.040]   Okay, 42 net house.
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:20.040]   You're talking about.
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.040]   I just watched you age 10 years.
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:23.040]   I like my widgets.
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.040]   I think every computer should have widgets.
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.080]   So Leo, let me add Leo, let me add one more thing about this.
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:35.160]   You mentioned the Android apps and that nobody, you know, nobody's interested in that.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.680]   We had a surprise.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:41.360]   I helped that that weather site that he's been with the site that I mentioned space city
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.360]   weather earlier.
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.800]   Yeah, I helped them develop an app.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:50.160]   Their users had wanted an app so they asked me to project manage it and we put it out.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:56.320]   And it came out just a little bit after the M1 Max landed.
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:01.200]   And one of the things we discovered in looking at the analytics after it launched is that
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:04.920]   there are a huge number of people running this iOS app.
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.080]   It doesn't work on it.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.520]   It doesn't look good on an iPad.
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.760]   It's not a sign for an iPad on their M1 Max.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:14.560]   It gets a lot of launches on it, which kind of amazed me.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:18.160]   I thought nobody was doing that, but it gets used there.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:26.760]   And I suspect that the Android launch on Android capabilities on Windows 11 may actually be
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:28.720]   more valuable than people realize.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.120]   All right.
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.120]   You wait and see.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.120]   We'll talk next year.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:36.560]   See how many Android apps you've installed on your Windows 11 and 6.
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:43.080]   Because if you have an Android phone and you've got apps that you love and you can't really
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:47.120]   find the equivalent of when that be, besides this weather, this Houston.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.120]   I don't know.
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.120]   I'm an iOS user.
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.120]   But I mean, that's in so for.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:57.120]   But they also guys look like they all look like they're on a phone.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.480]   It's not you're not going to want them.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.480]   Trust me.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.480]   Okay.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:03.200]   To be clear, though, do we all think that the work that Microsoft has done to bring Linux
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.960]   and Windows a little bit more close together is pretty cool.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.800]   Yeah, but you still get that with Windows 10.
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:09.800]   Carry out though.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.080]   What's the news that doesn't mean that making the OS generally speaking, more open to more
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:15.680]   technologies is a bad thing.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:16.680]   Okay.
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:17.680]   And sure, you know what?
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:20.080]   I'm not looking forward to using Android apps because I happen to also be as Dwight
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:22.440]   is and apparently everyone else here and IOS user.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.520]   Well, but I love the idea of extending the platform to be more open.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.760]   This is an emulator.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.000]   It's so it's going to lots of stuff isn't going to work.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.320]   The stuff that works may not work well.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.520]   It's trust me.
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:34.760]   You're not going to.
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.800]   No, I mean, but I mean for for some folks, it's going to be fantastic because some folks
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.800]   will want it.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:44.320]   And I think generally speaking, having a more open platform is how Microsoft wins long term
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.320]   and less.
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:49.720]   It's different on the Mac because essentially the modern Macs are iPhones.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.440]   Yes, they are iPads.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:56.880]   So it's not a stretch to put an iPad app on a Mac because it's the same.
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:02.800]   So really what's happening is Apple's turning its Macs into iPhones and iPads.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.520]   So the wrong direction.
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:05.880]   I use Macs for work.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.160]   I need a solid desktop environment.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:12.600]   I think Microsoft is anyway, all of this was a long way around to tell you that you can
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:16.400]   now put Windows 10 11 on older PCs.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.400]   Congratulations.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.200]   It's my last time load.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:23.360]   Evil, evil strategy has come full circle.
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.880]   It's my windows and I want it now.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:27.960]   So they brought brief Tom Warren.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:28.960]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:33.080]   It's a little bit funky because you can't do it in the upgrade.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.680]   There will be a Windows 10 and Windows 11 upgrade through Windows update.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.320]   That will only work with 8th generation Intel plus TPU.
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:45.920]   But if you have an older machine that is quote, not compatible and this was the part of the
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.480]   problem was what do you mean not compatible?
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:50.360]   It's going to run perfectly well.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.100]   It's an arbitrary distinction that Microsoft just said, well, no, it's not going to run
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.100]   on these older machines.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:59.600]   Well, now in fact, we know it is because you'll download an ISO of Windows 11 and you can
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.200]   install it manually and it should work.
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:05.920]   It's not going to say you can't install it.
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:09.920]   Now, there is a big question mark.
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:13.400]   They didn't mention this during the briefing, but Tom Warren says after we published this
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:19.280]   post, Microsoft reached out to tell us the systems that are upgraded this way may not
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.520]   be entitled to get Windows updates, even security updates, which would make it really not a
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.520]   good choice.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:33.280]   No, you'd have to do a new ISO install each time there was a major.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.280]   I don't know.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:39.720]   I think this is all in flux and when Windows 11 comes out, most people will do as Windows
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.680]   users who have done since time memorial, get the new version of Windows with a new computer.
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:44.680]   Yes.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:46.680]   That's what people do.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.280]   Here's the problem with this entire conversation that we're having.
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:51.200]   My poor invitation of Panos Panay.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.200]   I know.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:54.160]   No, no, no, no, no, that was actually, that was hilarious.
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:57.240]   I was glad Mike, I didn't do it because Microsoft would call me and be like, what the hell
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.240]   was that?
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.560]   And I'm glad you can text Owen.
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.360]   Just don't call me.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:07.280]   All OS's that I use seem to have ossified.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:09.080]   They have stopped really evolving.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:10.400]   And think about your iPhone.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:14.800]   It's the exact same grid of apps and the phone, the camera's gotten better, but it still is
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.040]   not very good at phone calls and it's really great at Twitter.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.920]   That's the same phone I've had for like 10 years of that.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:19.920]   That's fine.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:20.920]   It's good.
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:24.720]   You know, Windows is trying to find a way to be more open and retain its Windowsness.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:27.600]   I just, I'm not that mad about it, frankly.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.480]   You know, and I love it.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:30.960]   They're putting Linux on it.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:36.680]   But I really think that you want Linux, not Windows personally, but it's just my bias.
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:38.760]   The average consumer does not want Linux.
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.920]   They want a pretty Windows like, and they're fighting against pretty Macs.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:45.480]   Average consumer should not be buying Windows.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:52.360]   I can't tell you how many calls I get to the radio show from people who say, I got a call
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:58.040]   today, wonderful, lovely woman, an older woman, probably my age.
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:04.680]   I keep getting this pop up from Maccafee saying, I need to renew my subscription, but I don't
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:05.680]   have Maccafee.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:08.720]   How do I get rid of that?
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:14.040]   And half an hour later, I still haven't really explained to her how to get rid of it.
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:19.000]   You make me mad because, yes, there's, maybe there's a cut off for age, but in change,
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000]   it's normal.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.440]   Because most people need power and freedom and not be walled into this apple.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.160]   As I'm using apple device, I'm going to close this thing.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.760]   I'm not recommending a Mac either.
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:32.520]   I would suggest a Chromebook or an iPad.
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:33.520]   And then if you-
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:34.520]   A Chromebook?
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.520]   Yes.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:36.520]   What do you-
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:37.520]   I own a Chromebook.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.080]   They're fine for browsing, but you can't do anything with them.
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:40.760]   They're lovely, but I call it a Cauch-
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.760]   A Crouty-
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.760]   What do you want to do?
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760]   What are you designing, rocket ships?
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:46.240]   A Chromebook is like using a weed wacker to cut your grass.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.600]   Oh yeah, you can get the job done, but I mean, I'd rather have a lawnmower.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.240]   Like, what are we going to do it?
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:54.240]   I'm going to back up this apple thing as I yell at my friends.
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:56.600]   Look, again, I'm not a perfect person.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:59.080]   As that as you're traveling, you didn't want to bring a big computer with it.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:01.920]   No, this is because I'm an America citizen, which makes me a trash panda.
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:06.280]   I fully understand what's wrong with apple, but there is a great consumer-
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:08.760]   Like, Leah, all she does is play all these games.
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.120]   All her friends need PCs.
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:12.040]   They're not gaming on Macs.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.440]   That's not the life that they're living.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:15.080]   You can't live a life like that.
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:16.080]   So there's a whole ecosystem-
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.080]   Yeah, all right.
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:18.080]   If you're-
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.080]   I agree.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:21.880]   If you want to play the latest Skyrim or Cyberpunk 27-
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:22.880]   Or if you want to process-
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:23.880]   Get a Windows machine.
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:26.960]   You don't want to spend a billion dollars doing that either.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.520]   What are you talking about?
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.520]   My phone's from everybody's process.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.240]   Have you not looked at YouTube and all the fans?
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.240]   Everybody's got fork and all the-
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:34.760]   And this is all enthusiast stuff.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:37.240]   And I think any enthusiast should get any operating system they want.
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:38.480]   I don't disagree with you.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:43.640]   I'm saying normal people who want to do some banking, check their email, and shop at Amazon.
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:44.640]   They don't need-
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.640]   If you have an age of 55, why are you doing this?
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:52.480]   If you're 25, if you're 25, you're not doing anything that you need a Windows machine for.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:55.720]   It's been a long day since you've been 25.
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.720]   They need things, Uncle Leo.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:58.720]   They need things.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:51:59.720]   Alex, tell them.
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:00.720]   Tell them to 25.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:01.720]   You're the closest one to it, Alex.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.560]   Tell them what the young kids need.
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:08.600]   First of all, I don't entirely endorse the distance that just happened because that was
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:09.600]   brutal.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:15.160]   But I will say, Leo, I think that the thing that you're missing slightly is that the Gen-Z
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:16.960]   folks are incredibly creative.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:17.960]   They make stuff.
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:18.960]   And I think-
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:19.960]   That's so creative.
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.840]   But I mean, honestly, maybe an iPad would be a better case.
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:22.840]   We are all creative.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:23.840]   Absolutely not.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:24.840]   We are all creative.
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.480]   But a lot of funny things.
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:28.200]   Make it on their phone.
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:29.200]   You know, but a lot of-
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.440]   All of TikTok stuff is done on the phone.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.080]   It's not done on a computer.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:38.120]   My son has 6.6 million views of his last TikTok video, and he does it on his phone
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:40.480]   and his Mac, but he uses Final Cut, but still.
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:45.400]   So he needs a desktop environment that you cannot have on a Chromebook.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:46.400]   Yeah, but how many-
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:47.400]   I mean, is that everybody?
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:48.400]   Chromebook is worthless.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:49.400]   Chromebook is worthless.
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:50.400]   Chromebook is worthless.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:51.400]   Chromebook is worthless.
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:53.840]   This is a spiciest conversation I've ever been in.
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:54.840]   Wow.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:55.840]   Great.
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:56.840]   Just get a Chromebook.
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:57.840]   What do you need to do?
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:58.840]   Go to ayole.com.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:52:59.840]   What do you-
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:00.840]   What do you want to do?
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:01.840]   You're doing that.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.840]   They're getting email.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:03.840]   They're surfing the net.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:04.840]   They're doing their banking.
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:05.840]   They're safe.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:08.480]   They're pictures and their laptop explodes.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.480]   People-
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.480]   Oh, my God.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:11.480]   But here's the saying-
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:12.480]   Oh, you got to call Jack.
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:13.480]   I used to work for AOL.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:15.360]   I used to work for AOL.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.760]   And I'm about to work for Yahoo's.
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:17.760]   So peace, man.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:18.760]   That's me.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.760]   No, P.T. is Yahoo.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.120]   Look, look, look, look.
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.920]   The people buying you were Yahoo?
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.920]   No, no, no.
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:25.920]   Apollo is Yahoo?
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:31.440]   No, Apollo is buying Verizon Media Group, which is a rebrand of OHS, which was the combination
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:33.480]   of Yahoo's carcass in AOL.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:35.040]   And they're rebranding the new thing.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:36.040]   But your Yahoo again.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.360]   But TechCrunch will not be Yahoo.
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:39.400]   Oh, they're calling it Yahoo.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:40.400]   Yes.
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:44.800]   So I will be working for a subsidiary of Yahoo, which will be a subsidiary of private
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.800]   equity.
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:46.800]   Wow.
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:47.800]   But that's great.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:50.080]   The problem with the Chromebook, right?
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:52.080]   The problem with the Chromebook.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.440]   Hey, so here's the problem with the Chromebook.
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:56.680]   The problem with the Chromebook is yes, you can do email.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:58.520]   Yes, you can use Twitter.
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:01.480]   Yes, you can do all these very basic things.
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:06.080]   But at any point, if you make the choice to do more, the answer is no.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.080]   No.
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:10.000]   And you don't want to hear no.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.280]   You don't want to hear no if you want to learn or learn how to do Photoshop.
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:18.160]   You don't want to hear no if you want to do Final Cut or Premiere.
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:24.440]   You don't want to hear no if you want to play the latest Far Cry on computer instead
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.700]   of a console.
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:27.080]   You don't want to hear no.
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:29.000]   A Chromebook tells you no.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.600]   And that's why you don't want a Chromebook.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:32.520]   I just want to make a collage book.
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:34.520]   And I can't put more to 15 pictures.
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:36.000]   You can totally do it.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.480]   You just, you guys just can't figure it out.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.480]   That's all.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:41.520]   You can totally do everything you want to do.
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:44.240]   I could call it a tech guy and get it figured out a lot more secure.
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.320]   It's a lot safer.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:53.800]   And I, people, you don't understand the pain people are suffering on using Windows for
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:59.080]   the next, other than your Apple shows that you have to do, for the next 30 days, I do
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:00.480]   a window show too.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:04.960]   For the next 30 days, you must do every single show, every piece of living on a Chromebook.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:05.960]   30 days.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:06.960]   Oh, no, not me.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:07.960]   But I'm talking.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:14.960]   I'm not crazy.
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:22.960]   I'm not crazy.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.960]   I'm just saying, I'm just told you what to get now.
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:26.960]   You get a Windows machine.
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:28.960]   I'm not nuts.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:29.960]   Exactly.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:30.960]   All right.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:31.960]   I own a Chromebook.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:32.960]   I love it.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.480]   Chromebooks are great couch laptops.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:36.520]   If you don't want to use an iPad, I'd have a keyboard.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:38.960]   But if I want to watch YouTube on the couch, it's great.
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:39.960]   But that's all it is.
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:42.360]   It's merely for lightweight consumption.
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:43.360]   That's not a computer.
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:45.360]   I don't think a lot of students are going to school.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.360]   It is a computer.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:48.440]   It's just not a very capable one.
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.440]   Find right.
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.440]   I'll allow that.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:53.600]   We can speak and move on now, but I'm glad we had a very enlightening conversation.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:55.160]   It should be changed a lot of minds.
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:57.040]   All three of us are going to get into a Chromebook.
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:58.880]   We're all going to get text messages.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:00.520]   No, they don't care.
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:03.680]   They're selling them like they sell them like those no tomorrow.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:05.320]   I don't care what you guys say.
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:09.320]   All the schools for in-school learning, that was what they dished out to everyone because
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:11.320]   it had a webcam and it didn't do so.
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.320]   If IT does not want to--
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.800]   Because IT does not want to support 1,000 Windows machines.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:17.800]   They're terrified.
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:18.800]   I don't blame them.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.800]   Only if they're running Windows 8.1.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:21.800]   Where's--
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:22.800]   I can't--
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:23.800]   I can't--
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:24.800]   I'm not playing choice.
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:25.800]   Where's Lisa with the black card?
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:26.800]   What do we need to do?
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:27.800]   I am not making the--
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:28.800]   What do we do?
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:29.800]   --the end of the year.
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:30.800]   --use 8.1.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:31.800]   That's not my choice.
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:33.440]   What are we doing here, folks?
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:34.440]   What are we doing?
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:35.680]   So today, let's take a break.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:39.240]   Our show today brought to you by Zipper Cruder.
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:41.320]   I am very happy if you are hiring.
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:42.320]   I thank you.
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:43.320]   God bless you.
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:46.400]   Actually, I see nothing but help wanted signs all over the place these days.
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:50.080]   That is the worst way, by the way, to hire for a job.
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:55.120]   You're hoping that the perfect employee is going to walk by, see your sign and apply.
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.160]   When you could go to Zipper Cruder--
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:58.400]   Amazing.
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:03.160]   You could go to Zipper Cruder, post in a minute to 100 different jobs sites because
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:08.080]   one post in Zipper Cruder goes to 100 plus job sites, social media like Facebook and
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:09.080]   Twitter.
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:13.400]   It gets your ad out there to everybody.
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:19.680]   That means you're more likely to reach that one person who's going to be the perfect employee.
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:22.080]   According to Forbes, nail salons are hiring.
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:23.080]   Gyms are hiring.
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:28.360]   Moms and pop stories are all set to go on an epic hiring spree in the coming months because
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:30.640]   they're opening and there's huge pent-up demand.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:33.280]   I cannot wait to get my toenails done.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:35.280]   I know you feel the same way.
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:36.280]   All righty.
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.000]   Oh, look, you got green.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.800]   Did you go to Manny Petty?
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.800]   I took the kid to get a nail salons.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:43.800]   See?
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:44.800]   People are dying.
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:45.800]   They're dying to get that Manny Petty.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:46.800]   Got to get it done.
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:49.880]   And there's a shortage, but not with Zipper Cruder.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:54.360]   You can get that job filled faster than you can imagine.
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:56.600]   Millions of jobs are suddenly opened up.
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:58.600]   Where do businesses go to fill these roles?
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:00.080]   Zip recruiter.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:07.040]   And you, you lucky person because you're listening, you can try it for free right now, zippercruder.com/twit.
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.800]   There's another thing Zipper Cruder does that a sign in the window won't do.
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:16.040]   Zipper Cruder's matching technology scans resumes across its network of millions of
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.360]   job seekers.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:22.920]   It will say, oh, this person's qualified for your open role, proactively presents them
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.400]   to you.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:27.240]   You can review the recommended candidates and you say, that one's good.
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:28.840]   You can invite them to apply for the job.
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:30.240]   You say, that one's no good.
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.240]   No foul.
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.240]   No harm, no foul.
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:33.760]   You just put it aside.
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:37.440]   But this encourages them to apply faster because they heard from you.
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:41.600]   And according to Zipper Cruder internal data, jobs where employers invite candidates to
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:46.680]   apply get two and a half times more candidates.
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:51.680]   It's so effective that four out of five employers who post on Zipper Cruder get a quality candidate
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:52.680]   within the first day.
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:56.240]   Actually, we use it and it's usually an hour or two.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.440]   And I always love it because Lisa's always skeptical.
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:01.680]   She's, oh, no, I got to fill another post.
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:04.760]   Oh, no, I don't want to have to do it.
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:07.160]   I said, Lisa, just Zipper Cruder.
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:11.040]   And within an hour, she's going, oh, look, there's a great candidate.
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:12.840]   Oh, there's another great candidate.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.440]   It's amazing.

[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:31.760]   Hire this guy, okay?
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:32.760]   Somebody.
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:33.760]   Hire this guy.
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:34.960]   I'll tell you when the posting goes up.
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:35.960]   I appreciate it.
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.960]   You can see if they recommend you to us.
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:38.960]   They probably won't.
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:40.800]   Alex's Vatchin' for me, so I'm good to go.
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:41.800]   Oh, good.
[01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:43.880]   All right, let's see.
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:44.880]   Did we get everything?
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:45.880]   Let me see.
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:46.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:47.880]   There's more.
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:48.880]   Are you finally doing Twit after Dark?
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:50.640]   No, he's making it up.
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:51.640]   He's trying to make it up.
[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:54.640]   Oh, well, did we talk about that years ago on the show?
[01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:56.480]   Oh, I talked about a lot of stuff.
[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:57.480]   Here's the thing.
[01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:00.160]   I'm here to talk to the boss today, so I'm going to make it happen.
[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.360]   Oh, you're going to talk to Lisa.
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.440]   I'm talking to the boss.
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.080]   Black cards, Twit after Dark.
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.080]   Twit after Black cards.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:07.200]   We're going to figure it all out.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:10.200]   I've realized for a long time I've been talking to the wrong person.
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:12.520]   I'm talking on the show hanging out with this guy.
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:13.520]   I just know power, right?
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:14.520]   I don't know.
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:18.200]   I don't know what I've been doing the way it's the best time over here.
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:19.200]   Hey, what do you say?
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:21.000]   I see you wrote an article about this, Alex.
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.600]   What do you think about?
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:26.440]   It's so interesting to watch companies that we're saying come back to work saying,
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:28.080]   whoa, hold on.
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:35.640]   Apple's now saying, yeah, probably next year, but we'll let you know.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:42.520]   I wonder if there's a new future where people are working remotely in almost every case.
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:43.520]   What do you think?
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:44.520]   Yeah.
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:45.520]   I think that is the case.
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:49.800]   I mean, so I talked to a lot of early stage technology startups, companies with two, three,
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:51.440]   five, seven employees.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:55.400]   And in the last 18 months, they've all become essentially default remote.
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:58.480]   They have a couple of people in CityX, they have a couple of people country Y, and they
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:00.000]   just kind of hired where they can.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.960]   It's a hard talent market, and folks are online everywhere.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:06.680]   And so to me, these big companies that are thinking they're going to be able to just
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:10.840]   command everyone to start commuting again and living in certain areas are kind of insane,
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:14.360]   because those same employees have more job opportunities than ever.
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:18.080]   And if they're in demand at the company, at the big tech company, they can get a job
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.080]   anywhere.
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:22.800]   And so I think it's a losing battle to say that you have to go to an office.
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:26.400]   And I think especially for smaller companies that are raising capital out there, selling
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:30.400]   shares to raise money to build their stuff, why would they spend that on rent?
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:31.960]   It seems very archaic to me.
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:33.960]   Here's another data point.
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:40.080]   Housing prices in this area, which is an attractive outside of the city area, have gone through
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:45.480]   the roof because I think a lot of people who work in San Francisco are saying, "I don't
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:46.720]   have to be here.
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:52.320]   I can live in Petaluma or Marin or Sonoma or Napa."
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:58.680]   Well, to what Alex just said, the basic point too is the larger companies, I'm in a 12-year
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:01:59.680]   lease, Leo.
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:05.040]   I can't just not have people in this office because I'm a big company and I'm paying
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:06.200]   these leases.
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:07.200]   Smaller companies, yes.
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:08.200]   They can transfer.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:09.680]   They're already nimble and yeah, yeah.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:12.200]   So for smaller companies, say, "Okay, will you figure this out?
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.200]   This is working for us."
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:14.600]   I think you're always money on rent.
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:18.720]   But for your larger businesses and companies, it's not like a one week or one month, they're
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:19.720]   not paying month to month.
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:21.840]   They're doing 10-year blocks.
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:22.840]   That's a bad reason.
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:24.840]   But I'm saying that is one reason why it's all being--
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:25.840]   I think there's also--
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:29.440]   I think they're saying come back because they're saying that money, they're just wasting.
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:35.920]   I think there's also this kind of industrial age conception of the workplace that is completely
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:38.120]   outmoded now.
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:42.520]   We got an assembly line and you have to sit there and you have to put widget A in socket
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:44.000]   B.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:50.360]   And even if you're an information worker, you're still acting as if you're on the assembly
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:51.360]   line.
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:52.360]   And you're not going to have 10 meetings a day.
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:53.360]   What are we doing?
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:54.360]   Exactly.
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.360]   And I think it's bad for work.
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:58.480]   I think it's bad for employees.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:05.000]   But bosses, and as a boss, I kind of understand this, we want to look at our guys working.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.080]   We want to know that they're doing something.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:08.520]   And so this is very antiquated.
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:11.720]   This is industrial era thinking, not information age.
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:15.640]   I mean, I can't speak for myself, but as Aunt Pruitt, I can say that I've been doing
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:17.800]   a lot of side fun at home.
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:19.520]   I'm on the dime, Uncle Lee.
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:20.520]   I'm just saying.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:25.160]   But did I mention that only fans has 700% increase in the pandemic?
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:26.160]   I'm just saying.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.960]   Did I mention a lot of people working home?
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.600]   What else are you going to say, Alex?
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:34.040]   Oh, no, no, I'm just thinking about the workspace and getting stuff done.
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:35.040]   And all that.
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.800]   I used to live half in Providence and half in San Francisco.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:38.800]   And I was on the team.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:39.800]   Oh, I remember that.
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:40.800]   Yeah.
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:41.800]   Yeah, yeah, for years.
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:45.680]   And so I literally lived the working in the office and then working at home dynamic.
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:49.640]   And it's amazing how much more I've got done at home because I wasn't walking to a bus
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:54.080]   stop taking a bus downtown in SF, going into an office, making coffee, talking to a couple
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:55.760]   of colleagues, then getting started.
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:58.760]   I just walked to my desk and I start work earlier now.
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:01.880]   I've never actually never worked more than during the pandemic.
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:03.040]   And I've never been so productive.
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:08.000]   And so to me, like the argument that bosses need you physically to look at you is silly
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.560]   because they didn't in any ways when I was in the office.
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.200]   All it did was make my life worse.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:16.200]   And because we don't have offices in our office, we just have rows of desks.
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:17.800]   It's a miserable place to be.
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.640]   And so I'm annoyed it took a pandemic for us to realize that we didn't have to do this,
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:23.720]   but here we are.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:27.520]   And I think if you look at the young tech companies, they show you the future of management to
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:30.040]   some degree, Google did back in the day.
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:32.320]   And I think we're going to a remote first world.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:33.320]   What about?
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:36.880]   I'm trying to think of what the negatives are because there is a benefit to being in
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:41.160]   the same room and kind of look how we are jamming together, you and me, Owen, because
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:42.360]   we're in the same room, right?
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.440]   It makes a difference.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:49.560]   So Leo, in one of the things that's happening also is that larger companies recognize that
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:51.840]   Alex is right.
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:56.680]   And while some of them are saying, you know, we want to back in the office, a lot of them
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:02.520]   are kind of preparing for like a hybrid type of work set up.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:08.880]   HPE, which is has moved its headquarters to Houston.
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:14.160]   And before that was in the process of building a new building, had altered the inside of
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:19.640]   the building to emphasize collaboration versus coming in and working all the time.
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:25.040]   And so as a result of the pandemic, they've created a workspace that people want to come
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:27.680]   to when they need to be together.
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:32.080]   But it also has the infrastructure to support remote work well.
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:38.200]   And so, you know, companies like HPE, which is a tech company, have been smart about it.
[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:42.360]   And I suspect over time, other companies will do the same thing because ultimately, Alex
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:43.360]   is right.
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:46.280]   Well, and we should also say there is no one size fits all either.
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:47.760]   There are some jobs here.
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.120]   For instance, engineers have to come here.
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:53.080]   They have to do physical things.
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:58.280]   There are some employees who want to work in the on premises because they miss the social
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:05:59.280]   environment.
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:01.880]   So is it possible to have a hybrid hybrid works?
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:05.080]   Alex, do you have kids trying to right now?
[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:06.080]   Don't have them yet.
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:08.080]   Miles will tell us, get that going.
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:09.080]   Kids are great.
[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:10.080]   Really?
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:11.080]   That's exciting.
[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:12.080]   Congratulations.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:13.080]   It's really cool.
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:14.080]   I mean, I've been married for a little bit.
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:15.080]   We want to have kids now is a good time.
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:18.080]   So you're actually having sex breaking for the first time in my life.
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:20.080]   I'm glad I had to be a strong thanks.
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.080]   So happy.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:22.080]   That's why the haircut.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:23.080]   That's why you cut it here.
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:26.520]   To finish my point, first of all, if you have a son, Owen's a great name for your son.
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:28.520]   I suggest that one to you.
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.720]   Secondly, I just was not Omar.
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:32.720]   I was just not Omar.
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:36.960]   I was just visiting my friend who works for Lockheed and Martin.
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:40.720]   And his son is four and his daughter is one.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:43.600]   And I asked him, I said, "Where's your dad?"
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:45.720]   He's like, "He's either in his office or the bathroom."
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:48.720]   That's where he works from all this time.
[02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:51.520]   So he only goes to the office one day.
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:52.520]   I was cracking.
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:57.080]   I was like, and the mom, she's like literally like, "If you can't see him, he's in the office
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:58.080]   or the bathroom."
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:00.920]   I said, "Well, the kid, you know, I don't know how to mow the baby."
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:03.160]   That's a babes truth.
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:07.720]   And for him, and Lockheed Martin, he still has to travel the world for certain things,
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.080]   for his part of his job.
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:12.160]   But just he enjoys so much being around the kids and being home full of kids.
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:13.160]   Oh, it's great for a father.
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:16.320]   And just because he's usually in the situation where the kids too.
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:17.320]   And it is.
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:22.800]   And the problem I have in my mind is that it's also spoiling the kids for when he has to
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:23.800]   go back.
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:25.240]   Because I've always lived a fluent lifestyle.
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:27.440]   I've been able to pick my kid up every day after school.
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:29.920]   I coach all her sports and stuff.
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:30.920]   So just being a president.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.920]   You're a president, by the way.
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:34.480]   You could tell when you see Alia.
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:35.480]   I appreciate it.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:36.480]   She's just great.
[02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:39.400]   I only got one real job and I was doing that for her.
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:43.880]   But it does make a difference as opposed to her friends whose dads can't ever even come
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:45.720]   to a game or practice.
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:46.720]   And it does.
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:51.640]   So being a parent of mother or father and being in the household and getting things done
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:56.280]   and still being in the general area in case there's a family need or emergency is great.
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:58.640]   And a hybrid situation will be the best.
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:02.200]   It seems to visualize because it is great seeing you.
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:04.160]   I've been talking to Ant for years.
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:07.280]   Yeah, first time you met first time we've ever met.
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:08.280]   We call each other two o'clock.
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:10.280]   That explains why I've never seen the two of you.
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:11.280]   Yeah, same time.
[02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:13.680]   I mean, you know, I mean, we we spoke to black caucus.
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:17.240]   We weren't allowed to join forces at the same time till now.
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:21.120]   But I mean, I've talked to him so much like I feel like I know him and that's great and
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:22.920]   his virtual and all the visual thing.
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:23.920]   Well, that's another thing.
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:24.920]   This thing.
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:25.920]   This change presence makes a difference.
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:30.840]   You have technologies that for the first time ever make it possible for this to get done.
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:31.840]   Yes.
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:33.680]   I mean, this is something relatively new.
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:38.080]   Whenever my daughter gets down, I remind her I had to ride my bike 12 miles to see a
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:39.320]   girlfriend when I was down.
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:41.240]   I couldn't call and face time.
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:42.440]   I couldn't see anybody.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.120]   And even on phone, we had regular fun.
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:46.240]   I had to wait to some of the vine wasn't busy.
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:47.240]   You know what I mean?
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:50.240]   Like, so you live in a world where you can actually see your friends get into little group
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:51.240]   things.
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:52.240]   They're playing games together.
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:53.240]   They're streaming.
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:55.880]   So even though there's got to be some downside.
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:57.880]   What is the downside to this?
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:08:58.880]   Ah, mentorship.
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:08:59.880]   To some degree.
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:00.880]   Mentorability.
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:06.920]   What's going to happen to cities, which really, I mean commercial real estate is going to
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:07.920]   collapse.
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:08.920]   Yeah.
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:13.520]   By the way, airlines, you talk about business travel, but we already are seeing business
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:17.520]   travel die because companies realize we don't need to spend the money to do this.
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:18.520]   We've got Zoom.
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:22.360]   So actually, Leo, that's not very not where you and I thought it was going to.
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:25.240]   I was talking to the CEO of a travel technology company.
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:27.480]   I forget if it was Trevago or someone else.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:29.640]   But I was like, you know, what's going to happen to business travel when we're all
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:31.000]   remotely, don't go anywhere.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.400]   And he was like, well, actually, it turns out that companies that do go remote are flying
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:38.080]   their employees out for two to three times a year kind of get together is to do this in
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.080]   person stuff.
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:43.080]   And so this person, the CEO act just forget who it was.
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:44.840]   Actually was kind of bullish on the future of business travel.
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:48.800]   So there's another side to that argument that I didn't initially foresee.
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:49.800]   Yeah.
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:54.720]   But you know, getting 100 employees to fly to Hawaii for a treat once or twice a year
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:59.120]   is not the same as sending your salesperson out five days a week.
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:07.520]   And I have to tell you, airlines I know now, even though commercial travels going up with
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:11.080]   for tourists are hurting because of business travels dying.
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:12.080]   Yeah.
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:15.920]   I mean, face to face, especially in sales, being in someone's presence makes a huge difference.
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:16.920]   It's just like anything else.
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:17.920]   I can hang up when you're on.
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:18.920]   I guess so.
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:20.480]   I can zone out on a Zoom.
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:24.960]   But when I'm in your face and I'm selling it, like the person half of sales and marketing
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:28.280]   is the person's belief in their product, which is getting you to believe it.
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:31.880]   And there is something to be said about being in the space to see that.
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:34.600]   So maybe you're not flying out 10 times a week.
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:37.720]   But when there's a big deal to be made or something to impress somebody, you would want
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:39.200]   to put some of my face to face.
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:41.040]   So I'd say why they could be bullish on it.
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:42.640]   I guess we'll have to wait and see.
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:46.400]   How about conferences, conventions, big meetings?
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.200]   We're going to do those still or those are those CES wants to have.
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:53.200]   That's January and ants can only go.
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:55.520]   I went to one CES and I never wanted to go again.
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:57.000]   Oh, you are at Pruitt.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.280]   Now I know it's not at Pruitt's next time.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.280]   I love CES.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:02.280]   It was just my en masse Scooby-Doo.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.080]   It knows you.
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:05.080]   Oh, yeah.
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:08.600]   Again, great experience for me to see all the people, see all the things.
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.480]   But I'm like, man, we are really like sardine canned up in here.
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:18.200]   And it's just I tell you, I'll be a little bit gun shy of getting into a big crowded
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:19.920]   space with a lot of people.
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:21.800]   Yeah, I'm not ready for you.
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:22.800]   Am I mine?
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:23.800]   Yeah, I would not do it.
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:27.760]   Being done with the CES is going to happen in January and Vegas.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:28.760]   Maybe.
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:29.760]   Yeah, maybe.
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:30.760]   Maybe.
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:31.760]   Maybe.
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:32.760]   Yeah, we'll see.
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:35.000]   Here's the thing though, as long as people still have corporate cards and like to drink
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.400]   and gamble, Vegas will still have conferences.
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:41.720]   But see, that's the point is that our company is going to continue to subsidize that kind
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:42.720]   of spend.
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:44.120]   That's expensive.
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:47.120]   I think the answer for sales because they're going to have savings in other places.
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:49.320]   Yes, sales and marketing are still going to do the thing.
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:51.200]   And I don't think that's going to change up everything.
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:56.800]   My remote argument is more about like, are we going to see 500 developers driving across
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:01.040]   Cupertino to arrive at an office park to write some code?
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:02.040]   Probably not.
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:04.800]   But yes, there will be in-person talent for people making hardware and people doing camera
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:06.200]   work and lots of stuff.
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:10.720]   But I mean, I think the general bias is going to go from an office being the thing that
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:14.120]   everyone does to remote slash some hybrid component.
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:15.120]   And I don't know exactly what that looks like.
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:18.680]   But to me, the trend line away from the old world is very clear.
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:23.000]   And that is exciting because I'm the remote worker for a stuff based company.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.400]   I would like to keep my job.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:30.720]   So there is, it's interesting to see the lag between virus information and the response
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:32.200]   time CES, for instance.
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:33.600]   Oh, this is exciting.
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:37.080]   We're going to have CES proof of vaccination will be required.
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:38.920]   See it's going to be fine.
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:42.960]   But I think we're all learning now proof of vaccination don't meet diddly anymore.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:46.800]   Especially with people taking it.
[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:52.040]   So as a person who's just recently traveled and it's my first time traveling throughout
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:53.040]   all of this.
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:54.600]   It's some places.
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:55.600]   It's some places.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:58.480]   I guess that I was telling you earlier, people are like, oh, what do you want to do?
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:01.280]   And I'm like, ah, I came here to see you.
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:02.440]   Like we're going to hang out here.
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:04.560]   Like we went out to some places outside.
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:09.080]   But it felt it really did put a worry in me.
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:10.480]   And I'm not a worrying person.
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:11.480]   I don't really care.
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:12.480]   I don't worry about anything.
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:17.040]   But the fact that I'm traveling with my child, I'm like, I don't really want to do much.
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:20.760]   Like yes saying you'll have to have proof of vaccination to go.
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:24.640]   Does that make you feel like, oh, let's go.
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:25.640]   Everybody's vaccinated.
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:31.160]   No, because you're not the only person CES people aren't the only people in Las Vegas.
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:36.520]   And by the way, I'm knowing I know a lot of people now are vaccinated who have admittedly
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:42.160]   not serious cases, but who have Delta variant who are communicable, who are spreading virus.
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:43.160]   Right.
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:44.520]   It doesn't mean you won't get it.
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:47.760]   Well, the fact that you remember the scene that I mentioned, you weren't going to get
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:48.760]   it.
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:49.760]   That's where it began, right?
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:50.760]   Right.
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:52.280]   See it began at CES, correct?
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:53.280]   We were very lucky.
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:58.960]   We went and Larry Magad asked me on Facebook a little while after.
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:13:59.960]   Did you get it?
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:00.960]   I said, what do you mean?
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:03.560]   He said, we all met with somebody who had COVID-19.
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:05.560]   We just didn't know it at the time.
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:06.560]   Yeah.
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:07.560]   Yeah.
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:13.400]   And then RSA shortly after that in February in San Francisco, again, the vaccine doesn't
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:14.680]   keep you 100% safe.
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:17.320]   It just helps you potentially from hopefully having a serious.
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:18.320]   I'm not going to die.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:20.880]   I'm not going to be hospitalized, but I may spread it.
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:21.880]   And that's the point.
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:24.920]   I could go to CES, bring it back here.
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:26.120]   You're not even have symptoms.
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:27.400]   Yeah.
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:28.400]   And so I don't know.
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:32.360]   I think this proof of vaccination, which we have thought it's going to be the best.
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:33.360]   It's better than nothing.
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:34.360]   We thought that would be the gold standard.
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:37.520]   We find everybody's vaccinated or tested.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.120]   I'm not sure that that's going to fly in the next few months.
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:43.120]   We'll see.
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:44.120]   It's not good enough for me.
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:45.720]   There's a little different up there.
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:48.840]   That's tall girl, tall girl in our chat room.
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:49.840]   She's tall too.
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:50.840]   She says CES.
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:51.840]   Hell no.
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:52.840]   Right.
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:53.840]   Thank you, tall girl.
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:54.840]   Thank you, tall girl.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:15:01.800]   What will happen is you'll start getting companies who are very nervous about attending
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:03.640]   CES pull out.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:04.640]   It's one big one.
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:05.640]   It's done.
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:06.640]   It's done.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:07.640]   And then you'll have others, right?
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:09.120]   Yeah, the dominoes will fall.
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:11.920]   We saw that happen in the spring of 2020.
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:12.920]   Yeah.
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:13.920]   Exactly.
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:15.680]   CES is already archaic though, I feel.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:17.360]   Well, that's kind of my point.
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.280]   What do you need it for?
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:20.280]   Sales?
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:23.720]   I mean, I went because I was told to and I knew there was going to be blackjack involved.
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:26.280]   So I went for years.
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:29.840]   I love looking at all the gadgetry and all especially the TVs.
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:30.840]   Like that was my jam.
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:31.840]   It's fun.
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:32.840]   The TVs.
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:34.920]   You can see all of them in there at one time.
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:37.280]   There is that part of it.
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:41.240]   That is the joy of CES besides the people in the drinking.
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:42.560]   Oh, wait, boss, sorry.
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:45.200]   The technological hands on is what it's all about.
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:49.400]   If you're able to do that, spread germs equally as what we want to do.
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:53.480]   What's interesting to me is this is not, I don't think, going to go away.
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:59.240]   So this is going to be the new kind of endemic, you know, there'll be new variants.
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:00.640]   It's not going to go away.
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:02.720]   So this is going to change how we work.
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:05.680]   How we travel conventions.
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:07.080]   All of this stuff is going to change.
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:08.240]   And it happens so quickly.
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:10.680]   I had a trip planned for me and my daughter.
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:12.400]   As I said, this is our first flight.
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:13.400]   I was like, you know what?
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:14.800]   You haven't been on a plane.
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:16.480]   I'm going to start taking place in our door.
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:19.320]   Let's just shoot down to Miami.
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:25.920]   So I booked this trip in like December or November to go down like at the end of February
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:28.800]   or beginning of March before spring break would happen.
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:32.600]   And then like February hit and Florida was just like on fire.
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:33.600]   And I'm like, oh my God.
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:35.080]   Okay, we can't go anywhere.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:36.080]   We can't.
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:37.080]   I can't go on a plane.
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:38.080]   We can't go to Florida.
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:42.160]   And then the next month spring break happened and Florida's numbers just took off from there.
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:45.880]   And I'm like, well, thank goodness I was at least smart enough to not go.
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:48.120]   But it changed every- You went to Sturgis instead, right?
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:49.760]   Yeah, a big right umbrella.
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:51.240]   Same, same, same.
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:54.680]   But yeah, it's really a weird time.
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:17:00.440]   Like I said, even now as we're traveling, we're in certain paths of people.
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:04.120]   Like people can all come see me as like, not this time.
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:08.600]   You know, I'm trying to keep my circle tight with people that I know are conscious and
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:11.360]   care about what's going on.
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:16.080]   From the edge of science comes this news, and I'm not sure it's true, but it's a short
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:30.080]   and a short story.
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:37.000]   Augmenting potatoes with a human g that encodes a fat regulating protein called FTO essentially
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:43.960]   alters the genetic code to rapidly mass produce proteins made otherwise identical potato plants
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:46.240]   grow crops that were 50% larger.
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:48.440]   This is from the Smithsonian magazine.
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:50.640]   I think that's what happened to Ant versus me.
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:56.200]   So there was a chromosome right there to just change things for 50% that I didn't get that
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:57.200]   he got.
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:01.240]   I'm trying to reverse engineer it right now, me and the potatoes.
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:06.480]   University of Chicago chemist, Chuan Hei, co-author of a paper published in Nature BioTech,
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:10.320]   told Smithsonian it was really a bold and bizarre idea to be honest.
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:13.240]   We were probably expecting some catastrophic effects.
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:15.240]   So why did you do it?
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:16.240]   Oh, come on.
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:18.520]   Scientists are always trying to create something that's good to get it.
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:19.520]   That's right.
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:21.080]   Have a few seen Jurassic Park.
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:22.080]   Go ahead.
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:23.320]   Leo, I have a question.
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:24.320]   Yes.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:27.200]   So what is your general stance on GMOs?
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:28.200]   I have no problem with it.
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:29.200]   This is a perfect example.
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.200]   Okay, good.
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:31.200]   So we're in the same body.
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:34.440]   I was kind of joking about potato thing because fundamentally this sounds great.
[02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:35.440]   I like potatoes.
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:36.440]   I eat potatoes.
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:39.080]   I'm making a big one, but someone works with rice too, by the way.
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:40.560]   But we don't know if it tastes different.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:43.360]   I mean, does it taste like chicken?
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:44.840]   No, it's just big.
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:46.840]   It tastes like big, exactly.
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:48.560]   Humans are long pork.
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:49.560]   It's like big.
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:53.000]   They call it RNA demethylation.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:59.080]   Demethylation increases the yield and biomass of rice and potato plants and field trials.
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:00.080]   That's great.
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.080]   Rice?
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:02.080]   Rice?
[02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:03.080]   Big giant rice.
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:05.280]   Haven't you won a giant rice?
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:06.680]   Does not haunt your dreams?
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:07.680]   Come on.
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:08.680]   Think bigger.
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:11.360]   Have we learned nothing?
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:12.360]   Apparently not.
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:15.360]   Look at the size of this rice.
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:17.880]   It's huge.
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:20.680]   I mean, what's wrong with that?
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:21.680]   Nothing wrong with that.
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:22.680]   We need that.
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:23.680]   No, we need it.
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:24.680]   There's a lot of people.
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:25.680]   There's climate change.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.680]   It's going to be harder to grow food and feed everybody.
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:28.680]   Absolutely.
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:29.680]   If that's the problem.
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:30.680]   Yeah.
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:31.680]   Exhilared rice is the solution.
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:33.600]   I want to potato the size of this table.
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:34.880]   I want giant potato.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:35.880]   It'd be great.
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:37.680]   What is the biggest potato ever grown?
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:40.920]   Oh, you think it's going to get a little bit?
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:42.600]   What is the biggest?
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:46.760]   I'm sure there's some small town that has a giant potato in its town.
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:47.760]   I know.
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:48.760]   It's never grown.
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:49.760]   This potato.
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:52.800]   Well, you know, this is the enamateur gardener.
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:58.040]   It grew the world's biggest potato.
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:00.280]   That is a catastrophic result right there.
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:01.600]   That's what the scientists were worried about.
[02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:03.480]   That is the ugliest potato I've ever seen.
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:09.960]   If you're on the audio, imagine a potato that got a huge cancerous tumor onto which you
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:11.720]   grew more cancerous potato tumors.
[02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:12.720]   That's what it looks like.
[02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:14.880]   It's a potato with two red peppers.
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:15.880]   Three heads.
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:16.880]   Three heads.
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:22.200]   And I had eight pounds for an avocado and a potato smashing the previous world record
[02:20:22.200 --> 02:20:23.200]   by nine.
[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:24.200]   That was more than some babies.
[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:27.000]   It's got an avocado on its forehead and two peppers for years.
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000]   It's a baby potato.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000]   Pass on your screen.
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.480]   That's the best way to describe it.
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:34.480]   If you bake to that thing, you could feed an army.
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:36.400]   Unfortunately, go on some baking bits.
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:38.440]   The rest of the articles behind the paywall.
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:42.920]   And you know in general, there's that thing about ugly fruits and vegetables, the places
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:46.840]   that sell them because we only get to see the sexy vegetables at the store.
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:48.320]   So I mean, it's still a vegetable.
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:52.240]   There's a new food delivery service that only delivers ugly.
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:54.480]   Yeah, ugly vegetables need to be too.
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:55.480]   As an over-wept vegetable.
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:57.480]   I subscribe to that.
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:58.480]   Distress.
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:20:59.480]   Ugly vegetables need love too.
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:00.480]   They do.
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:01.480]   I think you're right.
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:04.920]   You're a poor opportunity vegetable snacker, especially when it comes to potatoes, which
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:07.520]   could be fries, which could be ogrotin.
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:08.520]   Okay.
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:09.520]   Okay.
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:11.600]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:15.760]   It's great to see Alex Wilhelm soon to be a father.
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:16.760]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:19.560]   I got to stop telling you guys.
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:21.600]   He's trying as hard as he can.
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:23.360]   I'm the guy, father, right here.
[02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:24.840]   I heard Owens in the mix.
[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:27.080]   I heard Owens, "Owina," you know what I mean?
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:28.080]   The case is a girl.
[02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:29.080]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:30.080]   I got it.
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:31.080]   I can do this.
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:32.080]   Owens in the end will be actually loved.
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:33.080]   Hey, hey.
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:35.080]   Look, but "Owina" is not.
[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:40.080]   I'm just, I'll get if it's a, by the way, if it's a boy, I'm in their life.
[02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:41.080]   Kind of weird.
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:42.080]   I got it.
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:46.080]   That's the name of the giant potato is a "ween" that might be the taste of the giant potato.
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:51.120]   Alex, Alex, I just want to tell you, I tried to make as many babies as I could in that house.
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:58.000]   You are going to have much better luck than I did, sir.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:01.200]   I'm not going to come entirely in that, but I hate to say that as always, it's a real
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:04.040]   treat to be on Twitter.
[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:06.840]   I need to put a bathroom in my office because I drank a lot of tea.
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:07.840]   Go, go, go.
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:08.840]   TechCrunch, read him.
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:10.240]   He's a reporter there.
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:12.040]   He's @Alex on the Twitter.
[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:13.040]   Thank you, Mr. Wilhelm.
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:14.040]   Pleasure, Leo.
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:15.040]   Thanks for having me.
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:16.040]   All right.
[02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:19.240]   I always used to pee in the back there over the corner of the garden over there.
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:20.240]   Smells like it.
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:22.360]   So you can tell.
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:27.960]   For those who do not know, Alex lives in my childhood home, which is a long stream.
[02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:28.960]   It's like a long stream.
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:29.960]   But there is no change story.
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:31.960]   It's also Leo's fault that it's so haunted.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:32.960]   It's haunted.
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:39.560]   The ghost of Panos Panay just rolls around throwing a cobble on it.
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:40.560]   I got an idea.
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:41.560]   Here's an idea.
[02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:42.560]   Satya Lesson.
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:43.560]   Satya Lesson.
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:44.560]   It's going to be beautiful.
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:46.800]   He's just pee patient.
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:53.280]   Mr. Retirement is beckoning, but he's only kind of retired Dwight Silverman.
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:54.960]   Great to have you two.
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:58.400]   In your retirement with this show, that's fantastic.
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:00.640]   It's always wonderful to be on here, Leo.
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:07.280]   I just am amazed at how long I've been a guest, a panelist on here.
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:09.040]   I can't see I go back and look it up.
[02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:10.040]   It's like 2000.
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:15.320]   We've been doing this is one of the longest running podcast.
[02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:18.440]   It might be one of the longest continuous running podcast.
[02:23:18.440 --> 02:23:23.280]   I mean, I guess there's, but we've been doing this since 2005.
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:26.520]   So we're entering our 16th year.
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:29.760]   Yeah, our 17th actually.
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:30.760]   We're in our 17th year.
[02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:33.040]   Well, I'm always honored to be on it.
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:38.840]   And I'm particularly proud of the fact that now that I have clicked the no longer working
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:46.080]   at Forbes link on LinkedIn, my current open status as a panelist at Twit.
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.080]   What's that on your resume?
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:48.600]   At the top of my.
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:49.600]   Perfect.
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:50.600]   Jobs on LinkedIn.
[02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:51.600]   Perfect.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:52.960]   So that's my current job.
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:53.960]   I love analyst.
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:56.520]   We should call him that twit panelist.
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:23:57.800]   Put that on the lower third.
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:23:59.320]   It's great to see you as always.
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:00.840]   Yeah, long time we've been friends.
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:01.840]   That's great.
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:06.760]   That's one of the things I really cherish about doing this is people like you and Alex
[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:13.040]   and Owen, I've known and I consider good friends, which is great because I don't actually have
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:16.120]   to see you and take you out to dinner or anything.
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:18.240]   Unless Owen, we could go out to dinner.
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:20.440]   Did Lisa say we could go out to dinner?
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.440]   That's how the virtual phone works out.
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:25.280]   Owen J.J. Stone, IQMZ.
[02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:28.040]   Before you wrap this up, I just want to thank everybody for joining us.
[02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:31.200]   Owen likes to wrap up the show on his own.
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:36.360]   We do the show every Sunday afternoon, 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:40.720]   You can watch us make it live at twit.tv/live.
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:42.520]   There's live audio and video streams there.
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:48.880]   If you're watching live chat with us live either in the IRC, that's free to all IRC.twit.tv
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:53.880]   or in our Discord if you're a member of club twit, that way you can participate in the
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:57.880]   animated excitement going on in there.
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:05.880]   You also, I love the animated GIFs, I have to say, you also can get shows after the fact.
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:09.880]   I don't know where they find these.
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:12.880]   I told you that's the best part.
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:14.880]   I know the only thing you're answering.
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:15.880]   I'm sorry.
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:16.880]   I just credit everything else about it.
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:21.880]   That is literally the fun lifeblood, life juice of...
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:22.880]   It's so fun.
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:24.880]   I'm loving Discord.
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:30.320]   After the fact, on demand versions of the show are available at our website twit.tv, there
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:33.360]   is a dedicated YouTube channel for this week in tech.
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:35.680]   You can also subscribe in your favorite podcast client.
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:37.920]   I would encourage you to do so.
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:39.760]   In fact, if you do, leave us a review.
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:42.080]   Please, five stars would be nice.
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:43.080]   Tell the truth.
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:44.080]   You don't have to lie.
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:47.880]   But put that review in there because we want to let the world know about this week in tech.
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:53.000]   You'd think after 17 years, everybody would know, but there's still a few, a handful of
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:56.080]   holdouts we've never heard of the show.
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.080]   What else?
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:01.080]   If you are listening after the fact, we have other ways of interacting.
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:03.920]   Of course, there's our forums at twit.community.
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:07.160]   There's our mastodon at twit.social.
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:11.800]   And of course, the Discord, if you're a member of club twit, we're in there all week long.
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:13.320]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:19.920]   And I am going to let, as always, the Reverend Owen J.J. Stone conclude today's festivities.
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:20.920]   Owen?
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:25.760]   So unfortunately for you, I am not an imprut, but I am wonderful as always.
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:29.320]   Let me just tell you something about the twit and the twit house that you might not know
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:30.320]   about.
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:33.600]   Like back in the day at the old twit house, they had a wall where guests would come and
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:34.600]   sign it.
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:39.800]   And I, being an insane person, stood on the wall and had Uncle Leo outline me in a sharpie.
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:40.800]   I remember.
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:45.480]   And for a good little while, Owen signed, Owen dared to sign inside my body.
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:47.480]   When they ran out of space, they started doing it.
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:50.880]   That's the kind of fun family stuff that we got going on here.
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:52.560]   It is just an awesome place.
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:56.740]   And just being here after, in my mind, I think it might be like six or seven years since
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:59.880]   I've been in the studio, which seems like forever, but not forever, because you've been
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:02.680]   doing the show since Chiseling Tablets.
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:08.440]   It's just impressive that you keep the toe going, the weight is, the panelists and the
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:09.440]   guests.
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:10.440]   Thanks to you guys really.
[02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:11.440]   We haven't been here.
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:13.120]   It's a great set up situation.
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:15.960]   I know we're still running 8.1, but let me tell you something.
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:20.200]   We're running 8.1 better than most people are running Mac, my M ones out here.
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:21.200]   Okay.
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:22.600]   A lot of shows I hear with some new tech.
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:23.600]   They ain't doing it.
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:25.720]   But the twit is doing over here in this world.
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:26.720]   Okay.
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:27.720]   Just say it now.
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:29.800]   So I just want to say again, love you viewers.
