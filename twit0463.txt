[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.920]   It's time for "Twit" this week in Tech
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.080]   to show where we talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.800]   And we've got a great panel, and we also
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.520]   have a box of tissues because Father Robert Balissaire is here.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.680]   And we may be watching the US lose at soccer we don't know.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.600]   But in case, it'll either be tears of sadness
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.360]   or tears of joy.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.960]   I live in hope.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.240]   Father Robert is the host of this week in Enterprise Tech
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.520]   and coding 101 and know-how.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.360]   He's one of the busiest guys in the network.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.200]   And it's so nice to have you here for this week in Tech.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.680]   You'll be hosting two weeks.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.920]   I-- I-- yes?
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   Yes, I will be.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.840]   Surprise, surprise.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.600]   I'm actually looking forward to that.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.320]   Can't wait.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.080]   I'm going to be in Hawaii in a couple of weeks.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.560]   Also with--
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.840]   Wait a second.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.280]   The US is playing in soccer right now.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.320]   Jason Heiner is going to stay right there.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.280]   Do not move.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.120]   CBS Interactive Tech Republic.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.440]   You know, this was a very hard panel to put together
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.920]   because it turns out apparently the World Cup is going on
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.640]   right now.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   It's kind of a big deal.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.480]   And the United States is playing Portugal as we speak.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.040]   But we'll give you play-by-play, everyone.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.080]   So if I-- and if I leap up and say goal and yell goal,
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.880]   that's why I'm horse.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.120]   I've been practicing all day.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.840]   I thought you were playing your vuvuzela.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.400]   Bring me the vuvuzela.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.800]   Which, thank goodness, they banned--
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.400]   They banned the vuvuzela.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.880]   That's why.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.600]   They started doing an airplane.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.840]   Like every time it was a goal, you
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.040]   just started doing an airplane.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.600]   Also with us, it's so good to have him back, Jerry Pournell.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.440]   Long time columnist at Bite Magazine Chaos Manor.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.760]   He still writes on the web, jerrypournell.com.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.480]   And of course, you might be familiar with a few science
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   fiction novels he's written over the years.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.360]   It's great to have you, Jerry.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.640]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.520]   Thank you.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.200]   Just back from Hilton Head Island,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.960]   where I guess you were at a nanotech conference.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.920]   The 30th anniversary of the conference,
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.520]   I think the formal name of it is sensors, activators,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.400]   and probes or something to the sort.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.160]   I'm going to the probe conference.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.560]   It started before nanotech was a word one used.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.040]   And most of what they were working in in those days
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.640]   was microns, which as far as I'm concerned,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.720]   a micron's pretty damn small to begin with.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.600]   This is the-- I'm going to read the official title,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.320]   The Solid State Sensors, Actuators
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.640]   and Microsystems Workshop.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.720]   Yes.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.440]   And that was the 30th anniversary of it.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.600]   And this one, in 1994, the conference theme
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.960]   was what will happen when sensors,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.800]   a microsystem actuators and sensors take over the world.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.760]   And in 2014, it was, well, we've kind of taken over the world.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.440]   Where do we go from here?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.960]   Which is where they invited a science fiction writer
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.800]   to namely me.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.440]   Oh, how cool.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.560]   So I'm familiar with MEMS, Microelectric Mechanical Systems.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.480]   And these are not quite nanotech.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.080]   These are kind of microtech.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.040]   Some of it is nanotech.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.680]   Some of it is not.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.920]   Some of the people, the probe people,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.680]   and some of the others are actually down in nanometers.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.360]   Most of it is in microns, which is still pretty small.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.200]   Not a millionth of a meter is--
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.960]   It's a millionth of a meter.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   It's tiny.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.680]   And the nanotech is a billionth.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.080]   And to get some picture of it, a tenth of a nanometer
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.600]   is an angstrom unit.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.520]   So--
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.360]   No, I think it was a devorex.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.360]   Tin angstroms is a nanometer.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.920]   So that gives-- and atoms are typically about 10 angstroms
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.000]   across.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Right.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.680]   Atomic scale.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.760]   I think it was devorex who schooled me in MEMS
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.320]   and said, you know, they're in everything now.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.720]   Scales everywhere.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.560]   Everywhere.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.580]   You're right.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.040]   And they are doing them.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.520]   And they're very small.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.080]   And it's amazing what--
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.600]   I mean, they were showing stuff that you wouldn't believe
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.000]   could be done.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.240]   Only they're doing it with little bitty stuff that turns out
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.160]   to be not very hard to fabricate.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:15.320]   So do you want your TV screen lithograph on your arm?
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.600]   I guess you could do that now.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.280]   That's how we'll get flexible screens.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.560]   They are approaching it.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.960]   Being able to do a flexible screen with lithography.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.320]   And you know, you have lithograph on your arm,
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.840]   if you want to.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.280]   So was there anything there that surprised you?
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.200]   A lot of stuff, but most--
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.280]   but understand this is practical stuff.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.720]   This is stuff that's working.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.280]   They're making products out of it.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.840]   They're selling them as opposed to the things
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.920]   that if you go to one of Kurtzweld's conferences,
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.560]   it's all going to be things that are happening 20 years from now.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.400]   A lot of blue skies.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.160]   Maybe.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.000]   And maybe they won't.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.760]   That's always bothered me when you have these conversations
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.360]   about nanotech.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.840]   There seems to be a lot of sci-fi with all due regard to you,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.080]   Jerry.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.920]   A lot of stuff like, in the future,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.360]   we'll be able to be Gragu and things.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.000]   That is the attitude of this conference towards that picture.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.280]   It reminded me of the conference.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   Gragu conference, no.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280]   I'm not going to that.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.640]   For the last 30 years, commercial fusion power
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.200]   was going to be online in 30 years.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.920]   And every year--
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.420]   Right.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.560]   Well, it's not that late.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.080]   Yes, year.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.160]   But 30 years from now.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.640]   Next year.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.640]   And it's still 30 years from now.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.440]   Best I can say.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.640]   This is stuff you can buy today.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.280]   There is a kid there who's got a gizmo
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:47.560]   that you attach to your computer with a serial cable.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.600]   It's got a stage on it.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.800]   You can then do electron microscopy.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.120]   And they'll sell it for under--
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.760]   they're hoping they sell it for under $100.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.600]   Wow.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.760]   So our eighth grade class will have an electron microscope.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.520]   Have an electron microscope.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.400]   There's another gizmo.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.960]   You attach to your telephone.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.720]   And it's got a little spring and a needle in it.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.680]   You put your finger in the cup and you twist it and bonk.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.200]   It stabs you and draws a drop of blood.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.640]   Well, I have a question.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.960]   What's a telephone?
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.800]   It does.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.360]   Well, the phone is good enough to do a complete blood sugar
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.320]   analysis for diabetics.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:35.760]   That's cool.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.120]   But it does more than that.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.520]   It looks at ketones.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.480]   It looks at various other things.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.320]   And if it thinks it needs to, it telephones your doctor.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:44.880]   So you have--
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880]   That's interesting.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.000]   --that you can buy for under $100 or at least they
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.240]   hope to be able to sell that shortly for under $100.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.400]   And it's venture capitalists putting money into the company.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.000]   You know, at CES, we saw a company that, I think,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.120]   was digital experience.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.400]   They were showing off what looked like a tricorder.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.680]   Obviously, they used the inspiration
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.280]   from Star Trek to create a device that they were doing
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.080]   a Kickstarter for.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.720]   And they said, well, we've developed technology that
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.760]   will allow you to hold it next to the skin.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.360]   And you can find everything from blood sugar to pulse rate
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.480]   to oxygen saturation.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.560]   And some of it sounded very plausible.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.760]   But then they were starting to say,
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.400]   and it scans for your blood for pathogens.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.120]   And I started thinking, I think maybe you're
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.520]   heading a little bit too far into the sci-fi.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.520]   That sort of technology, although it's very cool,
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.600]   I don't think we're anywhere near yet.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.200]   The ability to wave a wand over someone's skin
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.760]   and be able to tell all that sort of information simply
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.000]   by shining infrared light doesn't seem really--
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.120]   By shining an infrared light.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.800]   But by ultrasound, you can do a lot of things.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.960]   And that is getting down to becoming an app on your cell phone.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.320]   Well, we feel like-- it feels like we're headed that way
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.520]   with Apple announcing HealthKit and the health app.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.360]   And I think this will be at Google I/O.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.080]   We're going to see Google Android Wear.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.320]   There's rumors that LG and others will show Google watches,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.040]   Google Android Wear-based watches that will have some health
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.680]   aspect.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.760]   But I'm actually really glad Jerry's here,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.040]   because I have a question.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.160]   You mentioned Kickstarter.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.800]   This has been going on on Kickstarter.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.480]   It's a Kickstarter project.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.000]   And I just want to ask you, Jerry, because I
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.920]   know you have enough background to answer this question.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.400]   Former professor of engineering and an expert
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.440]   on this kind of stuff.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.080]   It's called I Find the World's First Battery Free Item
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.440]   Locating Tag.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.080]   They were looking for $25,000.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.160]   They still have a week to go.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.040]   They've raised half a million dollars.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.680]   And I think there's a significant question
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.160]   of whether this is, in fact, a scam.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.960]   Kickstarter is not responding to a lot of people,
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.280]   if you watch the comments, who claim there's no way
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:52.800]   this could work.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.080]   Now, you tell me, Jerry, it's Bluetooth.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.440]   It says it doesn't need a battery.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.360]   They say they get-- now, this is the thing
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.080]   that worries me.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.080]   They say it recycles electromagnetic energy
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.320]   and stores it in a unique power bank,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.560]   so you don't have to have batteries for this Bluetooth
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.000]   design.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.240]   Now, I've heard of RFID.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.320]   It doesn't need power.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.240]   RFID kind of does that.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.400]   Bluetooth is a radio transmitter.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.920]   Jerry, does this seem possible?
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.960]   Well, if it doesn't need--
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.040]   like RFID, it doesn't have to have a battery
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.600]   if you were coming around with some kind of gizmo
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.920]   that powers it.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:43.440]   But you understand a gadget that does recording
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.240]   of what's going on without having to have a battery,
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.680]   and it is every spook's dream.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.080]   It's a perpetual motion machine, that's what it is.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.800]   Well, but I mean, every intelligence officer in the world
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.640]   wants one of those and would be willing to pay an awful lot
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.360]   for it because the batteries run out.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.840]   You bug the guy's office.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.960]   That's fine.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.240]   But unless you can connect it to his telephone,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.680]   you have no power source.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.840]   And the batteries run out after a while, which
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.680]   is by the way why there is no telephone in any clean room.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.960]   And if you go to a meeting at the agency,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.600]   they make you leave your cell phone outside.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.280]   Well, if they--
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.040]   Maybe onto something.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.080]   Maybe this is a CIA budget cut thing,
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.520]   which is like one department of the CIA that's
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   running a little kick-down.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.360]   The CIA is kick-starting their spying now.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.400]   It just doesn't seem--
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.200]   It doesn't seem right to me.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.880]   If it's really Bluetooth, it's got to have a battery.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.920]   If it's RFID, I understand it doesn't have to have a battery.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.640]   But it wouldn't be much use because you'd
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.680]   have to track something.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.120]   You'd have to be standing on top of it.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.760]   Well, they claim a 60-meter range.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.520]   So that even puts a beyond the range of Bluetooth.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.520]   I think this is bogus.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.000]   I mean, this is higher power Bluetooth.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.400]   If you read the comments, a lot of people have asked questions.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.120]   The company has not responded very well or thoroughly.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.280]   And yet, Kickstarter has not pulled this down.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.520]   The Kickstarter approved it, I presume, although I gather that
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.720]   they're not quite as careful now as they are about screening
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.680]   Kickstarter projects.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.200]   And then Kickstarter did remember, say,
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.760]   you have to have a physical prototype.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.000]   There's no prototype.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.200]   And they want you to do a fairly complete risks and challenges.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   If you read in the risks and challenges page,
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   it says the main risks are reliance
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.360]   on outside sources within the supply chain.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.080]   The contractor has to order components from other vendors.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.240]   If these vendors slip, the complete production's at risk.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.000]   It seems like there's more risks than that.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Like it's a physical impossibility.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.080]   I could build you a gizmo that used,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.000]   I think it would be illegal to do it,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.360]   but used Bluetooth frequencies that worked out to 50 years.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.720]   That were powerful enough to activate an RFID Bluetooth
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.920]   receiver at 60 meters.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.000]   Is there enough energy--
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.520]   I don't think it was illegal to do that.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.920]   Is there enough electromagnetic energy in the air
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.400]   so that I wouldn't need a battery?
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   I could just collect the--
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.320]   Well, not--
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   Did it in Heinlein--
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.320]   Did it in Heinlein?
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.840]   In the whole race.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.560]   Didn't Heinlein-- what was the book where it had the little--
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.600]   Sunstones.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.760]   Yeah, they would collect power from the--
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.800]   And that was Tesla's dream.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.080]   You were going to be able to do it.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.240]   But the problem is that the inverse square lock
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.880]   kind of ruins you.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.040]   Actually, it's inverse cube when you're broadcasting power.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.480]   The farther away you get the amount of power,
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.400]   you get decreases by the inverse of the cube.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.000]   It's a huge down.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.600]   I think this is possible.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.760]   I mean, so if we give these guys the benefit of the doubt
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.840]   and we say, OK, they say they've got patent pending technology,
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.080]   we give them the benefit of the doubt
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.480]   and assume that this actually does work.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.800]   It would be quite a breakthrough, ultimately.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.000]   But I think we have to assume that this is pretty untested.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.320]   Nobody else that we know of is using this kind of thing
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.280]   or has successfully productized this kind of thing.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.600]   And so even if it does work, if we assume that it does work,
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:03.480]   I think we have to also assume that this is something
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.640]   that's going to have some hiccups and that is going to be untested.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.000]   You are way too kind, Jason.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.200]   When they say patent pending, they mean,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.800]   I got the patent right here.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.840]   I'm just going to-- next time I go down that way, I'll file it.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.840]   I'll file that.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:25.440]   They say it uses our patent pending EM harvesting technology.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.200]   I can't wait to see that.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.160]   That's going to change the world.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.440]   That sure sounds to you.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.200]   Yeah, that's Tesla's dream.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.080]   And there have been a lot of people
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.800]   trying to do what Tesla claimed he knew how to do, but never did.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.120]   So who knows?
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.640]   Well, I don't think so.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.120]   Is anybody calling these guys?
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.200]   You know, I should really pursue this more.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.440]   Pando Daily's been spending a lot of time on this.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.640]   My point is you have seven days if you did give them money,
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.320]   you have seven days to take it back,
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.120]   because in seven days they're going to cash the check.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.000]   In effect, the Kickstarter will get funded,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.240]   and that money will be withdrawn.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.640]   And at that point, you have new recourse, even if you never
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.320]   see anything.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.000]   Although Kickstarter, I think, has some mechanism
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   for getting your money back.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.560]   I don't know how well that works.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.720]   I mean, I might have somebody call these guys actually on Monday.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.760]   Would you get on that?
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.480]   Would you get it's called We Tag?
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.440]   It's on Kickstarter.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.600]   I find is the device they've raised half a million dollars.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.080]   And that's pretty staggering.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.920]   Is that if you've got a gadget that will do that,
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.760]   I can think of so many things that are more--
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.760]   They're the key finder.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.360]   --and things to do.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   You could power my car.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.720]   That may be from my whole background,
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.480]   but I can think of lots of things I would love
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.160]   to be able to do with a gadget that can do that.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.880]   Well, we're talking about a ridiculously low amount of power.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.640]   I mean, this is--
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.760]   How low can Bluetooth go?
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.520]   I mean, they're calling it Bluetooth Lite.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.000]   They're not called Bluetooth Lite.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   It's L-E.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.840]   Well, they don't say it's Bluetooth Lite.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.960]   It's Bluetooth Lite.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:57.400]   So, I mean, you could get it down into, you know,
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.960]   technically maybe 5.5, 1 milliamp, somewhere in that vicinity.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.680]   But you're still going to need a lot of power.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.760]   And so you're going to have to beam energy straight
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.680]   at this device in order to give it enough juice
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.280]   to run on its special reservoir of power.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.480]   We will watch with interest.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.200]   Jason, get your tech republic news hounds on that one.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.080]   Yeah, we'll do.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.240]   We'll try to get ahold of them.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.200]   See what that tells.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.160]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.960]   When we come back, Amazon had a big party in which they
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.840]   announced a new phone.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.040]   Interesting, because we'd heard a lot about the phone.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.400]   But when we found out the details,
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.960]   there was a lot of stuff we hadn't heard about yet.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.400]   And one of the rumors that proved--
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.200]   only to be semi-true was the notion this was a 3D phone.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.840]   Not exactly.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.800]   It's dynamic perspective.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.880]   We'll talk about that.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.240]   And more Jerry Purnell is here from jaypurnell.com,
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.600]   my hero, my inspiration, and a great--
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.480]   great to be able to call him a friend.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.840]   Also with us, Jason Heiner, tech republic, also my hero,
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.560]   and pottery, Father Robert Bauzer.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.200]   Also my hero.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.880]   You're all my heroes.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.240]   You're the wind beneath by something, my cushion.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.560]   But first, a word from Citrix and the folks who do go
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.800]   to meeting.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.120]   If you are in business, you know that getting people together
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.160]   to hash out differences, to brainstorm, to plan is so
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.880]   important.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.280]   But nowadays, with businesses spread out all over the world,
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.960]   it's hard to get people together so that you can communicate.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.320]   If you're pitching clients, they could be in Louisville.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.880]   And we could be in Petaluma.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.080]   How are we going to make that work?
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.560]   How can we make that work?
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.440]   Go to meeting.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.960]   Go to meeting, yeah, it's the most efficient way
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.600]   to meet with clients and customers,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.840]   right from your computer or your smartphone or your tablet.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.720]   You can meet-- one nice thing about Go to Meeting
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.640]   is you pay once a month a flat rate.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.480]   You don't have to count the minutes of the meetings.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.880]   That means you can have it all day if your team is spread out.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.120]   You can meet as often as you like with anyone, anywhere
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.800]   in the world.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.880]   Go to meeting, let's just share screens
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.600]   so you can review documents.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.560]   I've actually used it to rehearse presentations
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.120]   in real time.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.360]   You could also use the built-in HD video conferencing.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.040]   So just like Jason and I, well, we
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.920]   could see each other face to face.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.080]   As we're looking at those screens,
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.040]   cut out the wasted time and expensive travel
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.560]   without losing the personal touch of meeting in person.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.200]   And you could do it right now with Go to meeting.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.120]   We use it for every one of the meetings we do,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.240]   even if it's just a conference call.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.040]   Because it makes it so much easier if you want to fire up
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.240]   the camera or you want to fire up the screen sharing.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.080]   Go to meeting.com, try it free for 30 days.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.480]   Just click the try it free button at go to meeting.com
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.160]   and use the promo code TWIT.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.320]   And you've got 30 days free.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.880]   No, two, meeting.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.720]   We thank the folks at Citrix who have been such great supporters
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.680]   of the network practically since day one.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.360]   So we knew when we went to the Amazon or watched the Amazon
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.000]   event, they didn't stream it, which frustrated me.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.640]   Did you send anybody, Jason?
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.080]   We had Larry getting in there.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.240]   Larry, Larry did.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.040]   Yep, was there?
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.560]   It was a small group about the auditorium,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.160]   the Fremont Theater in Seattle.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.680]   I've seen differing reports, but it's
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.520]   hundreds of people, not thousands.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.120]   Amazon said that several hundred people
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.400]   were there because they had from the public.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.640]   Because you remember on the front page at Amazon.com,
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.360]   they said, would you like to come to the event, post a video,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.400]   or ask for an invitation?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.240]   And several hundred of the-- I think they said 60,000 people
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.680]   who applied got invitations.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.480]   There were about 200 press there.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.080]   And Jeff Bezos did the whole thing, 90 minutes on stage,
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.040]   showing off Amazon's first phone, the fire phone.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.960]   A phone that Bezos said later, they'd
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.640]   been working on for four years.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.520]   That explains the rumors we've been hearing for four years
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.040]   that Amazon would do a phone.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.880]   One of the things everybody thought maybe Amazon would do
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.280]   with a phone is offer it for free as part of a prime subscription
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.640]   or make it really low cost.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.880]   None of that happened.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.320]   It's not in fact cheaper than any other phone.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.040]   And it is not carrier free.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.680]   It requires AT&T in the US.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.640]   200 bucks with a two-year contract.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.080]   650 bucks unsubsidized for the 32 gig version,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.120]   754 the 64 gig version.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.720]   And it's a pretty-- I mean, if you look at it,
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.920]   it seems like a fairly typical high-end smartphone.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.000]   Running a version of Android that Amazon calls Fire OS 3.5.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.840]   And that was one thing I think that one of my takeaways
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.360]   is there is now a fourth mobile OS, along with Android and iOS
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.880]   and Microsoft's Windows phone.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.800]   I guess it could be fifth of you in good BlackBerry.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.960]   This fork of Android is really a new mobile OS.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.120]   I think that this is differentiated enough.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.960]   It doesn't use Google services.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.600]   The maps come from Nokia's Hear Division.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.160]   They're Hear Maps.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.840]   The store is Amazon's own store, quarter of a million apps
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.480]   in that store.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.200]   Unfortunately, most designed for the Amazon tablets--
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   I don't know how many will work well on the phone.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.360]   But without Google services, it's not an Android phone.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.040]   Jason, is Fire OS really a fully qualified operating
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.800]   system in its own right?
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   I mean, I think it's good enough.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.840]   I think that it's good enough to call it its own thing
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.080]   and not an Android fork now.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.360]   I guess the thing that the only thing that this phone really
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.480]   innovates is it's a shoppers phone, right?
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.840]   And they do some innovative things with the--
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.200]   A Firefly feature.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.160]   With Firefly, exactly.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.080]   That's the crux of the story.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.600]   I think for me is they're innovating with shopping.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.560]   I don't know that they can get people to buy on that.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.440]   I think that's a great feature.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.880]   I don't know that that's a feature
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.560]   that somebody's going to buy on or somebody's
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.200]   going to switch on.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.240]   I think the 3D interface stuff is pretty gimmicky.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.440]   And I don't think-- and is potentially
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.200]   going to be even sort of confusing and not necessarily
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.600]   fantastic user experience.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.720]   Did Larry get to play with it at all?
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.080]   So we have some hands-on over on ZDNet.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.520]   We've got some hands-on--
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.920]   He said it was very--
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.720]   The Firefly was surprisingly accurate
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.680]   that it picked up a lot of the things he pointed at that.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.000]   It's not just stuff you buy.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.200]   It's paintings.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.440]   It's music.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.040]   Music.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.040]   Movies.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:18.240]   Movies.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.680]   You could show it at a TV screen and it'll
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.480]   know what you're watching.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.680]   And that's why I think-- I think--
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.200]   Jason's right in that there's nothing in this phone that's
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.520]   going to cause people to switch.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.600]   If you're a phone guy, if you're a geek--
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.400]   Well, see, that's the question.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.760]   Looking for the hardware, this is an end.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.240]   Microsoft is so late to the party
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.200]   and they're struggling struggling with--
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.360]   I would say a very good operating system when it's phone 8.1
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.600]   or it will soon to be 8.1.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.560]   And it's hard just because they're a couple of years
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.000]   late and everybody's either invested in Android or ROS.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.720]   It does feel like Amazon has at least paved the way better.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   They've been building this app store.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.920]   But you think-- is it enough?
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.040]   It is, in this sense.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.840]   Bezos specifically said in his address that they wanted
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.520]   to build a phone for their most engaged customers.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.680]   I mean, he tells everyone--
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.760]   It's where Amazon prime uses it.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.000]   Yeah, this is-- it's not a cheat.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.800]   He's saying, look, if you're just looking for the best phone
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.240]   out there, this is probably not it.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.080]   Because we don't care about the people who are looking for
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:09.880]   phones.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.040]   We want the person who buys so much from Amazon, media, and
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.880]   products, and movies, and entertainment, everything, that
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.960]   it makes sense for them to have Amazon in their pocket.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.880]   And it's what they've been doing with their tablets.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.280]   I mean, you look at their tablets and their decent devices,
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.080]   nice screens, decent specs.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.520]   But people have always said, well, why would I buy that
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.320]   when I could buy a Nexus?
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.280]   Why would I buy that when I could buy a better Android
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:32.640]   tablet?
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.520]   And the reason is because you've bought into Amazon.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.960]   And people will say, well, is that enough?
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.480]   And Bezos would say, yeah, there is.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.400]   There's enough people who just like Amazon
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.840]   that they'll buy this phone.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.240]   And Amazon can take a loss on every phone as long as they get
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.640]   more people buying into the Amazon ecosystem.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.840]   They'll in Michigan in our chat room says the only thing
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.160]   worse than a phone from an advertising company, Google,
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.120]   is a phone from a retailer.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.640]   Amazon.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.840]   I think Robert's right that they aim this at the Amazon
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.480]   customers, the Amazon ecosystem.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:03.880]   And it comes--
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.560]   Well, you get $100 off if you're prime customer.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.160]   Then it's less than an iPhone.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.480]   Yeah, and worse for home.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.160]   I mean, Bezos is absolutely right.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.440]   Remember how for years and years we had this joke?
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.000]   I used to have it in my column.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.680]   Next year, Amazon will make a profit.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.480]   And it went on for years.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.200]   And we laughed like hell.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.440]   And suddenly, they not only made profits,
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.160]   they made them in spades with big casino.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.360]   You got to admire a guy who's willing to not take a profit
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.320]   for 10 years in order to build the fulfillment centers.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.080]   I mean, he controls the dials at any point, Amazon.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.160]   And he wanted exactly that.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.960]   He wanted a group of people who, when he comes up with a telephone,
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.880]   they're going to say, yeah.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.040]   Well, he got him.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.400]   There's something here.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400]   Do you remember when--
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.040]   And in fact, they should.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.840]   Those are the kinds of people who ought to have that phone.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.320]   Exactly.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.360]   That's the Amazon crowd.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.200]   Do you remember when you first started buying Amazon?
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.440]   You bought it on Amazon because it was cheaper.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.360]   You found the thing that was cheaper.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.080]   And that's why you went to Amazon.com.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.720]   Now, I buy everything we use for shows here.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.440]   I buy from Amazon.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:12.720]   Who here is Amazon?
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.680]   But it's Amazon.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.880]   Who here is Amazon Prime?
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.000]   Amazon Prime, you're Amazon.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.680]   Jason, are you Amazon Prime?
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.080]   Jerry, are you Amazon Prime?
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.240]   And the audience, everybody.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.360]   So you know what?
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:23.720]   He said--
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.600]   How many in the audience tell me?
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.520]   Pretty much everybody.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.440]   He said--
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:26.800]   OK.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.280]   Jeff said tens of millions.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.400]   They've never said how many Amazon Prime members there are.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.320]   So we know there's 20 million or maybe more, but at least 20 million.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.360]   It's a small group.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.480]   And yet every geek in this room is a member.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.280]   Because it's addictive, isn't it?
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.720]   And we don't care about the price anymore.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.200]   Not anymore?
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.080]   I don't do price comparison.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   I'm going to get it in two days.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:45.600]   And you know what?
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.400]   If the shipping doesn't save Prime, I won't--
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.800]   I'll look at the product that's $10 more expensive.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.960]   They get that little checkbox that says it's
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.720]   available on their Prime.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.760]   And you check that box.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.240]   I'm a sucker.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.000]   I think it's going to have a hard time converting us to--
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.800]   We're not going to buy the phone, exactly.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.320]   No.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:26:59.680]   No.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.480]   So I do think this is strategically a missed opportunity
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:03.960]   for them.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.520]   Because I think what they could have done,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.080]   and probably should have done, was they should have basically
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.040]   sold a phone, whatever, less hardware,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.600]   quick messing with the sort of 3D goofy thing.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.760]   And sold a phone for $350 off contract, or $50 on contract,
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.280]   whatever.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.960]   It includes Prime with it.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.400]   And then they give you this very simple value proposition.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.040]   When you get our phone, you get Prime with it,
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.320]   not only you get these benefits of free shipping
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.880]   on your Amazon stuff, but you get free music streaming.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.560]   You get free videos.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.360]   You can get rid of these subscriptions
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.760]   that you have to these services and save you money.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.560]   And we'll give you free storage.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.320]   That's tough to do.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.680]   For instance, Amazon has launched a Prime streaming music service,
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.080]   but they only have a million songs.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.920]   It's hard for them to make the deals that Apple and Amazon--
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.280]   For the added all million to my playlist.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.920]   But it's still--
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.280]   It's not the new one.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.520]   But it's a good value proposition.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.240]   It's a very simple value proposition to a user and say,
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.120]   when you get our phone, you also get all these services for free
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.920]   and having to pay $10 here and $10 there and $7.99 here,
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.840]   and for all these things and get Nickel and Diamond.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.840]   You get our phone, you get all the ecosystem with it,
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.560]   and it's free.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.760]   But couldn't they still do that?
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.600]   Couldn't they still do that?
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.440]   Do you remember when they released the Kindle?
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.800]   And they made a surprise for Kindle Prime users,
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.000]   the best customers they gave free Kindles.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.480]   What if they seeded the market with a million of these phones
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.160]   to their best Prime users?
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.560]   People start seeing, oh, wow, they can get their stuff much better.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.920]   They go to a retail store and they whip out their phone.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.720]   It tells them the price of everything, and they just said,
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.600]   bye.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.800]   They could still, if the sales aren't high enough,
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.360]   use that model.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.080]   And that's actually what I like about this.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.840]   Because it might turn that on.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.480]   Because it's their platform, they have the option.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.760]   They do have the eyeballs also.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.240]   So the other thing with that, kind of what you're getting at,
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.400]   Robert, I think this is what they should have led with
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.240]   and not what they have led with instead,
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.040]   in their announcement, is something stronger like this.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.600]   But they also have the advantage of all these eyeballs
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.720]   that come to Amazon.com every day,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.800]   and they can promote this phone to them.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.960]   And we also shouldn't underestimate that
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.800]   because the value of that is something that Apple has
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.920]   to pay a lot of money for.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.880]   It's something that Google has to pay a lot of money for.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.520]   Obviously, Google can do it a little bit,
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:23.520]   but slapping an annexus sort of text ad on Google pages
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.720]   is one thing.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.200]   Being able to put a flashy our phone for this much,
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.880]   if they discount it or start giving them away or whatever,
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.560]   on an Amazon page or on an Amazon checkout
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.440]   is something that is super valuable.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.760]   I hear that argument a lot,
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.760]   but I don't think it's pushed the Fire TV
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.960]   to the top of the heap or the Kindle Fire HDX
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.800]   to the top of the heap.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   I think they're probably selling okay.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.640]   We don't know 'cause Amazon doesn't break those sales
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.480]   figures out.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.360]   And there's an interesting irony with the Fire phone
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.320]   that Prime users, I guess it's best target,
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.600]   are the most, among the most sophisticated internet users,
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.560]   I would think.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.320]   And yet, one of the features on this phone
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.160]   that I think makes it very appealing to first time
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.640]   smartphone buyers is the Mayday button.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.360]   I mean, I think if my mom or somebody who's never owned
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.520]   a smartphone came to me and said,
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.160]   which smartphone should I get?
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.160]   If they shop on Amazon,
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.960]   and I would say get the Amazon phone
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.640]   'cause of the Mayday button,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.160]   that's a different audience.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.480]   That's not my audience.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.920]   - So if they had that audience, again,
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.200]   if they went with sort of a lower priced phone
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.520]   and were targeting more of these entry level users,
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.160]   they could basically convert people to Amazon Prime users.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.440]   Then if, say, at some point they get rid
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.960]   of their Amazon phone, they don't have it anymore,
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.040]   and all of a sudden they don't have free shipping anymore.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.880]   Well, all of a sudden they're kind of addicted to it, right?
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.680]   They're like, this is a great service.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.640]   I don't have free movies.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.080]   I don't have free shipping on my Amazon stuff.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.240]   And now they're hooked in.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.960]   I think they should have used it that way
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.560]   'cause I think they got a much harder time converting
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.200]   technophiles and phone lovers and people
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.320]   who are already using Prime to buy this device
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.880]   and to go over to their ecosystem.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.920]   - For sure. - Rather than, when you can do
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.680]   all this stuff on your iPhone or your Android phone already.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:11.680]   - Are you at all convinced that that's the group
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.840]   that Bezos is after?
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.840]   I think he's got a good portion of the geek community
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.360]   as big as he's gonna get.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.120]   Most of them are not that happy with Amazon
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.000]   for other reasons anyway.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.320]   What he is after, I think, are people like my wife?
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.320]   And your mother, people who shop on Amazon
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.040]   and who don't really know much about smartphones
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.880]   and don't care much about them.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.680]   And here's an easy way to do it.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.160]   And that panic button is a wonderful idea.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.200]   - You know, it really works too.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.800]   - I caution you to remember this is Jeff Bezos.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:58.160]   This is the guy who built from what started out,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.880]   everybody thought was kind of a joke
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.080]   into an enormous company with huge resources
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.480]   that's essentially gonna pull Walmart out of business
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.280]   if it keeps it up.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.800]   - Yeah, no, I agree. - This is not a matter
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.880]   who did not consider all the questions you were asking.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.720]   - I agree with you.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.240]   I just think that their pitch hasn't been clear enough
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.960]   that that's who they're after.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.040]   And if they are after that crowd,
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.840]   and I guess we'll see there's still time, right?
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.480]   They just launched the thing.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.080]   But it certainly wasn't clear to me
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.760]   that that's what they're after.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.600]   - What are they?
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.960]   What is the strategy? - It's the strategy.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   - It's the strategy. - What is the strategy?
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.160]   - It started with the after.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.560]   - What is, why does Amazon do a phone?
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.680]   - To innovate shopping, innovate mobile shopping?
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.520]   - Yeah.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.040]   - Okay, the question there then is how long
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.600]   before we start seeing Firefly offered on Android devices?
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.640]   How long before they port that service
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.120]   to other mobile devices?
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.120]   - Amazon has an SDK.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.600]   So if you're best buying, you're worried
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.760]   that people are gonna use, by the way,
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.280]   this is kind of cool 'cause there's a dedicated
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.160]   firefight button on the phone.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.400]   Firefly launches within one second,
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.240]   and you can take a picture of anything.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.760]   And then as the phone ships,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.200]   it'll show you how to buy it on Amazon,
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.120]   but there's nothing to stop Best Buy
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.040]   from creating an app that says,
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.120]   "Press the firefight button,
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.840]   "and here's how much it is on it on Best Buy."
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.240]   - Why not? - Yeah.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.000]   - So maybe they did that on purpose
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.400]   so that Best Buy can't sue 'em for it.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.240]   I mean, 'cause it really is the ideal show rooming thing.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.280]   I like this made a button.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   Let me read you some stats.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.240]   This comes from Amazon's financial finance.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.240]   I think they're 10K that they filed recently.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.840]   The average response time on the made a button,
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.640]   9.75 seconds.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.920]   He promised under 15, he means it.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.280]   That's fast.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.440]   75, they must have a huge customer service team to do this.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.800]   Think of the cost of that.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.480]   75% of the questions from Kindle fire customers
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   come in through Mayday.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.280]   That's the first device that Mayday supported.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.560]   Questions from all around the world,
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.080]   including Australia, Bolivia, Egypt, Kenya, Santa Lucia,
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.160]   and Venezuela.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.720]   But what's really interesting is what they support.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.040]   So these are some of the things Bezos shared
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.720]   in the press release about how customers
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.800]   have been using Mayday over the first eight months.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.640]   This is before the fire phone.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:15.120]   After being stuck on a specific angry birds level for a week,
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.720]   somebody pressed the Mayday button
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.280]   and a tech advisor helped the customer beat the level.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.760]   (laughing)
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.720]   A group of friends were trying to figure out
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.480]   how to make a perfect peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.120]   They asked the Mayday advisor to judge,
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.480]   which approach was the best.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.320]   I don't know what the choice is there.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.160]   No, I want it.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.960]   Just peanut butter first to jelly first,
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.000]   peanut butter on the outside, not a non-starter.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.960]   Tech advisors sang Happy Birthday to somebody
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.000]   as they were receiving a fire HTX from their boyfriend.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.840]   He pressed the button, said,
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.960]   "Okay, I'm gonna give it to her right now."
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.960]   Sing Happy Birthday.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.640]   And he did, they did.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:56.240]   Customers have asked tech advisors to draw things.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.800]   'Cause you know, they have the ability
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.720]   to then manipulate the screen,
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.440]   including Happy Faces, Rainbows,
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.140]   unicorns, fire breathing dragons and aliens.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:11.200]   They have received, I think, 35 marriage proposals.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.040]   A lot of people ask for the woman who was in the ad
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.280]   who was not in fact a Mayday advisor.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.200]   Some people in the chatroom are making fun of this,
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.080]   but that's a lot more fun than Siri.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.280]   Yeah, Siri won't help you with angry birds.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.880]   I would press the Mayday button and say,
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.040]   "Can you give my homily for me?
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.640]   "I'm just gonna put you up with me."
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.080]   I didn't think of anything last night.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.800]   I need something for the sermon.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.280]   A Bible verse, anyone.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.120]   Just pick a Bible verse.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.520]   I think that's, you know, this is good marketing.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.440]   I mean, I don't know, I think it actually
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.120]   is probably the first new way of helping people
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.320]   use technology that actually works.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.360]   I mean, visual search, maybe there's an innovation here
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.280]   going on with visual search just in general.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.480]   You know, that's, sorry, I know that's different
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.720]   than the Mayday button, but I'm still going,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.880]   I'm going back to Firefly.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.720]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.760]   I do rail to Firefly, go ahead.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.800]   Sorry, but Firefly, I mean, I think that there--
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.840]   Firefly is probably more significant than Mayday.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.920]   I'll grant you that.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.640]   Yeah, I think the visual search bit of this,
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.960]   you know, could be pretty significant.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.440]   If it's the beginning of visual search,
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.640]   then that's a great thing and that's a great innovation.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.040]   And I think the lunch Amazon to turn on face recognition.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.600]   Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.800]   See you guys?
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.880]   Nobody wants this, but everybody wants this.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.040]   And you're thinking about Stalker, he's going,
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.200]   hey, she's cute, what's her name and home address.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.520]   But wouldn't it be great when you're walking up to somebody?
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.520]   I know this guy, why do I know him?
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.520]   You take up a surreptitiously, you push the--
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.080]   It goes, that's your friend Jerry Pournell.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.600]   You've been on Twitter 23 times.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.800]   Oh, hi Jerry!
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.040]   Wouldn't you want that, Jerry?
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.800]   I would want it.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.680]   I would want no one else around me to have it.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.040]   Very good.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.520]   Is that fair?
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.040]   Can we do that?
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:50.720]   Very good.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.120]   I think Jerry, your mic is muted.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.920]   I'm mute your mic.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:58.160]   Ooh, is it working now?
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.040]   Yeah, we hear you now.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.960]   OK, I hit the button to when I was coughing.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.000]   No, that's fine.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.240]   I need that face recognition.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.440]   But then I'm 80 years old and I've signed a hell of a lot of books
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.440]   in the last 40 years.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.760]   And everybody I ever signed a book for and wrote a personalization
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.200]   in it for me expects me to know them again when I see them,
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.520]   which is not always going to happen.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.240]   I am getting worse memory every year.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.880]   Fortunately, as bad as mine is, it's still better than Nivens
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.440]   was when I first met him 40 years ago.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.040]   So I know I can live.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.200]   Larry has no excuse.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.280]   He was a young man with bad memory.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.920]   Yeah, I need to give you one, make sure we understand one thing.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:50.720]   I have a certain predilection for being favorable to Amazon
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:56.320]   for the simple reason that a significant part of my income
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:02.640]   comes from selling 40-year-old books on Amazon in the e-books.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.840]   That, by the way, is not insignificant.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.080]   And it's one of the things--
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.640]   Where do you stand on this Amazon-heshet argument?
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.040]   This happened a few weeks ago.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.240]   People noticed that some major hashet books were no longer--
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.440]   you either couldn't order them on Amazon,
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.160]   or there was a three to four week wait, even though these books,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.520]   according to Hashet had been supplied to Amazon.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.400]   It was pretty clear Amazon had decided to do kind of a slow play
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:27.960]   on Hashet.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.520]   Are you going to tell me the bookstores never tried playing that game?
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.320]   That was Amazon's defenses.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.120]   Hey, you could still buy it on Amazon.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.760]   But what I'm getting at is traditional publishers
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.680]   have played the same game they didn't do too well at it.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.880]   Amazon may do better.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.160]   But I have a different view of what's going on with Amazon
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.680]   than some of the other--
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.760]   I wish Amazon had competition.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.320]   Don't misunderstand me.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.000]   And they do.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.760]   Here's the good news.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.320]   They do.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.480]   There are plenty of places you can buy books online.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.120]   I would really hate to see them become the only game in town.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:08.000]   But I will have to say, Bezos has said and said often
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.480]   that he wants to keep authors happy.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.840]   And everything I have seen so far up to now
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.440]   bears out what he says.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.600]   And you do understand every now and then,
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.960]   he gets a group of science fiction writers together
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.680]   and flies them up to Seattle so he can have dinner with them.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.400]   Well, that's the name.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.760]   So he's kind of sympathetic to the work I do.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.920]   So I start off with a prejudice in his favor.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.520]   I haven't seen too many people at Flash Ad to do that.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.320]   So I'm going to give the counterpoint to that.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.840]   Go ahead.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.120]   Since I'm still--
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:39.600]   Let's hear it.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.640]   --in the story.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.920]   Mike Elgin published this actually
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.400]   great piece on Computer World today, where he called this--
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.280]   he called the Fire Phone, the most effective device ever
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.000]   sold for harvesting the personal data from its owner.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.720]   So this is another one of the things.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:58.040]   And Mike, who obviously you guys all know well--
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.560]   He's our news director.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.720]   He said you should not buy the Fire Phone.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.280]   He did.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.120]   He did.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:10.320]   And so just to bring some balance here, Mike's point
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   is that every time you do Firefly, every time you use
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:21.960]   Firefly, it's uploading images, audio, and GPS coordinates
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.720]   every time.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.680]   And that Amazon is storing that data.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.480]   And that also, because they're looking at--
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.720]   through this 3D feature, they're
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:32.000]   looking at your face all the time to judge
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.400]   if you're looking at your facial angles and things like this.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.040]   They're going to be able to do this amazing thing
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.360]   that we just talked about, and that the facial recognition,
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.520]   potentially, because of all the data
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.400]   they're collecting on that, could be better than anybody
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.600]   has done before, because of that database of facial images,
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.880]   if they were, in fact, storing those
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.600]   and connecting them to a profile on you.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.920]   So on all, Mike's just making a pretty strong argument.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.000]   Then he's bringing in the cloud storage and silk
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.160]   browser and other things.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.640]   And he's saying that this thing is
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.480]   going to have so much data on you.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.680]   Google and Facebook will be jealous in terms
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.720]   of what they're going to have because of some
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.880]   of these features.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.240]   But isn't that inevitable?
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.080]   But is it?
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.760]   I mean, it is inevitable in the sense
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.040]   that this is where all these services are heading.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.280]   But we have such a freak out as a collective society.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.360]   Any time we think our privacy is being invaded,
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.400]   which is interesting, because with all of this information
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.240]   being collected by not just this device,
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.000]   but Amazon's entire existence, why there hasn't been
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.280]   a complete freak out over what Amazon does with big data.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.280]   Jason, not that--
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.320]   Well, that's partly because we've been living with Google
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.480]   for so long, right?
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.840]   Yeah, true.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.760]   What is it they're doing that Google doesn't do now?
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.440]   Well, the--
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.440]   It's inevitable because they're not--
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.680]   Mike's point though is that this phone is even better
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.800]   than any other Android phone for doing this because of Firefly
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.920]   and because it has four cameras on the front face.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.680]   So it's seeing you, it's seeing where you are,
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.360]   and seeing-- in other words, it's an even better data
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:05.880]   collector.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.560]   But they're not doing anything different than Google's.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.800]   No, but Google has been--
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.560]   To Google's credit, they have been getting more and more
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.560]   friends--
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.560]   They've been transparent.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.560]   --parents about what they're doing.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.480]   And that's Mike's complaint.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.560]   And Mike's point-- and I think he's right on--
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:24.200]   is that Amazon is not-- they need to be far more transparent
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.880]   and detailed about what they are collecting, what they are
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.000]   saving, and what their practices are on anonymizing the things
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.240]   or allowing you to opt out and those kind of things, which
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.320]   they currently do not.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.800]   And if they're going to do these kind of things,
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.880]   they have to do it.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.400]   And we should hold their feet to the fire.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:38.880]   But do they?
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.400]   Do they?
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.440]   Because Google--
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.640]   Google sells you.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.800]   Your Google's product.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.440]   You're the thing that-- the data point
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.880]   that they are offering to their advertisers.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.920]   For Amazon, they're really honest.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.680]   I mean, even if we don't know exactly what they're doing
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.480]   with it, we know the purpose.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.040]   The entire purpose of Amazon's existence of all their data
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.080]   collection is to sell you stuff.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:58.560]   That's it.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.760]   And they're very open about that.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.680]   I mean, they're not pretending like they're not
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.520]   selling you that book or that gizmo.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.520]   So maybe that's why we cut them more slack.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.160]   Because even if we don't know the minutiae of what they're
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.120]   doing with that information, we know the final product.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.320]   I think as internet citizens, though, our expectation is
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.720]   becoming and should be that if you are using my data,
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.960]   if you are taking data on me, that you should be transparent
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.040]   about that, you should let me know that, especially
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.080]   on the scale of what places like Google and Facebook
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.000]   and Amazon and Apple are doing.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   And so I think that is a fair point.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.760]   And it's not something that's out there.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.720]   It's not something that should be mandated by law.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.000]   But I think it should be an expectation.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.840]   And I think it's something that as journalists, it's something
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.880]   that we can do to sort of hold people's feet to the fire on it.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:57.360]   Jason, do you use your CVS membership card or your Vons
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.880]   or Safeway or Ralph's grocery store cards
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.920]   to get that little discount they give for being a member?
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:05.640]   Sometimes.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.200]   Some of them, I do.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:07.800]   I buy everything.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.520]   And so they know everything you bought
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.840]   and how much it costs and when you bought it
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:18.800]   and where you bought it, do you think that Walmart doesn't
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.720]   have cameras that see your face while you're buying stuff?
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.320]   But should we accept that, Jerry?
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:31.040]   I mean, it's a little late to stop.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.200]   That's kind of-- by the way, that's kind of Mike's point.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.680]   He said, see, we've never had to think about Amazon
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.720]   in that regard.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.680]   But all of a sudden with his phone, we do.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.200]   And he says, this is quoting Mike's article,
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.600]   one can imagine three years hence when users are more jaded
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.320]   and worn down by massive and constant privacy invasions
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.560]   that Amazon might choose to turn on some killer future face
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.400]   recognition algorithm using those pictures
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.320]   that they've been uploading.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:59.520]   Remember, they're giving you free, unlimited storage
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.520]   for all of your photos in order to compete more effectively
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.360]   against other data harvesting companies.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.000]   So Amazon--
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And this is what he asks.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.920]   He says, he wants-- he says, if Amazon doesn't promise
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.920]   to never do this, then they're just leaving that option open.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.400]   And potential buyers-- and I think this is fair--
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.560]   should be aware of this.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.520]   You may make the choice.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.640]   You may do the deal with the devil, if you'll forgive me,
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.280]   Father.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.840]   But you should understand that Amazon has this potential.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.560]   And if they don't promise never to do it,
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.320]   then they probably-- then they want to assume they might.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.720]   And I am playing devil's advocate here, Jerry.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.840]   But still, I'm just saying that this
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.400]   is reaching a level where it's getting so far down
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.600]   the tracks on some of these things.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.960]   And I just think before it gets too far down the tracks
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.760]   where consumers have completely no--
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.480]   and the regular folks have no awareness of this.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.840]   And it could be used against them in ways
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.200]   that they don't appreciate that it's part of our job
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.600]   to advocate on their behalf.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:05.080]   Amazon has a browser, of course, in the fire,
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.560]   the Silk browser.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.520]   And he points out-- we should have had Mike on the show today,
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.160]   actually.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.120]   He points out that the browser is governed
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.360]   by Amazon's privacy policies, which are pretty upfront,
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.760]   saying, quote, "receive and store any information you
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.520]   enter on our website or give us in any other way."
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.720]   And they say, if you don't like it, exit the browser
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.080]   and do not install user access.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.600]   Amazon, Silk, in other words, we're
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.080]   going to keep track of everything you do.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.160]   And that's the way it is.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.640]   If you don't like it, don't use this browser.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.560]   That's pretty transparent.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.600]   I don't-- do you think Google doesn't--
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.560]   No, of course Google doesn't.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.080]   --have you been doing it for years?
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.560]   Yeah, of course Google has its own browser.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.480]   Chrome, why?
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.560]   Well, guess why?
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.720]   And I doubt that Apple is throwing much data away
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.000]   about what you do.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.720]   We now understand why Apple made Safari.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.280]   It wasn't because we didn't have a good experience.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.360]   It's a different society.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.160]   20 years ago, if someone had had a case where they said, look,
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.440]   I have a right to have all these companies erase their data
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.280]   about me.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.480]   We'd probably say, oh, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.760]   You know, if it's your personal data, they have no right to it.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.800]   We just had that right to be forgotten case.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.000]   And people are looking at it going,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.840]   you don't have that right.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.080]   If you're on the internet, you're in a public space,
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.920]   you don't have the right to tell companies
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.600]   to get rid of the data that you left behind.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.920]   And it just shows you, we are now-- we will accept this.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.520]   As long as you give me something, something shiny,
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.640]   Gmail, a better shopping experience,
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.080]   I will take invasion of privacy as long as I don't think
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.080]   it's too invasive.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.120]   And that two-part shifts, what's too invasive,
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.800]   will shift over the years.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.240]   I mean, it's funny because we have this conversation
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.440]   on nearly every Twitter.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.640]   No matter who the panelists are, there's this clear sense
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.080]   that privacy does no longer exist.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.880]   As Scott McNeely was right, he said privacy is over.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.120]   There is no privacy, get over it.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.840]   And yet there is also this strong feeling
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.520]   we should try to fight for some semblance of privacy.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.880]   And I don't know what the answer is.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.400]   I generally come down on the side of--
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:02.920]   I don't care.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.600]   So what if Google or Amazon knows everything I do?
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.480]   What's the harm in that?
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.880]   Depends on what kind of porn you watch.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.840]   You know what?
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.120]   Everybody watches porn.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.120]   What's so what?
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.560]   I only watch Christian porn.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.160]   Good man.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.480]   I'm sorry, not everybody.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.920]   But many of them.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.000]   I guess I think we're going to head to an age.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:23.440]   Thanks to--
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.840]   Oh, I am sure Father has done his research
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.560]   and the mindfulness of man gone.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.120]   You have to research to know.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.360]   I mean, seriously.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.480]   This is groundbreaking.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.320]   This is so bad.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.520]   I don't want to go this way.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.040]   But I do have to point out that in the Facebook world,
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.880]   the post-Facebook world, notice we
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.160]   have a president who admitted to inhaling,
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.840]   that the standards are changing.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.080]   You're not going to be able to elect
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.320]   a president who hasn't smoked pot or hasn't surfed porn.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.520]   You're not going to be able to hire an employee who hasn't
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.160]   got pictures of him drinking heavily on Facebook.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:59.440]   Because everybody-- what will become apparent is everybody,
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.960]   except with the exception of Father Robert Bowser.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.480]   I was going to say that.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.800]   Everybody does this.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.160]   And so is that a bad thing?
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:10.080]   Maybe-- you know, Jivorek always brings up the--
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:14.040]   I think it's the boogeyman of insurance companies finding out
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.920]   I'm eating too many donuts and refusing to insure me.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.320]   I don't really worry about that so much.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.560]   Well, not only that, but under Obamacare,
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.960]   that's a preexisting condition anyway.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:26.920]   So I'm safe.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.120]   I'm protected.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.040]   Thank you, President Obama.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:38.680]   Well, I think that part of it is the idea that we haven't seen it
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:38.880]   yet.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.960]   The insurance company-- I don't think this is necessarily
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.200]   a boogeyman thing.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.440]   I think that's something to be concerned about.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.160]   Well, I think that if that starts happening,
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.320]   then in fact, legislation will probably do something about it.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:49.840]   It could.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.480]   It could.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.880]   But it certainly could come into--
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.080]   Let's not assume there's going to be harm until it happens.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:55.960]   I agree.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.720]   That's fair enough.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.760]   I think it's just anticipating that this could affect you
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.720]   getting a job.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.280]   Well, and the point is that it is too late.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.320]   But I think it's all right.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.440]   Jerry, is that your position?
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.200]   It's already too late.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.720]   I think that the time to have done this was 20 years ago
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.560]   when I wrote some columns about it,
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.360]   and nobody paid damn better attention to it.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.520]   You've given up.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.680]   What was the threat 20 years ago?
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.240]   This?
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.000]   So this was the earliest early days of the internet.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.440]   You could see it coming.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.160]   Well, before the internet--
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:30.680]   Sure.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:35.880]   --remember, back in 1980, what made me famous,
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.640]   if you can use that word, was that I
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.440]   said that by the year 2000, anybody in Western civilization
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.640]   would be able to get the answer to any question that actually
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.600]   had an answer.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.080]   That's true.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:49.560]   And--
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.200]   It happened.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.760]   --low and behold, it happened by 1995.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.760]   Thanks to Google.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   Nice to go.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:01.440]   And Western civilization changed in 1990,
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.200]   about 1990, when the wall came down.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.880]   So it's now except for China and North Korea
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:15.160]   and a few places that don't have any internet paint.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.960]   Anybody in the world can get almost any answer to it,
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.400]   get answered almost any question that has an answer.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.800]   Well, questions like, when was Leo born
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.040]   and what did he have for dinner last night?
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.520]   Are questions that have an answer?
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.440]   But when did Leo--
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.840]   And anybody who wants to know what you had for dinner last night
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.320]   could find out if they really wanted to know it.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.800]   Should we worry, though-- and this
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   is the right to be forgotten in Europe--
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.520]   but should we worry if somebody queries, how long
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.560]   was Leo's jail term for that rape conviction
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.480]   and they find an incorrect answer?
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.800]   Then what is my recourse?
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.960]   I mean, not all the information's accurate, Jerry,
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.440]   as we well know.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.320]   I understand thoroughly.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.080]   We cover big data all the time on Twite, on my network show.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.120]   Well, I think that the nightmare scenario
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.720]   is when big data goes wrong, because those correlations
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.840]   that it draws inevitably--
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:09.840]   Yes.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.400]   --is it always right?
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.160]   Yes.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.520]   So now what?
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.560]   Is it too loud?
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.080]   It's screwed.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.320]   It's not too many.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.320]   I think it's just expectations.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.480]   No, but legislatures are four is
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.720]   to determine who is responsible when false data is
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.760]   disseminated.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.360]   It is still-- you can still collect for being lobbled,
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.480]   you know.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   But see, that's a problem.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.000]   It's the problem.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.440]   There's many of the people who lobbled.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:39.400]   You don't have enough money to make it worth going after them.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.480]   But, Jerry, that's a problem with false data and big data,
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.320]   because you're not disseminating any falsehoods.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.800]   Big data is based on disparate sets of information
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.360]   that are put through some sort of database.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.560]   So there is no individual.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.040]   There's no corporation that's making the assumption
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.400]   they're just giving you a percentage of possibility
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.240]   based on the information it has.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.760]   Well, I'm not harmed by that.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.040]   I am harmed if it comes up and says
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:07.080]   that I served five years for poisoning children
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:11.400]   when I was 35 years old or something.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   Right.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.400]   Well, what about this--
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.600]   it's just a libel statement.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.280]   OK, so I'll give you an example.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.720]   If you said that people my age and with my background
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:25.160]   have a 4% probability of having molested a kid at some point
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.480]   in time, there's nothing I can do about that.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.600]   That may or may not be a true statement.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:30.120]   Right.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.800]   But if it says that I did it, that's
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.560]   a accusation and a lie.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.520]   And I can do something about that.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.520]   Great quote in our chat room from Bruce Schneier.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.520]   Web7 says, "Brushnier in 2006 wrote, quote,
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.400]   'Patterns we leave behind will be brought back
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.000]   to implicate us by whatever authority has now been focused
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.960]   upon our once private and its next.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.200]   We lose our individuality because everything we do
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.160]   is observable and recordable."
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.040]   I mean, I understand both sides of this argument.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:00.840]   I really do.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.080]   I've decided because I'm too lazy to do anything else
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.000]   just to buy the Amazon phone.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:07.880]   You know?
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:08.840]   Because it's cool.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.920]   And I want it.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:13.800]   Now, what about the judge in Ottawa who has--
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.640]   the Supreme Court actually wasn't in Ottawa.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.320]   The Supreme Court of the British Columbia
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:24.760]   was ruling on a case in which a company, Equist Tech,
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.520]   sued because another company they claimed
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:35.120]   was making programs, data link, that stole Equitex ideas
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:40.000]   and designs and in effect violated their patents.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.320]   The judge has ruled, yes, in fact, this company, DataLink,
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:48.440]   did steal your designs and has informed Google
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:52.960]   that it must pull down all links to DataLink's site,
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.640]   not just in Canada, but they have to kill all the search
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:00.120]   results on all their servers worldwide.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.720]   Now, the judge obviously doesn't have jurisdiction worldwide.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:06.440]   But this is the first time I've ever
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.760]   heard of a national court telling Google,
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:16.040]   you've got to get all the addresses, all the references out,
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:16.880]   not just Google CA.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:22.320]   The judge wrote websites could be generated automatically,
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.640]   resulting in an endless game of whack-a-mole with a plaintiff
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.840]   identifying new URLs and Google deleting them.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.240]   So as a result, Google must kill all DataLink search results
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.480]   worldwide, not just any particular website,
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.240]   but any time you search for Google on Google for DataLink.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.320]   So that's not necessarily--
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.160]   That's not necessarily the individual.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:40.920]   --that's the individual.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.480]   Yes.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.840]   So that won't affect the United States.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.560]   It will, because--
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.680]   Yeah, because they're saying that it could be on all domains,
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.720]   not just Google.ca.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.080]   And I don't know how they could have this jurisdiction.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:00.480]   Google said, if we follow this order,
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.760]   it will put us in conflict with laws in other countries.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   Google is most likely going to appeal.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:15.040]   And Michael Geist, who is a really excellent constitutional
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:19.160]   scholar in Canada, said it seems likely that this will be
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.400]   thrown out.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.640]   He writes, based on earlier Canadian cross-border internet
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.840]   cases, the global order will probably be struck down.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.240]   Quote, this judge has decided she's
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.720]   going to decide for the rest of the world.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.760]   He says, adding that it appears that the judge,
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.560]   seeing the size and power of Google,
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.840]   may have decided that, quote, judges need powers that
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.240]   are equally large if they're going to deal with it.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:43.760]   Thank you.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:50.280]   I'd rather see Google have some of it than depends on the judge.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.960]   I don't find judges always were act in my interest.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.760]   That's right.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.800]   I think we are in a really interesting and--
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.720]   it's a conundrum.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.520]   I don't know what the answer is.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.680]   And I want that phone, so I'm just going to buy it.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.680]   Well, actually, look, all of this discussion
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.160]   leads to what it said, which is--
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.600]   It's cool, I want it.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.600]   And it doesn't matter how much we talk about this.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.120]   We're children.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.600]   Eventually, people will say, it's cool.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.360]   It's shiny.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.040]   Ooh, shiny.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.880]   It's new.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.320]   Yeah, a lot of what we're talking about
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.440]   is kind of future proofing against scenarios
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.200]   in the future that worry us.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:29.000]   And ultimately, I think that the thing is just to--
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.440]   if you want it and you understand what you're given up
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.000]   to do it, then by all means.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.600]   And I think our job is just to push them
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.000]   for more transparency.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.400]   I guess I'm looking to Jerry for the wise, the elder,
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.880]   the wise leader.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.840]   You're the chief of our tribe, Jerry.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.880]   Well--
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:54.760]   Or wise, Satcham, please advise us.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.760]   I think that Jason is absolutely right.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:02.760]   It is our job to warn people that there are consequences
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:07.040]   to having all the pretty things that you want.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:13.400]   But I must say that having been the guy who did that
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:18.520]   for about 30 years and seeing how much result I got from doing
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:21.640]   it, I'm not dead sure it's going to do Jason nuts,
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.680]   but much more good than it did me.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.120]   No fun being Paul Revere.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.080]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.120]   Fair enough.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.280]   Does this, by the way, lead us into net neutrality?
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.720]   Lead us not into evil, but deliver us from net neutrality.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.360]   We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.040]   Thank you, Jerry.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.200]   I'm just you carrying the flag, Jerry.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.560]   I just keep carrying the flag.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.520]   I know Jerry's take on this, but I'm
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.800]   going to give him a chance to say it.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.000]   And everybody else too.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.120]   We got lots to talk about.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.240]   This is a great show.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.320]   So nice to have Jerry Pournell here.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.920]   I mean it when I say he is the elder of our tribe,
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.800]   our fearless leader.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.120]   Also Father Robert Ballisair.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.320]   Great to have you host of this week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:05.360]   Know how in coding 101, the digital Jesuit.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:08.320]   And we got him because of Pope doesn't.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.080]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.080]   Sorry, Francis.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.320]   He's mine.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.400]   And no.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.080]   Anytime Francis wants you, he can have you.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.240]   Because you know what?
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.080]   He's great.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.040]   He's great.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.480]   He may not be alive much longer, but really is he ill?
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:26.200]   No, he took on the mafia.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.560]   Oh dear.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.320]   That's why we love him.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:33.320]   He took on the mafia just after he discarded the bulletproof
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:33.840]   Pope.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.880]   No, no, no.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.920]   This is a fearless man of God, and you got to love him.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.760]   And I'm talking about you.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.960]   I wouldn't take him off you.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:42.960]   No.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:49.240]   And Father Ballisair's case in mind, yes, we've got to love him.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.480]   Well, that's my point.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.480]   Here I am.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:52.480]   It's contractual.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.760]   And the atheist headed straight for damnation.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.400]   And I still love him.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.560]   Jason Hiren is also here from a little fucking tuckier show.
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.480]   It's great to have you, Jason.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.320]   He's the guy who got me elected president of the internet, by the way.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.000]   So props to him.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   Well done.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   Well done, Jason.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.760]   And I'm just going to tell you, Alexis O'Haney, who's running as mayor of the internet, the
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.920]   president Trump's mayor.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.600]   I just want to say, Alexis, although given that Alexis founded Reddit, he certainly has
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.400]   a certain claim to that.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.240]   He's the mayor of a big city on the internet.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.240]   I'll give him the biggest city on the internet.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.240]   There you go.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.240]   There you go.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.240]   Our show today brought you by stamps.com.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.840]   One thing I know you don't want to do is head to the post office to wait in line to buy
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.280]   stamps, but you don't have to.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.560]   The post office approves this message.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.760]   Post office.com turns your PC or your Mac into your personal post office.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.760]   You can buy in print official US postage.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.960]   With your computer and your printer, you do not need special links.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.920]   You do not need a postage meter.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.480]   You could print anything from some stamps to shipping labels.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.840]   You could print right on the envelope.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.760]   In fact, it really looks pro to do that, by the way.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.560]   I always know when I get mailings from people who use stamps.com because they're fulfillment
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.640]   looks great.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.920]   It looks great because you know, your logo, you get the return address printed on there,
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.760]   the address.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.320]   It just slick as heck.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.320]   And you, by the way, you still give a business to the post office.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.520]   Man, man, still comes to your door, picks up the mail.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.440]   In fact, the post office loves you so much.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:22.160]   They'll give you discounts you can't even get at the post office.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.120]   I just drive by the post office.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.400]   I love the post office.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.560]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.720]   I am a big fan of the US Postal Service.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.600]   What they do is amazing.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.000]   I am a huge fan.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.880]   I go by whenever I go by the post office, I wait, but I do not stop.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.000]   I go home to my office and I print.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.840]   And by the way, what I do not love is the postage meter companies.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:50.360]   Postage meter ink is 100 times more expensive than ink jet ink, which is by itself 100 times
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.000]   more expensive than blood.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.040]   Plus postage meter companies will charge you to reset processing fees.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:02.720]   If the stamps go up, you got to pay them to change the rates with stamps.com.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720]   It's simple.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.960]   The rate changes automatically.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.160]   You don't even have to worry about it.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.800]   They always have the right rates.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.440]   I'm going to get you a USB scale so you always have exactly the right postage.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:20.240]   If you are selling on eBay or Etsy, Amazon PayPal, it'll automatically take the information
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:26.800]   from the website, print out the mailing label, send out an email if you're doing a confirmed
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   mail.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.240]   If it's international, they'll fill out the customs for us automatically.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.560]   You don't have to hand write a single thing.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.560]   Postage meter companies will charge you to pay them to buy them.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.560]   They'll charge you to pay them to buy them.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.560]   They'll charge you to pay them to buy them.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.560]   They'll charge you to pay them to buy them.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560]   They'll charge you to pay them to buy them.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.560]   They'll charge you to pay them to buy them.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.560]   They'll charge you to pay them to buy them.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.560]   They'll charge you to pay them to buy them to buy them.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560]   They'll charge you to pay them to buy them to buy them.

[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:29.560]   to buy them to buy them to buy them to buy them to buy them to buy them
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.560]   At least it's sensitive to the issue
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.560]   I'm going with Jerry on the inevitability of all these kinds of things
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.560]   but still I agree that not playing Devil's Advocate
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:45.560]   any longer on some of the privacy stuff
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:49.560]   I agree it's a smart move and it's going to be an important part
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.560]   I think this is an important aspect of the smart home
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.560]   and if Google wants to do that and go
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.560]   and buy it then you know and obviously they do with the nest
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:05.560]   purchase then that's got to be part of the equation too
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:09.560]   and so I think it's a smart buy I think getting them before somebody else
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.560]   did you know helps Google helps nest
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.560]   I want to see Amazon buy a company like this and combine it with firefly
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.560]   so they can tell you what you can buy from around your house
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.560]   we know you don't have a tablet
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.560]   you know you like that flat where we can get you more
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.560]   really ugly dress your kid just dropped a plate let's go order for more
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.560]   when you call that tech support number you know and you tell them they say okay we need you to restart your computer
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:37.560]   and you say okay it's done now and they say oh no we just saw you on your camera
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:37.560]   you're going to move you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:07:07.560]   you didn't move you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't know you didn't
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.560]   and you know we're going to see a lot of wearables
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.560]   they know iWatch is coming and I'll try to talk about that
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.560]   kind of last chance is that what you're saying last chance it is this is their chance to try to put a stake in the ground
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.560]   and you know get people to realize that they're in this game too and that they're you know going to be big into it
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.560]   and so I think we're going to see a lot of wearables we have somebody there Connor Forrest
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:31.560]   one of our reporters is going to be there all week and you know of course
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:35.560]   CNET and ZEET will be covering it as well but
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:41.560]   we get you know somebody father in the chat room actually made a very good point given that Google will have a camera in their bedroom
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.560]   if you now those Viagra ads have new meaning
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.560]   oh Chad was saying oh we noticed your low on toilet paper
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.560]   our camera in your bathroom notice that
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.560]   the toilet paper was in a little trouble last night and we like we have a solution
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.560]   combined that with Amazon drones and now they can just drop cameras everywhere
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.560]   our share cam notice that you need some more shampoo from now on you're stuck in the toilet
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.560]   in the toilet with no toilet paper you just go a little help Google a little help here and a few minutes later
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.560]   and then we notice you have nothing to read when you're on the toilet
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:15.560]   in your bathroom with a roll of toilet paper yeah
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:23.560]   see there is a benefit to this I'm just saying and meanwhile the gizmo has looked into your bedroom cabinet drawer and decided
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:29.560]   that you're going to need to take a trip to the drug store because you're running out of those things exactly
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.560]   so we can automatically order it for you like what sees
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.560]   once you notice that my toilet paper is down you know to a certain number of rolls
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.560]   just automatically you know ship it to me say how many years have we been talking about that
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:45.560]   I guess goes back to Comdex the refrigerator that orders more milk
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:49.560]   automatically for you because it sees you're out
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.560]   I don't know if the world's ready for that let's talk wearables because you brought it up Jason I think it's a very interesting
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.560]   subject
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.560]   Apple has never said it's doing an eye watch never said it
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.560]   and yet the entire world is gearing up for Apple to do an eye watch
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.560]   how long were we waiting for a tablet though right how many years did we conjecture
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:13.560]   and talk about it at least two years pretty pretty heavily before the iPad was released don't you agree
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:19.560]   and then you know your analogy is actually pretty apt because 10 years before the iPad Microsoft was pushing tablets
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.560]   10 years before the iWatch Microsoft's been pushing this
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.560]   remember this spot watch?
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.560]   spot watch I had one it was this big
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.560]   this is that big
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.560]   it's a huge
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:33.560]   that was long enough ago the people still wore watches I don't know if the world
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.560]   well let me see I see a watch okay one person two watches yeah
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.560]   yeah it's funny glass get out of here
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.560]   it's CES it worries got one
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.560]   there Jerry's got one it dinner CES one of the dinners at CES
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.560]   that I was at I was sitting next to the CEO of pebble
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.560]   really smart great guy and he said to me our biggest competitor isn't
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.560]   Sony or Samsung who've been doing a lot of smart watches too and really trying to compete with them
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   he said our biggest competitor is people not wearing watches
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.560]   right and I think he's exactly right exactly right
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:09.560]   I've tried everyone in fact I'm wearing a galaxy gear to I'm gonna review it on
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:13.560]   they don't call it galaxy Samsung gear to I'm gonna review it on before you buy on Tuesday
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.560]   and I've tried them all the basis the Fitbit the flex the
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.560]   fuel band everyone of them and they're
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.560]   not I'm quite there the pebble Chad's got my pebble
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.560]   there's two categories two ways to go one is health and one is phone extension
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.560]   the pebble is all phone extension Fitbit's all health I can imagine apple might
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.560]   unify the two but I think this is a tough category Jerry what
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:41.560]   do you what do you think from your perspective I mean you've watched categories come and go
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.360]   it's pretty clear now tech companies I've gotten the point where they're just trying to predict what's next
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:50.360]   because they want to be there before we get there right well
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.360]   fold in the nanotech people who could put lithograph your
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.360]   watch on to your wrist if they wanted to how close your
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.360]   medicine like that make it waterproof and and stay on there I'm not so
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.360]   sure but it would powered by your body chemistry
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:12.360]   heat and they could do that now really it costs a bit
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.360]   it would cost something right now but if they thought there was a big market for
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:22.360]   them it probably I will tell you that within 20 years you'll be able to buy that as an app for your phone
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:28.360]   it strikes me that wearables that that's part of the challenge is that anything we talk about whether it's glass
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.360]   a watch they're cumbersome they're uncomfortable
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.360]   we want the functionality but we don't want to give up
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.360]   the we don't want to look like dorks when we don't want to have to wear stuff that's why I only use
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360]   a sundial that thing is cool
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.360]   I would I mean I don't know as maybe if it's
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.360]   subcutaneous and shines through my skin then I can keep it dry
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.360]   now the special sauce has been writing stories
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.360]   in which without there being part of the plot they're just there
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.360]   people have their watches tattooed on their wrist for 30 years
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.360]   yeah that seems sensible
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.360]   wearables clearly we would love to be
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.360]   more intimately connected the thing is I think we can't forget is that
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:18.360]   the computers basically become the device in your pocket I mean we are pretty intimately connected with our computer now
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.360]   it's more personal than ever was
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.360]   the most personal computer ever
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.360]   ever released I mean it is
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.360]   so are these companies trying to move us too fast in their desperation to be
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.360]   to find out what's next
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.360]   are they overthinking this?
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.360]   no I think they're trying to make technology the whole thing about wearables
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.360]   is making technology disappear into the background more making technology
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:48.360]   become more human making it become less of you staring at a screen all the time
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.360]   and I think that's an admirable goal I just think the execution has never been right yet
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.360]   right and we're you know hopefully
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.360]   between Google and you know it's wearable API and
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:06.360]   the stuff it's going to talk about next week and then Apple you know probably most likely in the fall when we
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.360]   you know could hear about iWatch
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.360]   if the product is ready yet then
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   you know hopefully we're a step closer it's still going to be pretty rudimentary
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   but I think we're ready for the next step I think all of us are ready
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.360]   certainly all of us are ready we'll see if sort of the more of the masses are ready
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.360]   to sort of try some of these things and see if they can you know take some of this technology to make it more
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:34.360]   fade into the background and be more human and less of people staring at little pieces of screens
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.360]   or bigger screens on it Jason I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't want to interrupt
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.360]   GO!
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.360]   OK I'm sorry we had to get that out excellent
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:48.360]   1-1? Yeah the Spaniards love that
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.360]   where's the vousillis?
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.360]   yeah
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.360]   uhh uhh uhh
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.360]   what?
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:00.360]   that sounds not good at all that's that's bad
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.360]   it was on drones are gonna take you out dude
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.360]   that was my best material too
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.360]   I'm really sorry rewind rewind
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.360]   but Andrew OK so Google has already announced Android Wear
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.360]   Motorola said yeah we're gonna do a watch LG I think that the thinking is LG is gonna have a watch
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.360]   at I/O this week and they'll probably give everybody who's at I/O
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:29.360]   I kind of say this stuff is crap I cannot get excited about it I've worn every watch
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   every time I wear a watch it's disappointing
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.360]   well doesn't it feel like I step backwards?
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.360]   I've removed stuff from my wrist I don't want to clamp something back on
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:40.360]   but Jerry remembers that's how tablets were when Microsoft was pitching them to us
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.360]   true way back when actually Jerry you like your you always talk about your HP tab
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.360]   I liked mine
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.360]   you were the only one
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.360]   I didn't like it
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.360]   I didn't like handwriting which it didn't understand yours
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:58.360]   Jerry's told this story before but what they what tell them how did that happen?
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:03.360]   well I went to Moscow in the late 80s
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.360]   when it was still the Soviet Union and Stepan Panovich of Paragraph
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.360]   was writing the handwriting recognition software
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.360]   that eventually went into the Microsoft tablets
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:21.360]   and he didn't have any examples of American handwriting
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.360]   so I took out my logbook
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.360]   and I showed him
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.360]   and you still do that?
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.360]   you log everything you do?
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   that's what paper looks like
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:38.360]   he's iroxed about 50 pages of that
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:44.360]   so if it's gonna understand anybody's handwriting it's gonna understand mine
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.360]   I love it, I love it
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.360]   so that's why I like them
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.360]   I want to point out something to you that you seem to have forgotten
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.360]   uh oh
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.360]   Moore's law is inexorable
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360]   yes
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:02.360]   the microprobe people
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:08.360]   are up to something like a couple of thousand channels
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:12.360]   of information on a probe to your head
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.360]   wow they have a doubling time of under seven years
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.360]   and I suspect that's gonna go down more and more
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.360]   when you get to the part where it's 10 to the 10th
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.360]   channels of information that they can do unapprusively
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.360]   with maybe one little plump in your head
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:36.360]   why do you need any to wear anything?
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.360]   why doesn't the computer just talk to your brain?
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.360]   so is this all a rehearsal for jacking in?
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.360]   something of that short
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.360]   I have been writing about
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.360]   rehearsing that for years
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.360]   where you think at the computer
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.360]   for many years
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.360]   and sitting there in that
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.360]   nanotech conference last year
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:03.360]   I come to the conclusion that by gum gollies
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:07.360]   it's coming, I probably won't live to see it but you may
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.360]   I love that idea
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.360]   I do, I want that to happen
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.360]   and every science fiction novel that I love the most has some feature
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   of that kind of
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   good, it would love Star Swarm then
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.360]   now this is your young adult one right?
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.360]   yes it's well it's young adult characters
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.360]   the story is probably adult but yes
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.360]   and of course Othefilty was a
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.360]   but was an early attempt at what happened if you have a human man
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.360]   machine interface like that
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.360]   that worked so the fact that so much science fiction
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.360]   talks about that does that say this is what we secretly hope
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.360]   and desire? I mean you know more intimately than anybody
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360]   the process of science fiction
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:53.360]   when you start seeing something just turn up all the time in science fiction
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.360]   what does that mean?
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.360]   it means it's selling
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.360]   [laughter]
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.360]   general populace like stories that have that in it
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.360]   okay that's fair
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.360]   Samuel Johnson said it very well
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.360]   no man ever wrote
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:13.360]   if no one but a blockhead ever wrote for anything except money
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.360]   [laughter]
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.360]   it's too arduous
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360]   it's too arduous
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.360]   I'm here to make an 11 out of that guarantee
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.360]   that's what we have for you tonight, great I love it
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.360]   and yet I do feel like
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.360]   I don't want to get too airy fairy but
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.360]   there somebody used the word zeitgeist that there's something in the air
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:35.360]   that you start just to see and maybe it is that feedback loop between an audience
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.400]   and a writer where the audience says yeah we like that more of that
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.400]   and so there's definitely this desire for
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.400]   a human machine interface
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   but until the 90s there was no
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   it was just fiction
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.400]   it's just fiction.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.400]   realistically expected it to happen very soon
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:58.400]   when we wrote oath of fealty in the 70s
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.400]   80s everybody you know I had people thinking at their machines
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.400]   and everybody thought that was kind of goofy
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.400]   nowadays nobody thinks that's goofy
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:09.440]   they think it isn't here yet but they don't think it's goofy
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.440]   and when you're starting about 10 to the 10th
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.440]   channels of information
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:17.440]   going from your head to outside and outside to end your head
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:21.440]   then you are now talking about a fair amount of
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:25.440]   capability of simulating your brain in a computer
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:29.440]   yeah I don't think I can think at you and you understand it
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.440]   I think you and I each
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:37.440]   out 4 billion of us on this earth have our own
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.440]   internal language but I think we are getting to the point
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.440]   where a computer can
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.440]   listen can read and write Leo so to speak and it can read and write
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.440]   Jerry and then it can have those two talk to each other within it
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.440]   if you say what I'm getting yes so you know it's funny
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.440]   that would look like telepathy it would look very like telepathy
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.440]   it wouldn't be telepathy but it would look like telepathy
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.440]   it would require the hardware intervention on the other hand
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:13.440]   I point out to you something I said to the to the nanotech conference
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:17.440]   a couple of weeks ago by they they say what's going to be going on in
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.440]   2034 and there will one thing that's going to be going on in 2034
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:25.440]   one thing that's going to be going on in 2034 is that
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.440]   whatever you're carrying around with you
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.440]   for a telephone will be more powerful than the most
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:37.440]   powerful computer on this earth that's right now
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.440]   and that includes Watson and Big Blue
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.440]   and it will have terabytes of information on it
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.440]   on it internal to it as well as connected to the cloud
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.440]   but you'll have Watson in your pocket and you'll be the most formidable
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.440]   competitor on on jeopardy there
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.440]   of a world except that the other people will have them too
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.440]   I love that I know the other way with the zeitgeist
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.440]   when I was growing up the the dream of sci-fi was this idea of being connected
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.440]   to a massive network where you could instantly recall up any information that you needed
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.440]   whatsoever we're there right now what I said would happen in 1980
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:21.440]   exactly but I mean if we look at the trend right now the trend is not
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.440]   too crazy powerful more powerful machines in our pockets
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.440]   we've already got that the the trend is going back to the old mainframe
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:33.440]   days where we we are now with ubiquitous
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.440]   connectivity able to tap into a central repository
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.440]   of data a central repository of computing power it doesn't matter
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:45.440]   it's going to be free it's inevitable more law is inexorable
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   and it's going to continue well even more said it wasn't
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.440]   it wasn't going to continue well at some point you know the quantum
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.440]   you get to the quantum right here you understand Moore's law was a had to do with
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.440]   how many transistors you could get on a chip and that's not
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:05.440]   really what it is but the information technology
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.440]   has for years been basically that
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:13.440]   every two years it either gets twice as powerful or half as expensive
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:17.440]   and sometimes both right and it's been going that way
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.440]   and it has very little to do with the number of chips you can put on
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:25.440]   the number of transistors you can put on a chip
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.440]   a lot of other things happened so more in terms of
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.440]   it's more a spiritual thing it's an idea and a principle of Moore's law rather than
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:37.440]   the sort of actual chip number we just I would have been saying it was law
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:41.440]   as a shorthand right yeah I would have been skeptical
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.440]   it's funny I would have been skeptical about this the
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   interface thing a little bit more if I hadn't over the past few weeks
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.440]   I've been working on this story it's about some of the early
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.440]   people working early days at Apple it's a long-form story that's coming out next month
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:01.440]   I can't wait that's great yeah it's fun stuff but the cool
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.440]   thing that the realization that I've come to is talking
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:09.440]   to them about some of the early work they did and the things they were actually working on the
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.440]   the things they were the problems they were trying to solve and accomplish and they compared
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.440]   with what we're doing now you know 30
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.440]   35 years later 30 almost 40 years later
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.440]   it's a staggering how far we've come I mean
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.440]   I look at this stuff and I'm so blown away in talking to
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.440]   even people that were working on technology in the 70s and in their blown away
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.440]   the stuff they're working on you know they're even so excited about and
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:41.440]   you know we're looking at how far we've come in such a
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:45.440]   what is relatively short period of time it
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.440]   really is quite staggering and so because of that
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.440]   if we can come that far and what we're doing is essentially
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.440]   accelerating and building upon what we're doing
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.440]   I don't know I think there's a lot of things that we're going to solve in the next 30 to 40 years
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.440]   that you know we're going to blow us away and that's why I don't
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.440]   care about giving them my personal information it's worth it
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:13.440]   because we're going to get all this cool stuff because it's shiny yeah although I have to say the more
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:17.440]   the more I talk to people and I see more and more people talking about this the more I worry
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:21.440]   about artificial intelligence and and the machines taken over but that's a
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:25.440]   conversation for another time well go ahead Jerry
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.440]   artificial intelligence is not a natural outcome of
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.440]   somebody gets to once that I happen if you were talking about
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.440]   building self-replicated machines that are
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.440]   then allowed to evolve on Lamarckian
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.440]   rather than Mendelian evolution
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.440]   but aren't we kind of doing that right now?
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.440]   no Elon Musk says
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.440]   and I think he's not alone because we've interviewed a number of people on triangulation
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:59.440]   and elsewhere says he's very concerned that we
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.440]   are creating machines that are smarter than us
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.440]   oh it has happened and could be
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:15.440]   you broke me but I like to think we're still smart enough not to do that
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.440]   yeah if we can figure out a way not to yeah
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.440]   Jeff Hawkins has to say plugged into the wall
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:27.440]   yeah right no batteries
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.440]   and no collecting power from the
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.440]   in a worthy air more than that
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.440]   self-replicating machinery is a
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.440]   is a fairly dangerous land that that's what Jeff Hawkins said to me
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.440]   that's exactly what he said he said you can do anything you want just don't let it replicate
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.440]   we're back to the great deal
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.440]   you know NASA had this conference
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:49.440]   on
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.440]   as Jerry you're breaking up
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:54.440]   can you can I we're gonna call you right back I'm gonna do an ad we're gonna call
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.440]   Jerry back and get him on while we do that
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.440]   all that thought

[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:42.440]   we call Jerry back looks good
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.440]   I think maybe you just had a bandwidth degradation or something I don't know what happened there
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:50.440]   anyway you're saying something about NASA?
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.440]   well we had they had a conference at Bajaro Dunes it was run by the
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:00.440]   University of Santa Clara and it was on self-replicating machinery in space
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:06.440]   the notion was you send something up to space and it makes a factory and the factory makes robots
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:10.440]   and robots make more factories and factories make more robots
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.440]   and could you do that then you can either harvest factories or harvest robots
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:18.440]   and can you do that?
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:22.440]   with the technology of the time you couldn't do it
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.440]   I'm not sure I don't think you can now either you can't quite close that loop
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.440]   but one of the things to observe was if you could do it
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:34.440]   then how many years would it take before
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.440]   every star in the universe which is
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:44.440]   billions of course will have been visited and that turns out to be only a few million years
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:49.440]   which is a pretty short period of time given the number of years since the
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:54.440]   universe was formed it's kind of like Fermi's question where are they
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:30:00.440]   where are the probes? why is none? and menski came up with this he said maybe that's the
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:06.440]   one rule in the galactic civilization if you build a self-replicating machine and send it out
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:10.440]   we come in and blow your planet out that is the one thing thou shalt not do
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:14.440]   Marvin and I were roommates at that conference and we had a lot of fun
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.440]   oh I must I'd like to have been a fly on the wall for that
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.440]   we send amazon at them and it's all over
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:25.440]   thou shalt not build a phone that can gather all the information in the universe
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.440]   or we're going to have to destroy your planet so we'll see Google I always coming up
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:34.440]   we're going to cover their keynote live starts at 9am
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:38.440]   actually mike elgan has the details on the week ahead mike when is that event?
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:42.440]   pause pause coming up this week Google's big event
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:46.440]   Google I/O kicks off Wednesday June 25th both Jason and I will be at the event
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:50.440]   Leo is going to host a special tech news today Wednesday at 9am Pacific
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:54.440]   noon eastern to cover the keynote live also we're expecting Microsoft to roll out
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:58.440]   its first ever android phone the next generation Nokia X on Tuesday
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:02.440]   June 24th that's what's coming up this week back to you Leo thank you mike
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.440]   elgan news director and host of tech news tonight Monday through Friday 10am Pacific
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:10.440]   1pm eastern times 1700 UTC for your morning tech news
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:14.440]   on Twitter wait a minute should I
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:20.440]   do we need to are they going to call it back are they going to call it back I don't see
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.440]   it seems like it's time to say
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:52.440]   no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:58.440]   cause they know the Z-steps how far away the head is they can tell the chair bed is way too small
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:02.440]   given its distance that's wrong
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:08.440]   hold your foot in front of your phone we'll get you the right shoes on tech news today
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:12.440]   I do think we're going to see a lot of smart watches everywhere we're going to see a lot of companies trying to get into this market
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:18.440]   we're going to see a lot of junk this week in law in spite of using these free licenses I get permission requests all the time
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:24.440]   the issue is licenses there's no license that's going to solve the problem the issue is permission cultures
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:30.440]   triagulation joining me right now is the author of this book console wars like Jay Harris
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:36.440]   and as he says the battle that shaped a generation at least the first half of the dub is a David and Goliath story with Sega
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:42.440]   trying to slay the feast at five years earlier Nintendo was their own David and Goliath story to it
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:46.440]   rack him up this is something from a childhood cramp
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.440]   oh my god
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.440]   oh
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:57.440]   we have Jeff Jeff Dean is our newest employee apparently beating up on Chad I think you are the two youngest people in the building though right
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:04.440]   possibly yeah that are the interns yeah aside from the interns yeah what did you slugging back
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:10.440]   well uh not we have extra footage that was compiled by Anthony so here's a
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.440]   little
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.440]   that's a good hit
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.440]   that's like
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.440]   that's like Ali Norton what's like you're supposed to go in the middle of
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.440]   these might you're gonna hit
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:28.440]   okay okay I don't think Jeff likes you Chad yeah he's uh
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:34.440]   Chad's wearing a helmet by the way that's a helmet from the Los Angeles tactical squad
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:38.440]   bulletproof bulletproof helmet but he hit you in the jaw not quite soccer bubble proof
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.440]   yeah unbelievable
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:46.440]   don't miss the giz whiz that's a great show Chad Johnson and of course our good friend
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.440]   Dicty we are to do you're gonna do that on Thursday starting this week next week
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.440]   I'm not sure not we don't know yet we don't know yet who knows what
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:58.440]   oh I'm sorry that's super secret
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:02.440]   first rule about giz whiz is you do not talk about giz whiz
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440]   sorry
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:08.440]   so Patrick Leahy
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:12.440]   uh and uh Congresswoman Matsui have introduced
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:16.440]   landmark net neutrality legislation I'm opening the door here
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.440]   for Jerry Pournell
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:22.440]   uh as you know the Federal Communications Commission is debating this whole thing
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:26.440]   and they've been told by the courts that they don't have the jurisdiction to ensure
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.440]   net neutrality so a lot of us are calling for them
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.440]   to enforce section two of the telecommunications act
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:38.440]   which would say declare basically broadband providers to be telecommunications
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:42.440]   companies and uh regulated by the FCC
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:46.440]   maybe the solution is this bill the online competition
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.440]   and consumer choice act which would do the most important thing the thing where most
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:54.440]   worried the FCC will approve paid prioritization deals
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.440]   the internet service providers would go to companies like Netflix
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:02.440]   or Google or YouTube or Twit and say if you would if you
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:06.440]   if you would like to have high speed internet delivered to our customers you would give us extra
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:10.440]   money so we could have a faster connection
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.440]   uh and they want to make this illegal the online competition
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:18.440]   and consumer choice act would prevent the creation they say of a two-tiered
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:22.440]   internet system Al Franken co-sponsor Henry Waxman
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.440]   of California and an issue of California all original co-sponsors
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.440]   Waxman and the issue both have a constituent season silicon valley so they obviously
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.440]   have some interest in this Waxman's not in silicon
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.440]   oh he's in LA he's your guy that's right yeah
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:40.440]   yeah issue is in silicon valley so what do you think is this the right way to
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:44.440]   okay I'll let you hold on Jerry we'll let Jason say something and then Jerry
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:48.440]   you can wait so good because I'm not just gonna take his side here I'm just
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:52.440]   gonna set the scene a little bit into this this thing this net neutrality thing
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:56.440]   is really starting to line up kind of like healthcare
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.440]   and immigration in that most of us agree
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.440]   in the principles of what needs to happen
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:08.440]   the thing that we can't agree on is how do we
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:12.440]   how do we get there because when and how do we accomplish
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:16.440]   the goals in the case of net neutrality is the goal being sort of the free
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.440]   and open internet right or at least
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.440]   or at least a sort of free fair open internet
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.440]   the problem is in enacting legislation
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:32.440]   or legislating it and trying to legislate those solutions
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:36.440]   there are going to be winners and there are going to be losers and there are going to be unintended consequences
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:40.440]   and that's what everybody's I think scared of
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.440]   and can't necessarily see what the
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:48.440]   results of all of those things are going to be and that's why we can't
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.440]   come to consensus about what we
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:56.440]   should do more not so much what we should do but how we should do it
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.440]   how we accomplish it and that's the challenge you know with net neutrality
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.440]   and I think that it's one of those things
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.440]   I don't know I don't this doesn't feel any closer than anything else that we've
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:12.440]   talked about over the last couple years
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:16.440]   you know one of the things that I've seen over the last couple of weeks talking
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:20.440]   about net neutrality is essentially what it's boiling down
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.440]   for the telcos is they'd like us to trust them we saw this when AT&T
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.440]   put forward their proposal to buy dish or it's our direct
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:32.440]   TV where they they basically told the FCC look look look we promise
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.440]   I mean we're not going to give you any actual written promises but we promise
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.440]   that this is going to be good for the consumer to it yeah we won't tell you how but this is going to be good
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:44.440]   and trust us yeah they've got no store they've got no reservoir
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:48.440]   of trust now all right Jerry you and I agree on
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:52.440]   one thing a deep abiding fear of government
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:56.440]   regulation on the internet the internet has grown without government interference and
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:00.440]   and my fear is that if we don't protect it
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:04.440]   that the telecoms and the broadband providers are going to screw us
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.440]   so so basically how do we solve this
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:12.440]   if I don't require if if if
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:16.440]   I get to subsidize your your porn downloads
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:20.440]   is that basically it you don't have to pay extra because you're using it
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.440]   and up more and more I'm already paying I'm already paying
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.440]   I pay for my analysis yes or you
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:32.440]   but why should the porn company have to I mean you want to solve the problem
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:36.440]   I'll give it to you quickly yes enforce the Sherman Anti-Trust Act
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:40.440]   against against
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.440]   all of these dang companies there is not you should not have any
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:48.440]   companies that buying each other out at the levels that they are at
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.440]   so the and I'd agree with you the lack of competition is what put us in this position
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.440]   the lack of competition is the only thing you have to worry about so
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:00.440]   if you give the government a monopoly it's still a bloody monopoly
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.440]   that's a good point too yeah so
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:08.440]   you're worried about something that isn't a problem yet
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.440]   and doesn't look like it's going to be because bandwidth keeps getting developed
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.440]   a lot faster than the ability to use it to begin with
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.440]   I mean I used to get net slowdowns a heck of a lot
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.440]   more a few years ago than I do now you just had to
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:28.440]   turn me off and recall me because we got a slow down
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.440]   on Skype right but it was all free and it happened
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:36.440]   quickly I just don't see what it is that you want
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:40.440]   why is it you want to give the FCC geniuses
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.440]   the power to tell you what you can and can't have no I
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:48.440]   I've actually come around to the idea that enforcing section 2 is probably
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.440]   a bad idea because that just gives the FCC a lot more
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.440]   to regulate but do you think this bill is a good
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:00.440]   idea I think that their bill is a horrible
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:04.440]   idea what I would like to see is a
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:08.440]   revision of the Sherman Ant-I-Trust Act that makes it very clear
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:12.440]   that we are not going to have companies that are too big to fail
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:16.440]   right yeah because it's exactly true
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:20.440]   and when the I think any legislation
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:24.440]   almost always in the US the US is much more on the side
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:28.440]   of businesses especially big businesses than it is on consumers
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:32.440]   typically so any legislation my concern is
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:36.440]   any legislation that gets enacted the unintended consequences
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.440]   is that it helps the Comcast and the Verizon's
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:44.440]   and the you know time-warners of the world and if Comcast matches the time-warner
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.440]   they come fresh and close to being a monopoly can I just point out one
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:52.440]   unintended consequence that it keeps people from entering
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.440]   into the competitive field and Smith said it was a very long
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:00.440]   time ago whenever two capitalists get together
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:04.440]   they plot to see how government can keep somebody else from competing with
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:10.440]   the two of them fair enough true you have a lot of regulations and nobody
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:14.440]   can start a startup because he has to have nine
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:18.440]   compliance officers own staff before he can make a product
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.440]   yeah and he ain't got that capitalist don't want to pay for compliance
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:28.440]   officers so you don't get startups I mean it could really all of this stuff
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:32.440]   you're talking about net neutrality is really a conspiracy against
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.440]   startups oh I'm gonna have to
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:40.440]   I'm gonna have to think about that yeah hold on I love that quote
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:44.440]   all right I'm not convinced of that Jerry I mean I do agree
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.440]   if you ever well it will be an inevitable so-called
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.440]   unintended con consequence what I'm telling you is
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.440]   it isn't unintended right yeah fair enough
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.440]   Supreme Court has done something for us
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:04.440]   in the battle against patent trolls on Thursday morning they ruled
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.440]   unanimously to dismiss a patent awarded to an Australian company
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.440]   for business software
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:17.440]   yeah who raw we get the court wrote we conclude that the method claims which merely
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.440]   require generic computer implementation
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:25.440]   failed a term form that abstract idea into a patent
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:29.440]   eligible invention Justice Clarence Thomas writing the
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:35.440]   majority opinion a unanimous opinion now this is important because software patents
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:40.440]   the door was open to software patents when the court ruled that
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:44.440]   a process a computer program used to vulcanize rubber
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.440]   was patentable first time ever because it controlled a machine
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:54.440]   and they said well that is an implementation because it's controlling a machine
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:57.440]   that did open the door for software patents and of course we see a lot of very
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:01.440]   generic patents that control no physical machine
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.440]   their thing like their things like patenting the slide to unlock
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.440]   things that would in the past have been copyrighted or trademarked but not patented
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:14.440]   so double click and now my job yeah that's ridiculous yeah so single
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:18.440]   the single click patent single click yeah by with one click
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:23.440]   that's not a patentable idea so it didn't take
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:28.440]   any bloody genius to figure that one out no it's not all patent roles are not
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:33.440]   over because of course as often happens with a decision like this now the lower
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:37.440]   courts are going to have to decide well what is what is a generic computer
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:42.440]   implementation what is a what is a physical implementation you know and and
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:47.440]   that's gonna there's gonna be a lot of question marks judge Sotomayor wrote a
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:52.440]   concurring opinion that said no business method should ever be patentable
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:59.440]   that that's getting a little close closer to the idea but the question is still
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:04.440]   open about whether software itself could be patented but this is a big I think
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:09.440]   a good step in the right direction I don't know what the upshot will be
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.440]   with the USPTO but I thought we'd mention that yeah but on the other side
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:19.440]   you still have the USPTO handing out a copyright for pie in January of this year
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.160]   not apple pie no just pie like they were able to get a copyright on pie the
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:27.560]   symbol for pie because obviously there's no prior art for that oh my god you
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.960]   still have Oracle who is they've they've got a new wind in their lawsuit against
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:40.120]   Google's use of their of their API APIs so this is one little ruling I know
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:47.200]   but I don't know I don't see it propagating or Jerry I think Comcast
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.280]   decided he shouldn't be able to use no no I think that was the nanotech
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:58.080]   mmm my band come conspiracy between the two let's take a break if we come back we
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:02.760]   hope Jerry will as well are sure they just tied it up I think they just
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:06.400]   equalized it there's only there's only 30 seconds left in the game they they
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:10.520]   tied it up they just tied it up there's only 30 seconds left in the game that's
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:14.940]   a terrible thing terrible thing actually I'm glad because we have many
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:24.240]   Portuguese viewers and this way everybody wins no no no no so now you suck on the
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:33.720]   vuvuzela yeah can I inhale no doesn't really produce the sound doesn't know
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:39.520]   our show today brought to you thank God there's backup can we back up this
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:44.760]   game oh carbon I online backup whether you have one computer at home or
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:48.140]   several at your business the worst thing that can happen is you lose data I had a
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:52.660]   guy call me he said my hard drive fell off a table on the ratio show today my
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:56.380]   hard drive fell off a table now I can't get into it I he said I priced it's
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:59.700]   could cost me thousands of dollars to get my data off this drive I said did you
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:03.380]   have a backup he said it was the backup said but if it's the only copy it's not
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:10.980]   a backup just because you put stuff on your backup drive does not mean you have
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:14.500]   a backup you have one copy of your data you're gonna lose your data eventually
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:18.760]   carbon I does it exactly right if you're a business and you're letting Jerry in
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:22.400]   this stockroom backup your computers whenever he remembers to do it and he's
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.540]   backing them up on a hard drive he keeps in the stockroom what if the whole thing

[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.760]   mock but actually I think this is a you you've played with it I have played with
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:41.600]   it it's it's a nice machine yeah you're using an a sir S7 I'm using an
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:46.520]   a sir I use that to I love it which kind of leads me to then and like this is
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:49.560]   what I would take over a surface three I like the surface three if I was gonna
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.800]   use a Windows tablet that's definitely the tablet I would use but I want my
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.720]   laptop there was a question and I don't know if they fixed this there were some
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:02.520]   really if you got their father that's oh this is a sir I love it highly
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:05.720]   recommended Jerry I know you're looking for your who is this for your niece your
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:10.100]   granddaughter well I'm that but I'm also it's time to replace my old thank
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:14.200]   pad I think the think pads are still pretty darn good in fact the carbon
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:21.760]   X-1 touch yeah amazing four-year-old one right uh-huh what do you like Jason
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:28.800]   for a tablet or for any like it does he doesn't like that was he's like me I
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.360]   I yeah I just cannot I wrote this article you know when the iPad first came out
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.280]   the iPads only good for two things you know reading and scrabble um it's
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.720]   really good for scrabble though I gotta say it is excellent I can remember when
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:45.240]   I was playing words with friends on the iPhone the iPad hadn't come out yet and
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:50.520]   I dreamed I dreamed of having 10 inches I've I'm dreaming about that a lot but
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:57.240]   that and the idea of being able to play scrabble yeah and it is really the
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:02.000]   words with friends machine amazing amazing amazing but basically you can
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.760]   boil that down to like you know gaming and viewing content right that's like
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.800]   the two things tablets are good for I kind of thought that all along I know
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:12.600]   people say oh I can create content blah blah blah but I still feel that way I
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:16.840]   just can't I'm sort of I'm sort of with Robert like give me it give me a laptop
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.240]   give me a really good laptop thin light long battery life and you know and
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:25.720]   then I've got a great phone and I'm happy camper um I do feel like we are as
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.720]   a who was it said we were in the post post PC era where the phone is really
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:33.840]   90% of the computing I do well I mean that that's a thing I mean I my phone is
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:37.160]   a big enough screen where that's my tablet I don't feel like I need a tablet
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:41.120]   in addition to my phone and when I want to go one step up it's my laptop exactly
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.560]   it's not to another I don't need that in between device by the way I just want
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:48.880]   to point out that when Bezos talked about the Amazon Firephone he did not
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:53.080]   once mentioned making phone calls right we don't do that who who makes a phone
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:57.320]   call anymore it was it's well I mean do that it says phone in the name but it
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:01.360]   isn't really a big part of it right or it maybe it's just something you don't
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.720]   have to mention yeah well of course you can make phone calls not that you'd
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:06.960]   ever want to so let's get back to the surface the other thing I was a little
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:09.240]   worried about and I don't know if you know Robert but we were talking about
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:12.880]   this on Windows weekly both Paul and Mary Jo had the pre-release surface pro
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:17.720]   threes that were they got from Microsoft at the announcement and they've had
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:23.720]   weird power problems yeah you can it would lose power it would lose the time of
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:28.200]   day you'd have to reset the machine and there was some question about if
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:32.600]   Microsoft had was gonna fix this with a patch when the surface pro 3 came out
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:36.640]   if it would be forced when you download it did they fix it what is the status
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:40.320]   maybe something the chat room knows if you bought a surface pro 3 well I mean
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:43.240]   see I mean the machines that they got even though they say oh well these are
[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:47.160]   preview machines they were part of the of the manufacturing batch they didn't
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:51.040]   manufacture a thousand prototypes and hand them out to the press so those same
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:54.620]   machines are the ones that you're gonna buy in the store I wasn't able to
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:58.440]   duplicate the power problem because I didn't have it long enough right I have
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:02.720]   read about it and it's fairly serious I'm not convinced that it's a software
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:05.840]   problem I think it might actually be a hard right see they that was part of the
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:12.160]   question they believe that the software fix could fix it so we don't know but
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:14.240]   it's something you should probably ask for you
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:23.640]   that's a matter of some concern I need two things I need a production laptop and
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:28.880]   frankly an air would work very well for what I'm doing on that I need something
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.120]   I can write on when I'm away but I also need something I can sit at the breakfast
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:40.200]   table and use one note to go through the newspapers both online and the
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:45.880]   paper paper in my hands that's a perfect one that's what the surface is it's
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:51.320]   new it's made for one note because you press you you take out the the pen and
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.720]   you press the button and one that launches it is like a dead it would be a
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:58.240]   great dedicated one-on-shoot by the way a marigio foley did tweet that they
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:02.480]   there was a firmware update that when you open the surface pro 3 and turn it
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:07.720]   on immediately applied and they say does fix that power problem huh all right so
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:11.400]   apparently they have yeah apparently they have fixed it given that if they
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:14.600]   fix that problem then Jerry and given what you want to do I think the surface
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:19.680]   pro 3 is exactly what you want understand I'm going to get a laptop too
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:22.960]   and that aces are looked interesting love the aces are that's what Mary Joe
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:26.800]   boy yeah she did a lot of research she finally picked up one of these things
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:31.960]   that lays it less than three pounds gets about 10 hours of battery life crazy
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:36.360]   crazy fast and of course touchscreen if you can buy both Jerry that sounds like
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:43.000]   a great combination yeah well given what I do I need both a laptop and a tablet I
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:50.840]   I did manage to do a couple of conduct is with just that compact HP laptop and
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:55.000]   it worked pretty good and I could go in the press room and connect it to the
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.720]   internet with the with its bills to an ethernet and and follow stories from it
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:05.840]   but I found by and large that tablets few of them have a keyboard that I can
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:11.200]   write fast on yeah I think you'd feel the same way with this touch or type I
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:14.840]   guess you only do the type cover now although try this case your keyboard
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:20.120]   because like a lot of yeah like a lot of yeah but like a lot of modern keyboards
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:24.120]   it is a very short throw and you may find I actually have trouble typing with it
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:27.160]   and if that's the case then you should stick with your Lenovo and the carbon
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:30.920]   X1 all but you have the last version you have the first I know I don't have this
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:34.680]   new one is the new one is it a little bit better yeah still a short throw but it
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:40.400]   clicks a little bit alright yeah I'll give it a try I'm probably gonna just end
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:45.280]   up with another thinkpad I've had good experience with them they're excellent
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:49.640]   Jerry it is always such a pleasure to have you on every time we have you on I
