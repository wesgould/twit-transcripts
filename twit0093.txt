[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.200]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.600]   AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.600]   [ Music ]
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.320]   This is Twit, this weekend tech.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.040]   Episode 93 for April 2nd, 2007 GMT.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.560]   [ Music ]
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.760]   Hi, this is Leo LePore.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.360]   This edition of This Week in Tech was recorded before a live audience
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.160]   at the GMT Podcast Seminar in San Francisco at the ZM Auditorium.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.280]   We want to thank the Pixel Core, Alex Lindsey,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.880]   Scott Born and the ZM for their support in this podcast.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.720]   [ Music ]
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.880]   This is a panel that hasn't been with us in a long time and I'm really glad to welcome them.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.280]   Let me introduce from the left ladies and gentlemen from dl.tv my old pal Patrick Norton.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.200]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.240]   It's so polite.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.040]   I should explain.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.840]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.520]   It's not that there's a, you know, I'm in a very crowded closet.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.560]   We're actually in an auditorium.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.440]   We're at the ZM, beautiful ZM here in San Francisco where we have a live audience of about 100 people
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.840]   who have just attended three days of ear bleeding conference on a podcasting called GMT.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.440]   Two Patricks left, Mr. David Prager from revision3.com.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.080]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.400]   David's responsible for providing the Jaegermeister for each and every episode of "Dig Nation" and that.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.840]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.280]   There's no more booze this all beer.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.040]   Is it really you don't do booze anymore?
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.320]   Ever since this Reno thing.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.240]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.480]   The one where they just kept pushing shots at Alex.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.480]   If you make drinking a part of your show and then you do live shows then all the fans want to
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.680]   provide the drinks and so you know you have to accept everyone's drink and it's a bad situation.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.080]   See, they're learning something in this seminar already.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   No hard liquor.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.560]   Oh, you're a liquor.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.920]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.160]   That's Roger Chang also from dl.tv.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.600]   It's great to see you again Roger.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.560]   [ Applause ]
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.080]   Haven't been on the show in ages.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.400]   Yes, I've been really busy.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.440]   Well, you've been yeah, right?
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.640]   You've been that's Roger.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.440]   He has.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.120]   I just did dl.tv last night and which in that show will air later this week.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.000]   Next week.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.960]   Next, well this week.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.080]   Because this is airing Monday so it will be this week.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.960]   Right?
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.560]   Yeah, I know it's hard but.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.360]   It's like bar time.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.680]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.480]   Anyway, that was fun.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.600]   I showed off parallels on the on the show.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.000]   Also from dl.tv and HDTV expert at PC Magazine, Mr. Robert Harrod.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.640]   Hello. Hello.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.360]   You missed your HD expertise.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yes indeed.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.880]   Good to have you back.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.160]   Back for my surgery.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.120]   Yeah, how'd that go?
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.160]   Went well.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.760]   The recovery takes forever but.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.040]   David told me you had to face the ground for two weeks.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.920]   Oh, eight days.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.720]   Surgery was about 90 minutes followed by
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.400]   eight days straight of keeping my head face down.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.560]   This could be hard for somebody to review his HDTVs.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.280]   What did you do?
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.640]   Took a couple weeks off for this.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.960]   Oh, I was going to say you have a special chair.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.160]   Oh, it was a pain.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.640]   That's hard.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.000]   I mean, even as you're walking around,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.720]   you have to look at the ground.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.120]   Yeah, let me tell you.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.080]   You do that for a few hours and you get a back pain like you want the lead.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.560]   Like that.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.120]   Torturous.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.320]   Did you wear a helmet?
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.800]   Nah.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.520]   Nah.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.640]   Had a cool chin thing.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.400]   I was like, "That was a bad choice."
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.000]   And my chiropractor offered that.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.640]   Table with the hole in it so you could stick your face around your guide.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.920]   That was ridiculous.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.760]   You don't ever want to have it attached red.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.120]   Now that's all I could say, John.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.160]   You never want to have it.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.400]   Also here from Buzz Out Loud, she's the spy.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.440]   Everybody else is ZD.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.280]   She's from CNET.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.760]   Ms. Veronica Belmont.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.640]   Great to have you back.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.080]   I tell everybody, if you really want a good tech podcast,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.360]   you should listen to Buzz Out Loud.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.640]   Well, thank you.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.280]   It's true.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.600]   Love it.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.960]   You, Molly and Tom Merritt.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.840]   Tom's also a ZD, old CD alum, a former web producer for us at Tech TV.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.400]   And in the middle, the center seat, JohnC.devorect.org/ponavoffcenter.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.960]   But yeah.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.760]   Well, you know.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.480]   [applause]
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.880]   ZD, org.org/vlog.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.600]   There you go.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.560]   Got to plug it.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.600]   We didn't talk last week.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.840]   We really didn't do much news because we had the Tiki guys on.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.240]   So we just talked about booze most of the time.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.000]   But there are quite a few news stories,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.680]   even some from last week that we didn't get to.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.960]   For instance, Vonage loses its patents to Verizon.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.040]   Putting the whole company in jeopardy.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.280]   Verizon claims that they patented the voice over IP technology.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.320]   Vonage is using Vonage.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.880]   Said, wait a minute.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.240]   This is off the shelf technology.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.960]   What?
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.320]   And now they've got two weeks.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.080]   The judge will decide in a couple of weeks
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.280]   whether to enforce the restraining order immediately,
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.400]   which would, I think, would put Vonage out of business.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.760]   Can Vonage survive this?
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.480]   Roger, anybody here at Vonage User?
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.680]   I am.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.040]   I work with Vonage User.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.000]   I'm a--
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.040]   Depends on Scars-D-Vlog.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.440]   I was a user at the very beginning,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.640]   and then I gave up on the service.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.760]   I thought it was flaky.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.440]   That's the problem. It cannot replace home phone service, really.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.080]   You still need at least a cell or something,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.440]   because it doesn't work half the time.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.680]   Right.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.000]   And for 911, that's no good.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.120]   Is Vonage claiming they were the ones who invented digitizing sound
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.280]   and transmitting that in a full duplex mode?
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.480]   Oh, you mean is Verizon?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.680]   What is Verizon's patent?
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.280]   You mean it beats me.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.080]   They say that they have a patent on the voice over IP technology.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.640]   That seems like really old technology that was just repurposed to,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.600]   you know, provide--
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.240]   Well, I mean, what did you just--
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.200]   Did you talk to me?
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.280]   --to me, Verizon doesn't like Vonage.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.440]   And they want to do whatever they can to put it out of business, right?
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.080]   I hear that.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.480]   So how is this going to affect other VoIP services,
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   like Gizmo Project and Skype?
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.800]   And is it just things that go from internet to phone,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.080]   or is it internet to internet kind of VoIP style?
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.960]   It should be in the article.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.000]   Apparently nobody knows.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.320]   You know, the--
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.040]   I do know this, the Vonage CEO came on and said,
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.080]   "This says that.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.960]   Don't worry about it."
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah, but this is because they're--
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.240]   Because they're--
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.280]   Because the stop dropped.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.400]   The stop went back up.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.160]   Did it go all the way back up?
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.000]   Did you buy Vonage stock right now?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.240]   No, I wouldn't buy it 10 years ago.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.560]   Especially now, it seems like that's not a--
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.160]   It's not a good time to buy it.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.800]   Maybe actually they would be a good time to buy it really cheap.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.200]   I'm not a fan of the company that says I wouldn't buy the stock.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.320]   Are you a fan of VoIP?
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.520]   Do you think VoIP has the future?
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.080]   I think Skype's-- we use it all the time.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.960]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.440]   VoIP is taking over, by the way.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.760]   I mean, if you go-- even if you went to the Von
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.840]   showdown in Santa Clara, which had, you know,
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.480]   it was supposed to be video, voice, and all the stuff over
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.520]   networks, all it was was VoIP.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.640]   Everything, everybody--
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.080]   Well, that's on the lawn show is.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.880]   Yeah, I know.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.480]   But they were trying to get video in there,
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.360]   and they couldn't do it.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.000]   I mean, it was--
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.520]   Well, the video thing is the skunk works.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.200]   The guy that started VoIP--
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.520]   Paul Ver.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.200]   Yeah, Paul Ver basically is like, you know,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.960]   I basically own convention centers.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.400]   I think video on the web is the next thing.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.880]   So he basically takes two rooms out of the convention center
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.080]   and dedicates that to video.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.920]   Hey, you got to give Paul Ver credit, though.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.400]   He's been talking about voice over the net for longer than anybody.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.800]   I mean--
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.440]   No argument.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.640]   That's his job.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.000]   But I mean, he started it.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.040]   I mean, that's--
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.320]   Well, it's his specialty.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.200]   He's the guy.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.120]   In fact, you can call him up.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.960]   And if you have a screwball question,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.560]   he's--
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.560]   He's--
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   Love the talk.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.120]   I don't know.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.960]   And you'll talk like that, right?
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.640]   Well, yeah, but there's also VoIP.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.840]   A lot of what is in Von is, you know,
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.200]   everybody here use a phone from, say, you know, a landline.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.560]   You know, you're already using VoIP,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.680]   which is a different area.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.040]   Your lawn distance is probably--
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.320]   is almost invariably--
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.440]   Oprocees is--
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.920]   Yeah, and VoIP has to be separated from voice
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.160]   over the internet.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.120]   You know, voice over--
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.960]   I mean, if you're using calling cards
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.440]   for like a long distance, for example, which are very handy,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.400]   there's all VoIP, but they're all private networks.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.920]   Right.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.480]   And the-- but it's just routed using IP.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.840]   To answer Veronica's question, I think Skype probably
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.280]   doesn't use the same technology.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   It depends on-- you're right.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.680]   How broadly written is this Verizon patent?
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.000]   I mean, if it's digitizing voice over the network,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.440]   that could be a problem.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.560]   But I have a feeling that this--
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.440]   I mean, they haven't made any noise about going after
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.280]   anybody else.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.640]   They want to go after the guys who
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.080]   are going after their business model.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.760]   All right, next.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.120]   OK, I'm going to pick something a little juicier.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.720]   The triple X domain--
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   --falls one more time.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.720]   Yeah, bad, bad.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720]   You think that's bad?
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.120]   Well, I'm the big promoter of the--
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.320]   I think I may have been the first guy to write about this.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.960]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.160]   The porno guys say we will never do it.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.920]   We hate the idea because it's a ghetto and we want to be.com.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.440]   They should be a ghetto.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:23.960]   I agree.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.360]   I mean, it's like when you go to a small town,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   you run into these little--
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:26.880]   The red light--
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.360]   These booths.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.800]   You know, the video booths--
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   The girls, girls, girls, girls, and it's always in a special
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   zoning.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   You don't put it next to a church.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   I'm like, you know.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   And the way it is now the XXX stuff, even though there's no
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   dot XXX is next to the church.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   And the weird thing is that some of these church people have
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   been--
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   They're against it, too.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   I know.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   I don't get it.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   I think it's because they want to be next to the XXX place.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   I can't figure it out.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   I can figure it out.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   It doesn't make any--
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   I think that what happened here is I can.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   I can lost their nerve.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   They're afraid that they're going to have to somehow be
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   responsible for policing it.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   That's what the Canadian government said.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   They say, if you guys do this, you're going to decide what's
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   porn and you're going to decide who becomes an XXX domain name.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   And I think I can't, says, we don't want to do that.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   I wouldn't want to be in that position.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   They're somehow transferring the dot com owners right now to
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   dot triple X.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   Who's going to police that?
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   That's the real thing.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   And what's to keep them from simply taking both domains?
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   Well, the sticky part is really what they consider to be a
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   dot XXX.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   Oh, that was poor taste, Roger.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   Roger, I am our shame.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   This is more about hyper-life.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   It's a slippery slope, that's that.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   Yes, it is very slippery.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   That's even worse.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   It's the camel's nose.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   Well, because a lot of stuff that could be considered, you know,
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   inappropriate for some people is just, you know, for example,
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   sexual education material and health issues.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   Well, let's use one that's a little bit--
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   Obviously, that's a real problem.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   But what about Playboy?
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   Playboy's got Playboy.com.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   Are they going to say we're triple X?
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   No way.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   No.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   Are they going to give up their dot com?
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   Playboy is triple X.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   Yeah, but we've got an email on D.L.TV.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   It's like, you know, you shouldn't make a Playboy joke.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   It's hurting America.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   It's like--
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   Playboy's hurting--
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   You know, if it's painful, you should probably stop.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   I'm sorry I lost my hand.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.800]   All right.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   Next topic.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   That was the first real one.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   Important anniversary today, actually yesterday.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.800]   Melissa, in 1999, the very first email virus that spread so fast
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   that Symantec and all the other companies went, "What?"
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   We've got a new business model.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   Whoa!
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   Remember around-the-clock coverage?
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   Melissa, did we do it around the--
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   'Cause we were one-year-old on Tech TV.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   Yes, and I remember--
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   That would be Harry Fuller.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.660]   Harry Fuller. No, no anything broke. Harry Fuller would make you do round the clock.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.660]   That was the first time we saw Leo in the shirt in the suspenders and you're you're sort of...
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.320]   Oh, so you're doing a...
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.240]   Good or bad. Joining us now, a panel to discuss. I don't remember.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:59.660]   I remember the suspenders. They made him. They've moved it. They've taken his, they talked, you know, I don't know what happened.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.640]   That was "TechLive." That was later. I don't know how. Yeah. Okay.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.160]   The more the suspenders to distinguish me. The whole thing on on on ZD TV was I did two TV
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.360]   shows, right? I thought it was he. So the confused people, I thought, well the only
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.000]   thing I could do is wear a different wardrobe on each show and they'll know, oh this must be
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.600]   Call for Help because he's wearing a sweater. Oh this must be the screen.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.120]   Mr. Rogers look on Call for Help. Yeah. And the screen's a very Hawaiian shirt.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.560]   Right. So when I started doing news I thought, hmm, suspenders? So that way you knew who
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.160]   wish Leo you were watching. Well and your hair was perfect. The hair was always...
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.560]   Dynamite. So what did we do in the wall of wall coverage? What do you say?
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.800]   Well no, you were, I remember, I remember Becky did something about like what do you do
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.880]   when your box gets infected and how you clear it out and then we covered on each of the
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.040]   shows, Call for Help, ScreenSavers and News. When you're a tech network you hope that something
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.280]   like this will happen. I mean this is a successful social engineer in terms of how people acquire
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.840]   the Melissa virus. Well the Melissa virus didn't have to click something in November. Yeah, no, it was a word doc.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.800]   It was a word doc or something like that. Right, with some.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.400]   And then if you open the document and... And it was spoofed right? I think it was spoofed.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.800]   I don't know. So it would come from me. Yeah. It would come from you. It would use outlook I think.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   It would do some sort of an outlook. It would do some sort of an outlook. It would do some sort of an outlook.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   Like 50 or so contacts and then those people would, anyone else who opens it would do the same thing through their outlook.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.560]   And then as far as like malicious damage I don't even think it did anything.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.800]   Veronica did you have a problem in your priest? Nobody has happened?
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   Geez thanks.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   It was the first big virus that really spread using the internet.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   One of the last.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   Well let's see it was 1999. It was seven years ago. What were you doing seven years ago?
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   I was a junior in high school. All right, I rest my case.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   Were you helping people solve their Melissa problems?
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   How are you arresting your case on that you said preschool?
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   I just exaggerated for a make a point. When did I love you come out?
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   It came out there. That was much bigger.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   Melissa was the first one. Melissa was written. Melissa was more creative too. I liked it.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   Melissa was written by a guy, I think in the Midwest he dedicated it to a stripper named Melissa in Florida.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   That's where the name came from.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   Thank you Florida.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   Thank you, strip.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   Stripper in Florida.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   But I repeat myself.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   The guy was sentenced to 20 years, did 20 months and he's out in the bad. He probably is a very good job at security.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   I bet he's working for Symantec.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   Probably.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   Probably right. That's what happens to these guys. Kevin Mitnick called me today and you never want to take a call from Kevin Mitnick.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   So he always spoofs the caller ID.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   But see he doesn't realize if I get a call from the White House, I know it's Kevin Mitnick.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   I'm not stupid.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   So did we learn anything from Melissa? I mean we learned not to open attachments.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   You know it's not a problem anymore is it?
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   Why do you think that is?
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   It's not because the antivirus companies can act so fast because they still have that 20 point.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   No it's because all the smart money that used to do these viruses are now doing spyware.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   Or phishing attacks.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   Or phishing attacks or something more creative money making.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   I think there's another reason I think that people have learned not to open it.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   I don't agree with that at all.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   No.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   I agree with her.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.800]   You think people are too stupid?
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   Totally.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   Completely.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   Social engineering because there is no patch for human stupidity.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   You know what changed or the little messages that come with it?
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   Before it used to be pretty boneheaded simple it's all well it's obviously you know not attachment for you.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   But now that they put oh pick up your prize or oh I forgot to email you this.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.800]   It's just like oh click.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   Well now there's another aspect to this which was the scarier part in effect I wrote a poem about this maybe two or three years ago about people.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   It turns out people with OCD obsessive compulsive disorder they will actually when presented with a click here.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   They'll do it.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   They can't not do it.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   Oh interesting.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.800]   And essentially they have to click you know they just have to click.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   I'm wondering so the entire spam community is basically predicated all the two percent of the.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   Hey it's all the whole population that's OCD.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   Time to punch the monkey.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   Time to punch the monkey.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   Time to punch the monkey.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   I think it's possible too that people are lulled into a false sense of security by these security agencies that they think that they may be on top of it and so they feel more secure than they actually are.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   But that's what I'm saying is that we don't see these.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   This might be okay.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   But we don't see these email viruses anymore.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   You're not you're also seeing more Trojans too that simply are trying to take over the box in such a subtle way where you might not even recognize it.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   That's the point is that.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   And then you have command of that box.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   We may be seeing as many army of zombie boxes to keep.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   We just don't know.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   It's been served.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   It's the new mommy.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   So in fact there may be just as many email viruses as before but because they don't announce themselves people are getting them and they don't even know.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   Well supposedly 25% of all computers are infected.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   But I think that number is low and I think we've talked about this before.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   Hey speaking of columns.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.800]   I got to tell you.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   John C. de Vorek says Apple should just kill the iPhone before it's too late.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   You happy now?
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   Why should Apple kill the iPhone before it's too late?
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   Well I know I'm just going to say.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   Wait, wait.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   First of all I want to like everybody in the audience like you know you're an apple apologist when you're booing someone who says that perhaps a product might suck that hasn't been released yet.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   No he's not saying that the product might suck.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.800]   You're saying this is a business apple doesn't want to be in.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   Right.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   Well that's why I said in that column you're talking about a market watch column written last week.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.800]   I have said that the likelihood of it sucking is quite high too.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   Although I didn't write about that.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   And largely because you only make so many points and 650 words but I got a lot of it.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   I got two kinds of email.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   I got the typical psycho email from somebody who doesn't need to be like Patrick says.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   The product site unseen must be great.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   But I got a note from a guy in singular who's testing the product and he says that you have one here on the phone.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   No no.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   Yeah here's the iPhone I just wanted to think.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   Do you like it sir?
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   Anyway the singular guy's testing it and he says there's lots of issues.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   He says the...
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   Well it's early.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   It's not going to be early.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   It's not going to be early.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   It's just the amateur mistake that they made is having non... not having a removable battery.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   He says it's also running 20 minutes and you're using up half the battery power.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   You've got 40 minutes total talk time.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   That's not good.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   And he says the interface follows up about constantly.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   Who's this guy?
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   The guy at singular that's testing the product.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.800]   You think singular wouldn't want to put this information out there during the trial to sell this in a couple of months.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   He's telling me confidentially and I shouldn't be telling anybody.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   This is also...
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   This is non-final product.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   The whole idea of being...
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   No no no because you know he changed the battery.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   Actually the hold on.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.800]   I've been testing beta products for a decade.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   Performance often goes up dramatically.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   The battery like coding does huge things.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   Let's assume that's true.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   But then again let's go back to the point I was really making in the market watchcom which is that this is a hard business to be in.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   Apple's never really competed well where they actually have competition and my argument is that they've done so well with the iPod because the bone heads that they're competing with won't even take out an advertisement.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   So you say this is hubris on Apple's part to sell it.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   Oh they because they kick the ass of a bunch of bone heads they think they can do no wrong which is not going to be the case.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   You know I said this for a long time with that sugar nut.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   I didn't believe they were going to do a phone for this exact reason.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   I thought you guys don't want to get this.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   And Nokia already had a death battle.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   They're throwing money at it like there's no tomorrow.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   They're putting it in Samsung too.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   Samsung too.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   No but those are not even the big player.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   I mean Nokia and Motorola number one.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   What about Sony Ericsson?
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   They're four.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   They're not even going to be in the game shortly.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   They were dominant for a while.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   Anyway so that's what my concern was and I think Apple should sucker Samsung or somebody else to take the product as a reference design and then take all the credit for it if it's successful and then take none of the blame if it fails.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   And that's what my column is about not about bashing Apple.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:53.800]   I think Apple suckers everyone into doing everything to the way that they wanted them to do it.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   I mean they suckered the music industry and letting them sell the music.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.800]   They suck.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   I mean what they've done with the iPhone as far as I can tell is they've decided that they're going to throw everything out the door and redesign from the bottom up.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   And that's one of the main things that I kind of actually think is kind of neat in the fact that they've been able to like completely take a blank saying this is what we want and not take anyone's influence.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   Of course that they took singular all the way to saying we want you to jump in the court with us with this thing and we're not even going to let you see it until two weeks before we announce it.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   And if you sign up for a singular contract on this new iPhone we Apple get a cut.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   No one else has that deal.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   I mean it's insane the amount of bullying that Apple can do and like yes it's a juggernaut of an industry but I mean my God what they've done.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   If this were the I've everyone wants one.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   If this were the iPod of the cell phone industry singular made a brilliant move.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   Right?
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   That was a good deal for singular.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   If it becomes that they still had you know how many hundreds of articles have been written about this and suddenly singular seems like this.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.800]   We have the coolest phones on the planet and look at all this neat stuff we're doing and by the way we're coming AT&T.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   That cuts both ways of the products of Flop.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   Veronica you were at CTIA was there any talk of the iPhone there?
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   Well apparently it was pulled out of a pocket at an AT&T event for a little bit but it is interesting the way that it is encouraging cell phone manufacturers to look at things differently and to do different things.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   For example with the Samsung upstage they have the 99 cent over the air downloads and that's a big deal.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   That's like competing with iTunes directly and then you know the LG Prada phone too which looks very similar to the iPhone.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   It's like they stole the design.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   Yeah I mean I saw that one too and it looks really great and the touchscreen works well.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   Oh so there's good functionality the touchscreen works.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   Yeah I didn't try it with text messaging but for making phone calls and going through the menu of course the interface on the iPhone is going to be very different.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   CTIA is the big cell phone conference once a year.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   Was this the big buzz at CTIA is the iPhone?
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   You know not as many people were talking about it as I expected.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   It was very slow news at CTIA.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   Maybe they're all just waiting.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   We know it's quite possible.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   We believe we know now that June 11th will be the ship date.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   That's what singular is saying.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   Yeah and that coincidentally entirely coincides with the first day of WWDC the Apple Developer Conference.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   You know I was trying to attempt you Scott Born.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   I put a microphone out there and everything Scott Born is the iPhone bigot.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   This guy he owns the site is Apple Phone.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   Show.com.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   All he could talk about on Mac Break Weekly for the last 28 episodes was the iPhone.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   Do you have response to Mr. Devora?
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   I do.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   Well when I first said you have an iPhone?
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   Of course I don't.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   Oh.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   Have you had an iPhone?
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   No I don't but I don't think it's going to be great if I haven't even played with it.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   I have four simple points the last of which is the clearly most obvious.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   Number one.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   Mr. Norton who is somewhat of a curmudgeon in training.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   It has pointed out to the senior curmudgeon that the product is not even shipping yet so
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   maybe we won't burn the barn down just yet.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   Number two.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   One.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   Million people have put their email address in the hands of singular saying please notify me
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.800]   when this phone's coming.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   That breaks probably every record ever established.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   Number three.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   At Macworld people lined up for hours to stare at a piece of plastic in casey.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   They did that for the shuffle.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   They did it.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   The real audience.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   But here's the big point.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   Right next door with the most beautiful booth babe at the show and she was lonely.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   That tells you a lot about the Apple customer right there.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:36.120]   But here is simply the most easily made point of all to rebut this whole notion.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.920]   What does he say every chance he opens his mouth?
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.800]   What words come out of Mr. Dvorak?
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.880]   Dvorak.org/blog.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:49.360]   What this is is another clever trick by Mr. Dvorak to get one million hits and that's
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   all it's about.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   All right.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.360]   Thank you Scott Warren.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.040]   Well thanks for letting me get a plug in.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.760]   First in case you think Apple can do no wrong.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.040]   New launches.com has published this list of the 10 Apple products which flopped including
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.040]   some of my favorites.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   Apple's Cyberdog.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   You remember that?
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   No.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   Internet Suite developed to work on Mac OS.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.440]   It was an open dock based.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   Yep.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.440]   Taligent.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.440]   This was the union.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.440]   Don't say that.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.560]   That was just a scam from the get go.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.520]   That was in that Gil Amelia's deal with IBM to do an operating system.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.760]   Was it Amelia or was it the something else?
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   Somebody been spindler or even the skull.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   Maybe a spindler.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.760]   Maybe a spindler.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   Was that pink?
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.320]   So a pink came out of that era.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.200]   I don't think it's how it's pink though.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   Apple E World.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.760]   Remember their AOL competitor?
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   Yep.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.160]   This is by the way E World is the most interesting one in this crowd because this is the moment
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:50.640]   that Apple was handed on a silver platter the entire internet because the only browser
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.320]   available at the time was running only on the Apple.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.120]   That was the mosaic browser that first came out of Illinois and they were essentially
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.640]   given the opportunity to rock with this.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.240]   They would have owned the internet but they decided to do this because AOL was doing so
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.240]   well.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:10.800]   In fact there was a number of initiatives right as the internet was coming online besides
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.840]   E World that showed up that were supposed to take over.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.880]   I mean the MSN was supposed to kill the internet according to one of the content.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.880]   E World was actually great.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.880]   I had an E World account.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.880]   I liked it.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.880]   I mean you had a little town interface.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.880]   It was a little goofy but it was fun.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.880]   But here's the thing that's interesting.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.720]   It came on every Macintosh shipped but instead of putting it as Microsoft would have on the
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:34.440]   desktop they buried it two folders down on the Mac and nobody ever could find it.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   Apple's Pippin.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.400]   Oh I remember that.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   The gaming machine.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.760]   It was a co-production between them and Bandai.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.880]   It was supposed to be their kind of set top gaming box but it had this a 14-4 modem.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.880]   It was rockin.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   It was pretty underpowered.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.480]   I don't think they never released it.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.080]   You can make the case that 42,000 of this ill-vated device were sold for silent data.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.120]   Somebody out there got you a selectable.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.280]   Someone built a house out of it or something.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.360]   But you can make the case that in many of these cases Apple was just ahead of its time
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.680]   that these were products that are now successful.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.880]   Yes because you know Trip Hawkins followed the 3DO and that was a flop.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.880]   I had a 3DO.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.480]   Actually going back to the sort of iPhone argument the Pippin was not ahead of its time.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.840]   The Pippin was brought out late to compete with three heavily entrenched and considerably
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.680]   better funded and thought out of it.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   PlayStation, Nintendo, 64.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.880]   Well no the key thing about the Pippin was is also supposed to do things beyond gaming.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.880]   It was a set top box.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.880]   It really wasn't the gaming.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   It was supposed to do the info entertaining.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.280]   PlayStation out before after the Pippin.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.280]   I don't know.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   That's a good question.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   So it was Nintendo that they were competing against.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   Nintendo's Sega.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   And Atari.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.280]   Oh it's Sega.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   And television.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   No.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   ColecoVision.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   Did you have a Coleco?
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.280]   No, no.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.280]   Tell her what your...
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   Rogers.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.080]   My mom was a vice president of Coleco.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.080]   Really?
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   My dad worked for Hasbro.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.080]   Oh lucky.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   You're kidding.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.080]   Toy Dynasty.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   Did they meet when the two merged or...?
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   No.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   No.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   No.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   They never merged.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.480]   Coleco made their money back making the cabbage patch dull.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   Really?
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.480]   Yes.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   It's bad.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   Yep.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   Was your mom responsible for the cabbage patch?
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   She worked with them and she also worked with the...
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.480]   They were real people before they were made in the doll.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.480]   Yeah she was very into...
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   Very petty.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.480]   The atom.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   Did you have an atom when you were in high school, junior in high school?
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   I know.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   She was in free school.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.880]   That was a little before my computer time.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.680]   Number six, the 20th anniversary Macintosh.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.280]   That was supposed to be the future of computing.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.080]   Was it going to have leather on it?
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   Was it leather?
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   It still looks pretty futuristic.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   It was cool looking.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.080]   It was a great looking computer.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.080]   It was just like...
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   It was at the bottom of Apple sales.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.880]   The Apple market was a nightmare.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.880]   It was too expensive.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   It was $7,500.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.280]   Didn't have a CD-ROM drive which was a pretty big deal in those days and Bose speakers.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.360]   A subwoofer which doubled as a power supply.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.360]   That's smart.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.360]   Wow.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.120]   Well you know that's a lot like the atom because the atom used to have its power supply for
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.840]   the entire system and the printer.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840]   In the printer?
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.840]   Yes.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.840]   So that went your out of computers.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.840]   He's a king of weird trivia.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.840]   He's got the trivia today.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.840]   He's got the trivia today.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.440]   Closer to modern times and really supporting your contention, the Motorola Rocker which was
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.760]   Motorola's iTunes phone which was only a couple of years old, nobody bought.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.560]   No, there were three or four.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   Three or four?
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.560]   Yeah sold a couple.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.560]   Macintosh TV.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.080]   I think it was very well marketed.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   That was actually...
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.120]   I don't know if that wasn't even a product.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.080]   It was a screw variation.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.080]   They were selling the dorm.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.920]   Somebody pointed out though when Apple TV came out that this was really just Macintosh
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   TV.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.960]   It was very similar to the Macintosh TV in concert anyway.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.160]   It sucks a lot less.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.160]   You like the Apple TV.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   Oh yeah, the Apple TV is fine.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.000]   The Macintosh TV was fine but it was again...
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.680]   It was when they had 42 skews for us.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.680]   Right.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   So they had three different...
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.680]   It was crazy for a while.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.920]   And they had one for education, one for consumers, one for businesses and they was just...
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.120]   And they killed themselves.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   And Mac portable?
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.120]   Yeah, well that seems...
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   I have one of these.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   And Mac portable?
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.120]   Yeah, it's totally...
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.120]   Oh, that'd be...
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.120]   Oh, that'd be...
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.120]   ...and totally collected.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   ...black and white though, right?
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   68,000 processor, 16 megahertz, a massive one megabyte of RAM.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   Still boots.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.120]   Does it?
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   So isn't that just a portable Mac SE?
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.520]   Yeah, it's just a basically a big giant clunker.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.520]   This was the giant...
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.520]   16 pounds?
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520]   It was huge, yeah.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   It was a monster.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.520]   That's like...
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520]   15.8 pounds.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.520]   Wow, it was affordable, not a laptop.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   Yeah, compared to a compact portable too, that thing's pretty...
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.000]   You know, they put the lease on this list.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   I'm not sure I agree.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   I mean, it didn't sell it a lot but it sure...
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.800]   But the lease had led the way for what became the Mac and Dutch.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   Right.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.880]   Well, you know, I would say that the thing about the lease of which...
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   And that...
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.880]   Which is not on the list.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.200]   One of the really big flops was the twiggy drive.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.440]   That was the flaw on the lease.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.720]   Well, you put your thumb right on the media as you put the thing in.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.960]   The hole, the cutout on the floppy was right where you put your thumb.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.960]   That not a good design.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.520]   That wasn't the flaw of the Lisa.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.360]   The flaw of the Lisa was $10,000 price point.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.360]   I know.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.360]   I drooled on it but I didn't buy one.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.960]   That's what I mean when an IBM AT was costing like what, four grand with no software and
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   no storage.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.960]   Yeah, but ten was still...
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   I mean...
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.960]   I mean...
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.960]   I was a price point issue.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   Ten was pretty high.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   I'm not saying it's not a ridiculous...
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   I was a junior in high school when that came out.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.960]   Really?
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   I wasn't great school.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   I learned to prove to him about the auction site on eBay.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   Yeah, right.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   I was this many.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   You were too?
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   Preschool.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.960]   One.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.960]   One.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.960]   Oh God.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.960]   And of course the number one has to be Newton.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   The Newton.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.960]   What else?
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:30.440]   You know what's interesting is that in many ways the iPhones a lot of what they wanted
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.520]   the Newton to be.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.440]   What about that crappy laptop that looked like a cosmetics case?
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.440]   You were the guy who got out of this.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.440]   You got out of this.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.440]   You got out of this.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.440]   And then he said it was like a girly laptop.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.440]   Yeah, because my daughter thought it was like a...
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.840]   I thought it should have a Mattel logo on it.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.320]   If I was doing the blog today I would have...
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   It did.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   It was a barbie-like laptop.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.320]   You're letting the air out of something.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.760]   This is a very Mac heavy product.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   Oh, crap.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.760]   It is.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.760]   I mean you can tell by looking at him.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.760]   Oh.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.640]   A million hits on his website.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   So, but if you go down this list it proves a couple of these first of all.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.640]   First of all...
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.000]   By the way, I want to make that clear.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.600]   That Apple has had some failures.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.320]   Although, a few of these were under Steve Jobs' watch.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.320]   No, they were...
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.320]   One thing mostly...
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   A few.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.320]   A few.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   Mostly Scully.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.320]   I mean the Lisa was Steve Jobs.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   The Newton was Scully.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320]   Well, this little mouse thing.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   Well, you know what's interesting?
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.320]   They actually didn't list the whole...
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   Oh, that Puck Mouse.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   Where would they...
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.800]   Every mouse Apple's ever made is worthless, if you ask me.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.040]   They've never made a good mouse.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.240]   Even the Mighty Mouse.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   Wow.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.400]   I remember when you first got that you were like, fawning over it.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.400]   Yeah, no.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.400]   If any actually used it.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.400]   I have to sit.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.400]   I have to sit.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   So, the carpal tunnel set in.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.920]   I feel the same way about the Mighty Mouse.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   It's a shame.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   I really wanted to like it.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   It works terribly.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.760]   It's because their dogma said, "Well, we really want a one button mouse."
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.080]   They demand a two button mouse.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.920]   Okay, we'll give them one, but it'll only have one button.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   We'll show them that.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.920]   We'll give them one button.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.920]   It won't have any buttons.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.880]   So, how the love handles on the side you get the space.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.200]   If you want a left click, you have to lift up your right finger.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.160]   First, because it knows that your fingers are on it.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.160]   I mean, that's the flaw.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   It's too smart.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   Right.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.320]   In a nutshell, is that the seven having two buttons, it notices where your fingers.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   So simple.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.320]   No one can use it.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.520]   No, but the other problem is you can't, if you want to lift the mouse to like put the
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.120]   cursor up somewhere else while you're clicking down, you want to drag something, you can't
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.400]   do that because once you lift the mouse up to go up to the corner, then it releases
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.400]   the, what you're dragging.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.400]   Yeah, it's nutty.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.120]   I like the little ball, little track ball in there.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.600]   That works because you can scroll in any arbitrary direction, but that's about it.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.040]   Anyway, that should be on here too.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.200]   Because every mouse should have a mouse built into it.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.680]   Mouse with a little track ball.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.760]   Intel announced, or gave us a little peek at the roadmap.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.680]   First of all, Penren is the next Intel chip.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.800]   Yes, it's the current core to all four.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.600]   But at a 45 nanometer.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.920]   And a minute with some improvements in power.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.640]   Well, a significant improvement because they can get up to 12 megabytes of L2 cache in
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640]   that sucker.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.640]   Wow.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.640]   I mean, that's going to make a difference in performance, right?
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.640]   Definitely.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.080]   If they actually put it in there.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.880]   They have the room, but they may not build it in.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   Is that the--
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   They might go into server applications.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.720]   Yeah, I mean, it's like the room.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   Is it Nahalom?
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   Nahalom?
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   Nahalom.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   Nahalom.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.400]   I mean, it's interesting because they're looking, it seems like they're trying to push the entire
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.960]   product line into a single design.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.960]   That's interesting.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   And they're very number of processors.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.280]   Basically, the very number of, very number of processors on the die.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.640]   So, so Penren is the second half of this year.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.440]   That's the one with, that's a smaller process.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.800]   It's 45 nanometers, which means you can get more silicon on it, which means you can have
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   a lot more cache.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   Port for DR3.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   Oh, really?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   For the data.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   So, faster memory.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   And that if you're using a single threaded application with that processor, it will be
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.160]   smart enough to go, oh, it's not utilizing both cores.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.560]   So, you know what, our thermal envelope is such that we can go ahead and overclock one
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.560]   of the cores.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.560]   Wow.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   And to get increased performance.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   More performance out of the one.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560]   It's just the other one.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.560]   It's the other one where.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.560]   What its capabilities are and what its thermal envelope is.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.560]   That's Penren?
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   Wow.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.280]   And if it's slacking off on one core, it's like, oh, crank up the other one.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.280]   Go to town.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.720]   Next year in Newhalem, and that has built in a built in memory controller.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   Yes.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.720]   Like AMD.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.640]   I mean, they've got so much room on these chips now.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.120]   And they're stepping away to silicon.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.880]   So you're saying, Patrick, that you believe their goal is to make one product with anything
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.760]   from one to eight cores in it.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.080]   That's what it, I mean, that's what it seems like.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.720]   It almost seems like they're going to sort of a single die with all these different options.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.960]   And then what they say, you know, they sell you, how much you got Roger?
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.400]   Okay, we'll enable two of them.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.480]   Well, if you think about it, it'd be a great way to scale across a product line.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.800]   If you have a single core model, you can make an ultra-mobile PC.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.840]   Same sockets, same bus.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.080]   Think about the money you say.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.840]   Does anybody really believe that this is even possibly going to happen with these guys?
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.080]   What, an eight core processor?
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.240]   No, I'm talking about one product that they're going to be able to prototype.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.880]   I'm not saying one product.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.760]   I'm saying like one design rather than having, you know, what do you call it?
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   Like the crappy product, the main-stream product.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.760]   Yeah, no, I understand it.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.160]   But the problem is they've got two or three design centers and they all compete with each
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.160]   other.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.200]   There's a lot of office politics in a big company like Intel.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.840]   The likelihood of this ever happening to me.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.840]   We want our own business.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.840]   Yeah, but think about it.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.480]   I mean, if you want to talk about the politics of Intel, it's like the Israeli design group
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   with the Penny M.M. came in and destroyed everybody in the United States.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.880]   And I think that's completely real of the entire architecture for the processor lines.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.600]   And then that got adopted into the, I mean, Intel at this point, Intel's got a guy running
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.000]   it that's really pissed off because he got his ass kicked by AMD.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.400]   He took a beating in Wall Street.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.400]   And now it's a total pride game for Intel.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.240]   It's like we're one of the most powerful companies in the industry.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.080]   We have all this money with all these research centers and it's producer die even more so
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.400]   than it was back in the battle days.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.880]   I'm not saying that they're not going to produce interesting stuff.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.240]   I'm just doubting that scenario is going to ever come.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.040]   Can you believe 45 nanometers?
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   That's amazing.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   I mean, that's why.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.080]   Does anybody concerned about the fact that they're dropping a $2.5 billion fab in the middle
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.800]   of China?
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   Well, where else?
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.280]   China's buying all of our, you know, China's buying all of our--
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.240]   Just a few years ago, our government was busting Toshi, but for selling something to like
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.440]   a Russian submarine company.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:07.360]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they were selling milling technology for the submarines.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.000]   Don't ever cross him on a military stuff because he--
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.280]   That happened like in the early 90s.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.520]   That really-- because it was--
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.380]   China owns us anyway.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.380]   We owe them how much?
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.380]   Okay, you're right.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.380]   We should just give in.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.520]   But it would be nice to see in the press release that, oh yes, this facility we are putting
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.280]   in China would include the latest in environmentally friendly processes and--
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.840]   Oh, that's why you put it in China.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   Yeah, I think we can--
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840]   Because we can--
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   We're not working there.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.840]   We're running.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.280]   These are not going to ever do our day workers working in an Intel fab.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.680]   Did you watch the host, the Korean movie, the formaldehyde giant fish mutated creature
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.920]   comes out and wags everyone?
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.600]   Is that true or-- is it fiction?
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:48.280]   It's fiction, but it's based on the fact that back in the early 90s, US medical doctors
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.200]   working in the mortuary, I guess it's a mortuary.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   Where they put dead people?
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.000]   Yes, he took 200-- basically 200 bottles worth of formaldehyde dumped it straight into the
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   drain.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And it's down in the Han River.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Yeah, that's actually supposed to be a great movie, yeah.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   You know what's great?
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.240]   If you like monster movies, I highly recommend it.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.040]   So it's fiction, but it's based on a true story.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   Yes, how we got from the Intel politics to that.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   I'm just saying we missed the last three ways.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.840]   It's okay for you to plug your website.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.840]   The show has it in the same since you last--
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.840]   What website?
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.840]   Or your blog.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.840]   One last thing on the pen range, they've actually enabled that hyper-threading style
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.400]   of technology in each core.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.400]   Yes.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   You can do--
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   So really, 16 processors.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   In a sense.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.400]   On an eight-way.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.280]   Well, at least a couple of virtual processors per core.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.760]   Well, the really cool thing is certain models will have an integrated graphics core as well.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.480]   So essentially, you could have a single solution on a very small board.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.440]   I'm more pleased that software designers and writers right now are catching up with
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.280]   multi-core, multi-processor technology--
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.280]   They're fighting the ratings.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.760]   Yeah, we're seeing a few actually consumer applications.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.520]   Like games in particular.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.520]   So games are starting to be--
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.600]   Supreme Commander is probably the best example out there right now.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.480]   It just came out a couple of weeks ago, and it is completely optimized for two, four cores
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.880]   and automatically detects and rolls.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:00.000]   Did the car max say that multi-threading and games don't go together?
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   The time he said it that was a valid argument.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.920]   It's like, well, there was that chicken in the egg argument.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.880]   There aren't enough dual-core processors in the market.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   But now everybody has dual-core.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.080]   And he was more or less pushing for a while there, at least the easiest way for new developers
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.880]   to get started was to look at the cell phone market and develop Java-based platform there
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.800]   and get your start there and then move into the more expensive hardware that's more difficult
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   to design for.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.760]   But it's a significant cost nowadays to do a production of a AAA time.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.280]   So you think all game-- were you at GDC, the game developer conference?
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.280]   I wasn't able to go this year.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   I wasn't able to go this year.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   Were you there?
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   I was laying flat down, running my eyeball.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.720]   A lot of multi-core talk?
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.360]   I didn't actually sit in on any panels.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   Oh, OK.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   Or anything.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.600]   All I could say is Alia Yacht-Est.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   That's our guild.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.600]   Exactly not.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.600]   No, that's our guild.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.600]   That's our guild.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.600]   Oh, you're a guild.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.600]   Oh, are you an Aliakt?
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.600]   Yes.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.000]   See me, possibly, and give me stuff.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   OK.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.120]   But you can also say that console systems, the latest console systems, are also promoting
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.960]   multi-core technology or multi-core thinking.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.520]   Well, that's what PS3 is, right?
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.240]   In a way, processor.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.240]   But I don't know.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.600]   Or at least-- it's interesting because it's like one of the things I saw at GDC was a heavy
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.800]   promotion for a lot of middleware and solutions like X and A, where you essentially kind of
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:18.000]   separate a bulk of the complexity away from the developers so they can concentrate on making
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   it.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.320]   It's a very valuable game that doesn't care about the hardware.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:26.480]   I mean, you still have to design for the hardware in mind, but it's not so much of writing
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.640]   straight to the metal.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.720]   But that's always been part of the point of GDCs for people to sell products to developers.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.720]   Oh, exactly.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.720]   That's what it is.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.720]   That's all it is.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.360]   I mean, they have massive management and porting to different platforms.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.720]   Intel says they're going to a 32 nanometer process in 2009.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.440]   Can't wait to see that.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.440]   Wow.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   Can you see?
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.440]   Can you get much smaller?
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.920]   When do we run up against 1 nanometers?
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   Negative nanometers?
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.400]   Yeah, we'll keep you game and see the thing.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.400]   They're already working on the light-based process or something.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.360]   They have to at some point because you're going to have quantum effects and you just
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.360]   just knock on work anymore.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.360]   They're effectively going to-- I think it's electronic transistor from Silicon now.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   Are they?
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   They go to light-based forms.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.040]   Pretty soon, we'll all have brains.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.040]   That's wrong.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   I broke your own computer.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   Xbox 360 Elite.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   Yes.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.240]   Yeah, what is that, by the way?
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.240]   It's a 360.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.920]   It's a HDMI 120-gig-way hard drive, colored black instead of base.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   And $76 more.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.160]   And then it becomes the high-end model.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.240]   Basically they're selling a bunch of them, you know.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   It's black though.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.080]   To early adopters and then they basically make it the same colors, everything else.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.000]   I'm glad about it because at least I can get 120-gig hard drive now.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.720]   I think they're keeping it black.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   No.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.720]   I think it's supposedly a limited edition.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.640]   No, I just get backed off on that.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.440]   There was just-- they backed off on that and it will be available.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.440]   So they're not going to do--
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.640]   It will be a separate skew, totally.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.640]   Wow.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   It's kind of sad because there's no built-in HD DVD drive.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.640]   There's, you know, it's--
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.640]   No Wi-Fi.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.840]   That's the big one for me.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.200]   I just don't like having Wi-Fi built into, like, the Wii in the PS3.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   It's kind of convenient.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   And the Apple TV.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   That's a big one.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.240]   That's another $100 premium if you want to add their version of Wi-Fi to that console.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.680]   But I just want it to be quieter.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   That's going to happen.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.560]   I've got one that's not noisy at all.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.560]   You're deep.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:16.160]   I think it's a model in corporate, I believe, a BenQ DVD drive that's significantly quieter
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   than the original.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.160]   PS3 is quiet.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   Yes.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   That it is.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   And I have to say that's the selling--
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   Yeah, the sale of quiet too, by the way.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.600]   If you believe that news report that came out yesterday or the day before from Quato--
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:33.400]   I probably said that wrong-- but PlayStation had an FCC filing for an elite version of
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.400]   the PS3 that incorporated a larger hard drive.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.400]   Which is--
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.400]   And probably--
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.400]   I think it's rumored to be 80 gigs though.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.400]   Yeah, 80 or-- there's no reason they can't even go higher than that as well.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.240]   I think it's kind of stupid because the whole point about the point that Sony was making
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.760]   about the PS3 was that the user could swap out the hard drive manually.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   Why wouldn't you just pick up like 120?
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.320]   Is that only in the premium edition that you can swap out the hard drive?
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   No, you should be able to swap out.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.320]   How can you can't swap it out in the--
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   You can't find it in the source itself.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   The premium edition of it.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.320]   Yeah, but it comes in that funky case.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.320]   And then only Microsoft has a magic key too.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.680]   Well, isn't the drive somehow formatted weird too?
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   Don't you have to somehow get the image over?
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   Yeah, because you can't just put it in the drive.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.680]   You can't switch them between different next boxes.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   Right.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.680]   Next.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   Oh, it's tied to you.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   Well, one of the things is when they're also selling the 120 gig hard drive separately.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.680]   Yeah, what happens to all my content?
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.200]   They comes with a cable.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.400]   And the weird thing is you can only move it one way.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.680]   So you can move content from the 20 gig up to the 120, but you can't go it backwards.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.680]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.280]   And you can't do multiple drives.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.680]   So say you have contents between 220 gigs.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680]   You should have--
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.040]   Right, you're a pirate foiled again.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.120]   Why would I need to pirate anything?
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.040]   But it's also-- you think about all the HD content.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.800]   Well, the fun they're offering on their Xbox Live marketplace as well.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.640]   That's just to give you room for saving those movies you want to download.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.640]   Exactly.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.160]   You download two movies.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.560]   There's no more room on your hard drive.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.560]   Very true.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.560]   They're big.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.560]   But they look good.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.400]   I have to say, this is one place where they really beat Apple TV.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.480]   They've got high def television shows, true high def 720p, and they've got high def movies.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.640]   And then they only rent them.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.160]   The downloads are so huge.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.520]   Well, they take a while, but you just run it.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.000]   You leave your-- that's why I don't like it.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   It's in my bedroom.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Oh, all night.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Oh.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   That is annoying.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   That doesn't bother me because I'm deep, too.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   My wife is in the bedroom.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   It's the way I play it in the bedroom.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   Do you sleep in your game room?
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.560]   It's kind of weird.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.560]   Next question.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.560]   How about that Blu-ray, huh?
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.560]   Excellent.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:27.680]   James Bond, Casino Royale, suddenly taking the lead.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   They sold what?
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.680]   10 million units?
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   Some huge number.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.680]   Like 100,000?
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   Oh, all right.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   10 million, 100,000 was a drill.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:42.280]   It was the first high-def second gen DVD format to make the top 10 on Amazon, which sold about
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.120]   100,000 of the Blu-ray version.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.800]   The death of Blu-ray has been greatly exaggerated on me things.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.320]   No argument, but it's still A, a little early, and B, the other question is, nobody knows
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.360]   how many-- I spent like three hours trying to track down a sales number for the regular
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.960]   DVD version of Casino Royale, which was number one in sales.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.960]   Ah.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.960]   So how many did it sell?
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.720]   100,000 huge for--
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.840]   100,000 is a lot of HD discs.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.840]   That's a lot.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.320]   There was a lot of Blu-ray discs in this case actually.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.800]   No, I'm going to mean a high-def.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.800]   That's the confusing.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.320]   But it may be, you know, you're also talking about Casino Royale being in every supermarket
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.720]   and every, you know, big buy.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.720]   Well, Anne--
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   What's the scale?
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.720]   What?
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.720]   He was the best Bond ever.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.720]   Oh, I just let the new guy?
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.720]   Oh, please.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.720]   What?
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.240]   Nobody in this audience would agree with that.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.240]   You're thinking Sean Cog?
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   No, actually, come on.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.720]   I'm going to imagine to see his secret service.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   More?
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.720]   George Lazenby?
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.720]   Yeah, George Lazenby.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.560]   He got hitched and his wife gets it at the end.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.560]   I mean, come on.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.560]   It's all a saving the best.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.560]   Oh, no.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.560]   I'm going to ask him if he would be with the new guy.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.000]   And then she turns out to-- oh, I don't want to ask--
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   You asked the question.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   How many things is this?
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.560]   I want to give you a thing.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.560]   The best Bond--
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   I like the better, so I'm calling.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   No, no, no.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.560]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   Not the question.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.880]   The question is, is the new guy the best guy?
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.880]   Some people might like Roger Bond.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.400]   How many think Roger Moore is the best Bond ever?
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.400]   Oh, come on.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   Those are the two--
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   Now I know you're lying.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   George Lazenby?
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.400]   Yay.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   Ah.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.400]   There's one that nobody knows.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   There was an--
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.400]   What?
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.400]   I'm a pig.
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.400]   Huh?
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.400]   Timothy Dalton.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.400]   No.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.400]   Come on.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   He hated it.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.400]   He's a different man.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400]   And who's a new guy?
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400]   What's Ronston?
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   Pierce Bronson?
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   Pierce Bronson.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   Oh, boy.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.400]   They're everybody to kill.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.480]   I know we've got a good audience.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.280]   That is obscure.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   Pierce Bronson?
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.280]   [CLICK]
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   [CROWD CHATTER]
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.280]   [CROWD CHATTER]
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.280]   [CROWD CHATTER]
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   Okay, so I said his name.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   And who's the new guy, Craig?
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.280]   What's his name?
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   Craig--
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   The guy he--
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   Do you have a show on the late night?
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   I don't know what his name is.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   Craig Ferguson.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   Craig Ferguson.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.280]   Who thinks he's the best Bond ever?
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   You, you apparently.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.280]   Daniel Craig.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.760]   You-- now come on, Veronica.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   Wasn't he the cutie?
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   Even though he's a year's stick out.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.720]   And his face is totally round and looks like a muppet.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.720]   He's just a few times.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.720]   He looks like a Brit.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.720]   He looks like a--
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.720]   Oh, he does.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.880]   I think he's the best Bond ever.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.480]   This latest Bond movie I think was absolutely awesome.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.720]   And I think it's the first huge blockbuster movie that's been released on HDDV or Blu-ray.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.720]   That's a huge blockbuster.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.720]   I agree.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   And that's why it's showing.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.960]   It would be interesting to see what happens if there's a really, really huge blockbuster
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:15.960]   that comes out on HDDV.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.960]   On HDDV.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   And I just wish they would consolidate.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.760]   I don't know if you have so many holes in it.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.760]   It was ridiculous.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   There are plot lines dropped on the plate.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   Are you saying behind the movie?
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   Are you saying behind the movie?
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.760]   Not holes.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.760]   What's the point in watching it?
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   You're saying there's a plot hole in the Bond movie?
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.760]   All right.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   Next topic.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.760]   Geez.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.760]   How do we even play along?
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.760]   It is talking about intel.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.760]   Just a quick.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   Doesn't Netflix actually provide tracking numbers for what they do in terms of rental sale?
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   I'd be curious about that.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   We probably do.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   I've got to go on there saying.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.000]   So you know, you can only choose Blu-ray or HDDV.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.320]   And if I were to get the LG player, what would I do?
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.320]   Well if you're going to get Casino Royale, that's only on Blu-ray.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.320]   Right.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.600]   So then I have to switch my settings every time I rent a movie or--
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   No, no.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   The LG player will play both.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.680]   You just drop either disk in.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.480]   So you choose Blu-ray for the time because you choose a default.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   So when I order a movie--
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   No, no.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   I mean the player doesn't--
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.480]   I understand.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   I'm talking about Netflix.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   Oh.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   It doesn't have a player have like crippled HDV.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   I just order what movie I want.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   I don't care what--
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   Cripples a strong--
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.480]   There are no HDI, the interactive.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.440]   If you look at the logo on top of the LG player, it's not the official HDDV logo because in order
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.000]   to have that logo, you have to have three things.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.600]   You have to have persistent storage, a piece of flash basically to store bookmarks and
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   things like that.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:25.560]   You have to be able to connect to the internet for everything from interactivity and whatnot.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.480]   The interactive features for like the graphics overlays and stuff.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:32.320]   Fully supported as far as the Blu-ray side of things go, but it's not-- it's all missing
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.640]   as far as HDDV goes.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.280]   I'd like to-- we have a great audience here, the GMT attendees, and I'd like to give them
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.280]   a chance to ask questions.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.360]   So if you have a question, just raise your hand and make your way down to the bottom of
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.600]   the stairs, actually on this side, and then we'll have somebody who can hold the mic up.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.600]   If you have something--
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.680]   Doesn't have to be a question, it could be a comment, could be a suggestion, could be
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.800]   mocking us, could be telling us the actual name of James Bond.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.200]   So Dell is-- so we'll do that in a second, but one more stir before we do.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.200]   Dell is selling Linux.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.760]   Gee, wow, unbelievable.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.480]   Not just on servers, on desktop.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.480]   They're supporting.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.120]   This is the third-time they've done that.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.780]   No, but I mean, I was at the airport, I said, "Oh, they had a big banner," said Dell,
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.780]   Linux, together at last.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:11.780]   I mean, they were making a deal about this.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.240]   And it'd be a deal about five to six years ago.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.240]   No, but only on servers.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   This is on desktops now.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   No.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.240]   Have they said much flavor of Linux?
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.240]   They haven't.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.240]   I'm wondering, Sousa--
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.760]   I think you're allowed to choose when you do your customization.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   Cool.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.760]   I'm not a lot of business.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   I think that's great.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.560]   I want to support if you choose anything, I'm going to support Sousa.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.360]   And I want to get one just to see what they preload on that.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.360]   How badly they can corrupt it, they're going to corrupt it with a machine.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.360]   See if it looks like it's with those blocks?
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.160]   Just crap that expires in 60 days.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.480]   I want to see the great new AOL Linux client.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.480]   That's what I want to see.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.880]   I want to see all the Dell branded applications that should pop up.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.680]   Well Michael Dell's back in charge now, so--
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.680]   He's running the show.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.680]   Give me back my business.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   We like Michael Dell.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.680]   He was the guy who wanted to advertise on Twitter.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:51.680]   Okay.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.680]   So we like him.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   Thanks, Dell.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   Yes.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.680]   Well, let us know.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:59.280]   Vista support now and boot camp, that's good, although obvious.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.200]   I guess the only reason it's significant is because there was some thinking that Leopard,
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   which is going to support boot camp, was being held back because Vista support was so difficult.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   Some people thought that would hold Leopard back to the end of the year now because they've
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.120]   shipped a boot camp to support Vista.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.040]   Everybody says, oh good.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.400]   We'll have Leopard someday.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.400]   When?
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   When?
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.400]   Hopefully before.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.400]   Before this.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   Before the--
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.400]   Before the--
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.400]   Before the--
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.400]   Before the--
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.180]   reading, we should say, in Northern Hemisphere's Springs since we have many Australian listeners
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:33.220]   absolutely. Don't you think? I think so! It's time we stop this Northern Hemisphere show
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:37.060]   get you through a month out there, a quarter, quarters are good. By the end of this second
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:44.080]   quarter, unless your fiscal year is three. Yes Sir, what's your name please? My name
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.580]   is Joe Cunham from Asheville, North Carolina. Hey Joe, how are you? Well personally, I want
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.600]   to thank Alex because this has been an awesome seminar - Best Bang for the Buck, it's been
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.300]   wonderful. And please, when we do another one, everybody come because we'd love to have
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:05.500]   you. My question is, Adobe CS3 has been announced and premieres come back to the Mac. Is this
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:10.020]   a good thing or a file maker, a file called Pro users going to flock or we just go, I
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:15.420]   don't think so. What do you think Patrick Norton? Roger and I have both seen it and
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:21.240]   it's pretty - I was actually in a conversation with the vice president of that division and
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:25.640]   the product manager for Premier about eight months ago and said point blank. They're like,
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.200]   "Oh, you're going to think about converting over to Premier in your production cycle?"
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.600]   And I'm like, "Yeah, just as soon as health freezes over and I have something better."
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.040]   Because I hate Premier, I use Premier 1, I use Premier 2. But even if you loved it,
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:39.000]   if you've used Final Cut, why would you change, right? Well actually, there's a - I can't
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.240]   talk about a number of things, but the new version of Premier - What's that? Why not?
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:50.740]   Because I honor my NDAs. Oh, wait a minute. Yeah, well that's because you signed them.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:55.940]   That's right. I consider it an unethical thing to do. I refuse to sign any NDAs.
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.580]   Well, you can lecture them. I would. Okay, okay. First of all, I had signed one.
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:04.180]   Yeah, okay. I don't sign them because I forget. So tell me about the last time you bought
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:13.260]   a computer product, Mr. Ethics. All right then. So. What? And he's very open and honest
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:19.560]   about that. The thing is that there's some really - it's a really - it's a really - no,
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:23.720]   it's - well, look, I've got issues with Final Cut right now too. You know, Final Cut Express
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.360]   versus Pro, they're different code bases, they screw up video in different and exciting
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:31.760]   ways. Yeah, I love Final Cut Pro, but the new version of Premier looks really, really
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.360]   good. And if they do a competitive upgrade, it's starting to look really compelling to
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.360]   think about walking away from Final Cut. Oh really? Yeah. It seems surprising to me that
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.080]   they'd even try to get into that market. It's a final cut so dumb. It's so dumb.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.080]   Yeah, I'm confused. Yeah.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.080]   No, I'm confused. No, I'm confused.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.160]   You like it or do you not like it? No, if - before I started seeing what's coming out
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.360]   with a new version of Premier, right, the new version of Premier is very exciting. It
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:58.180]   would have to offer something compelling over Final Cut for you. It offers a number of compelling
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:04.180]   things over Final Cut. Like what? He can't talk about it. I'm trying to trick him.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:09.400]   Well, you know, it's the way to go. I won't divulge anything either, but I would say like
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:13.120]   when I actually learned video editing, you learned on Premier and it was a pretty crappy
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.520]   piece of software. But when they actually shipped out Pro for the PC, that was actually
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:20.800]   the first time I could actually use it without it crashing on me repeatedly.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:27.040]   Yeah. What software crashes on? Premier? Yeah. Oh, on Windows. And the thing is when
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:32.480]   they rolled out Premier Pro, that was actually a very stable, usable product that, you know,
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.120]   if you used Adobe Photoshop and all the other Adobe products.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.240]   Sort of the things you would expect from Adobe, like stability and performance. Adobe
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:43.200]   Premier is also the only program that Adobe's ever junked the entire original source code
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.360]   and rewritten it from scratch, which is part of the reason when they went from Premier to
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:53.080]   Premier Pro. Premier Pro started bringing people back to it. They basically, they bought, remember
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:57.160]   the guys who went from play and became Serious Magic? Oh, yeah. They acquired Serious Magic.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:00.440]   They pulled in all of those engineers. So a lot of people who really, really like video
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.840]   and know how video is supposed to look in the real world are influencing not only Premier,
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:09.360]   but also things like Flash, so things like AV Sync, you know, things, little things like
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.160]   that. A lot of the, we should see some really improved things coming out of Flash in the
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.920]   next year. It's kind of funny because in many ways it's a lot more, I'm not sure, forward
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.560]   thinking than most people would imagine a video editing suite would be. Yeah. Compare it.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.760]   I mean, the thing is with Final Cut, it was all kind of geared toward doing kind of cinematic
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.160]   theatrical, you know, either a short movie, a long movie, but it wasn't really designed
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.320]   around, say for example, a news production environment where you can get it. It's not
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:38.600]   designed around a production environment at all. And that's the integration across the
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:45.600]   different applications within CS3 is pretty incredible versus the sort of crap in a box
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.440]   you get because you can't buy. Well, no, you snicker, right? But who here wants to pay,
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:54.440]   you know, how much, how much 13, $1,600 for Final Cut Pro Studio when all you really
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:59.280]   want is to edit video? Oh, right. You know what I mean? It's like, you don't, you know,
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.560]   it's a really, it's a really well thought out suite. It's really going to do an interesting
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:08.840]   experience for it. What's your name? What's your name, sir? Dennis Moore, Lake Tahoe.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:15.240]   Hey, Dennis. Hey, about the Apple TV, everything that I'm reading about it is people want to
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.080]   hack it to make a, make a clock. They already have a significant, yeah. Here's the thing.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.680]   I read someplace the other day that all of those hacked machines when they're calling
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:27.440]   home for updates are all locking up and becoming $300 door stops. Here's what you do. It's
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.440]   very simple. You make an image of the drive before you do anything to it. I think the
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.840]   most important hacks are going to be on external drives. It turns out you can boot a USB drive.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.680]   So I think what you're going to see is all the hacks will move to the external drive.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:44.400]   People will keep their Apple TV intact internally, boot from an external drive with all the hacks
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.160]   they want. If Apple disables it, which they may, who knows? I mean, I would expect they
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:53.840]   would just bring it to you. Can you explain to the listeners out there exactly why any
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.680]   hacks are being done in the first place? What's, in other words, what's wrong with the product
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.040]   that needs to be hacked? Well, a couple of hacks are very popular. One is putting in
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:04.760]   a bigger hard drive. And a 40 gig hard drive is not enough. But of course, the stream's
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.160]   pretty well. But let's say you wanted to put everything locally. The other one is putting
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.320]   a Divx or XVID codec on there. So you can play your XVID movies. And I think this is
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:17.560]   maybe what Apple's worried about is that people would, I don't know, put a bit torrent client
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.760]   on it, put a XVID codec on it, and all of a sudden--
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.960]   Why would they care? Well, you're right. I don't think Apple cares, but I think the
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.360]   movie industry does, and they probably put a lot of pressure on Apple. You're right.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.760]   From Apple's point of view, the more you hack it, the more they sell. They don't care
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.600]   the way they would have put more protection against doing it. They didn't protect it well
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.160]   at all. Well, they want to sell hardware. That's the only reason they're doing it.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.240]   But-- They do with iTunes is to sell hardware. They have to keep the-- If the movie industry
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.400]   gets really unhappy, that can hurt them. And remember, they're trying to get studios to
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.080]   move to iTunes. There's only a handful of them on there now.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:50.320]   Mother's like one. Well, no, no, no. There's some other movie studios who move there, but
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:54.060]   it's, you're right. It's not a lot. So they need to make sure the movie studios play
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:58.120]   ball with them. And I think that's the only reason. Otherwise, yeah. And I think you're
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:02.360]   right, David. That's why they didn't hack proof it. I think that the big hacks will be
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.960]   coming in the next couple of days, and they'll be bootable USB drives. And then, you know,
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.120]   anything you want to do-- Some days, a $300 Mac. Well, it is. It's a penny.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   M.M. It's not the greatest Mac ever, but it's enough to play back. I want to thank everybody
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.560]   here in the audience for putting up with us. You've been a great audience. Thank you for
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.640]   joining us at the GMT conference. And it's been so much fun getting back to the original
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:27.500]   Twit panel. We really appreciate Patrick Norton from DL.TV. Thank you for being here.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.860]   Roger Chang, also from DL.TV. It's really great to see you again. Come back again. We
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:37.380]   need more military expertise on the panel. It's important to have you. From revision
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:42.020]   three, David Prager. Every time I see you, you've got new announcements, new shows, things
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:46.100]   are coming along. It looks like revision three is doing. Well, J. Edelson, itself by Southwest
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:50.740]   said he believes that the Apple TV in conjunction with revision three is the beginning of IPTV.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:56:00.160]   We'll see. I gave him a big opening there. I don't know. Hey, from Buzz out loud. And
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:05.840]   ladies and gentlemen, the vlogging air guitar champion. Let's see a little air guitar of
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:12.680]   Veronica Belmont. It's great to have you. I'll see you in World of Warcraft. You know,
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.960]   there's a lot of people in that guild. There's like a thousand people. I thought it was exclusive.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:23.440]   It was podcasters. Everybody in the world didn't. There's millions of wild players.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.800]   So a thousand could be exciting. I guess you're right. What level do I have to get to before
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.440]   I can actually be part of your group? Well, I've seen you log on a bunch of times and
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:37.120]   then I write to you and you never answer. That's the way it does with email. Really?
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.880]   I've been looking for it and see you. I'm twister. Twister. You've been messaging me?
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:47.080]   Oh, I'm sorry. I'm getting there. I don't want to really announce myself until I'm a
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.560]   level 20. I'm a warrior. You said you needed some warriors. I thought I could tank for
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:57.240]   you. I'm really working on that. Also, what a geek. I'm sitting playing this game. My
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:01.760]   son, my 12-year-old son comes up and says, "Dad, that game is only for really major
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:06.000]   geeks." And he has his friends come over and said, "Look, my dad's such a geek. What
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:13.740]   am I doing?" He may mocks me. Also from DLTV and PC Magazine, they're high definition
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:17.480]   television expert Robert Herrins. So great to have you back. Thank you. Now that the
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.680]   bubble's out of your eye, I hope you'll make it more. It's dissolving slowly. It's taking
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.640]   its freaking time. Don't explain it. It's like a morning. It's wind on. It's a really
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:29.880]   peaceful water. And I saved the best for last. Center stage, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:34.480]   Dvorak.org/plot. Good to have you back too, John. Thank you very much. Thank you all
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.480]   for joining us. Another Twitch is in the can.
