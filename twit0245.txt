[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.440]   All the tech news from the week.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.720]   And boy, this has been a week, not for really good tech news,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.240]   but certainly for fascinating tech news.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.520]   And we've got a great panel here to talk about it starting off
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.040]   with-- from CBS.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.360]   She is a blogger for the CBS Digital.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.480]   What is your title sure?
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.400]   The digital?
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.440]   We say digital correspondence.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.040]   I blog and video blog on CBS News.com.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.080]   I have a blog called On The Scene,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.920]   Right Tracks Social Trends in Pop Culture.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.960]   And she's joining us from Los Angeles?
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.440]   Yes, Hollywood.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.080]   Great to see you.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.520]   Hello.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.720]   Represent.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.120]   So represent CBS.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.640]   Now represent in ABC from Good Morning America.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   Ms. Becky Worley.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.800]   Hello, Becky.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.040]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.040]   Original producer for the screensavers and call for help.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.040]   I should add.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.040]   It does date me.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.920]   And lately, you've been covering kind of--
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.240]   not only tech, but like consumer crap.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.440]   Shammaw, baby.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.720]   Shammaw.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.400]   She's a shamaw queen.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.200]   In studio with me today, I'm very happy to welcome Ms. Natalie
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.800]   Del Conny, also from CBS via CNET.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.360]   Natalie.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.920]   Hello.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.680]   Great to have you.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.160]   I'm back.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.320]   Yeah, and your mom's here.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   I asked a bra my sidekick, my mom.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.200]   Hi, mom.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.560]   She'll behave herself over there.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.720]   She's got a glass of wine.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.920]   She'll sit quietly.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.200]   Is it OK for me to say that you will be a mom soon yourself?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.320]   Yes, that's OK.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.920]   We can talk about that, if you want.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.120]   Not very much.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.040]   Not much to say.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.040]   There's not much to say.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.240]   No, I've just--
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.200]   I've got a baby loading.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.760]   And you do?
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.560]   In either late July or early August, depending.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.120]   I'm hoping for late July, just because this is not very
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.800]   comfortable.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.400]   It's hot.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.560]   Yeah, it's hot.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.280]   That's awesome.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.720]   Summer birthday parties.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.040]   You can have them outside.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.800]   When were yours born?
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.880]   When were the twins born?
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.960]   January.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.480]   Oh.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.000]   Oh, you've got the winter babies.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.120]   But we do the half birthday.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.640]   We have a lu out for them in the summer.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.600]   And then they don't get to have a birthday party in January.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.760]   So I just like to work with them.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.240]   That's what Kami does.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.720]   That's cute.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.080]   I'd like it.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.280]   I haven't really thought that far in advance, actually.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.400]   I've just sort of thought that I'll
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.000]   have a nice fall maternity leave.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.320]   That's all I really care about, right?
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.240]   Nice.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.160]   I forget that they have birthdays
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.840]   and that they become actual people.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.800]   Yeah, don't worry about that.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.000]   I'm under this illusion that I'll just have this baby
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.840]   and then go back to my life the way it was before.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.360]   But let me speak.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.800]   Exactly how it works.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.880]   They're not big bags of need for two years or anything like that.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.200]   No, it's easy.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.720]   There's nothing.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.840]   There's no--
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.680]   And changing a diaper.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.120]   The nice thing about that, the learning curve
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.960]   is very, very brief.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.480]   You pick that up right away.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.040]   But I should say, as a father of a teenager
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.960]   about to go to college, you are saving for college now,
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   aren't you?
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.320]   Well, I asked Jill Schlesinger from MarketWatch.com
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.440]   what I should be doing.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.040]   So I've at least asked the right questions.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.960]   What did he tell you?
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.560]   I did this research and I found out
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.880]   I was supposed to be for the two kids putting $1,000 a month
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   away, starting at age zero.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.240]   Wait, what?
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.480]   I got to leave your scary--
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.640]   $1,000 a month.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.600]   And I said, well, what I did is I said, well, screw that.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.280]   I can't do that.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.840]   So I'll just make more money later.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   Uh-huh.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.680]   And that didn't work out.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   How's that working?
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.160]   Because now she's going to college.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.840]   She's going to college.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.160]   And that worked, I guess?
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.080]   I can pay for it.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.960]   OK, well, that's good.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.560]   I can pay for it.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.280]   That's good.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.760]   Yeah, I asked about the New York plan.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.600]   But preschool.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.120]   I don't know.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.480]   You signed up for preschool yet?
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.000]   No.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.640]   Are you supposed to--
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.960]   No, you're just scaring her.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   Yeah, what's going on is speaking to speaking baby.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   This is good birth control for Shira.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.040]   This is why I will be representative of a single non-child
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.280]   bearing.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.960]   All right, I'm going to stop talking about that
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.440]   and start talking about the tech news.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.960]   That's my message.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.280]   And the big story.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.320]   And I have to say that's very interesting,
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.200]   because you guys beforehand were talking about iPad,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.240]   because both Natalie and Becky had iPads pre-release,
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.360]   to show on CBS's early show, right?
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.320]   Well, Becky had it before I did, because she had a taped package
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.440]   that ran with her piece.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.560]   I watched very studiously.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.480]   I only had it Thursday before it came out.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.440]   So how does that work?
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.400]   We have all the negotiations to get these devices in advance
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.080]   from Apple for the networks.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.560]   And it's a big deal.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.120]   And you have to work it out.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.400]   And so we both got ours on Thursday.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.920]   And there's a hierarchy of which show gets to go first.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.040]   And that's all negotiated.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.160]   So it's kind of silly madness.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.360]   It is really silly madness.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.640]   I had asked them--
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.880]   I had originally planned to have it on Friday.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.920]   And then they mentioned that we might be able to get it
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.720]   for Thursday's broadcast.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.120]   And I said, well, can you maybe tell me in what hour
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.680]   the other morning shows are going to have it?
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.000]   Because otherwise, the control room
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.320]   screams that someone else has it.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.200]   And we didn't have it.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.160]   So at least I know.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.280]   And they're kind of like, no.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.040]   So that you're saying they're watching GMA.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.400]   And they're going, oh my god, GMA's got a GMA's got a GMA's got
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.440]   a quick go out and get it.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.960]   Right.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.760]   And it's really my intention to scoop Becky at it.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.760]   It's just only.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.480]   I don't care.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.640]   It's more my intention to not get screened from the control room.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.920]   They want to scoop Becky.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.600]   Well, they want to scoop GMA, right?
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.360]   Or at least have it in the same--
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.640]   Well, this is apropos because really what happened this week,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.640]   the big story of the week, of course,
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.360]   has stolen/lost iPhone.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.720]   And the big story really is Gizmodo and Engaget
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.240]   trying to scoop one another, isn't it?
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   It's not--
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.160]   Having that iPhone is not that big a deal.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.600]   First of all, OK, accepting that it is from Apple,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.000]   which apparently is, doesn't mean it's the--
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.240]   It was 100%.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.800]   Yeah, it's 100% because Apple said it's ours.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.280]   We want it back.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.800]   But there's no guarantee it's the next iPhone.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.160]   It's a prototype.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.960]   You held it, right?
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.840]   Becky, you actually held it.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.240]   Yeah, I was the only one who called.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.000]   I didn't believe him.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.640]   So I called the Gizmodo guys and said,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.840]   I want to come down and see it.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.440]   So I took a crew and I went down to Fremont
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.120]   and found the blogger's house who had it in his possession.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   And he wouldn't let us film it really closely
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.200]   because they're holding on to it for exactly the reason
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   you just said.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.000]   Was this Jason Chen that you were--
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.040]   Yeah, Jason.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.720]   Super nice guy.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.680]   But they wanted to maintain exclusive control of the video
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.480]   so that they would get the eyeballs at gizmodo.com.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.120]   But yeah, I held it.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.200]   And if it was not the final version, I will be shocked
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.760]   because it just seems too late in the game for this to have
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.040]   as much polish as it did.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.160]   And so I really think it's very close to the real deal.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.480]   That's funny that you say polish because when I first saw it,
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.920]   I thought, oh, I don't know if that looks very apple-like.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.160]   It's got visible screws and square edges.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.520]   Right.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.120]   But maybe it just doesn't photograph well.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.520]   Andy, I love the industrialness of it
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.800]   that I felt that that was intentional design work.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.400]   It wasn't like it was Cluji or just a rapid prototype.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.160]   It was like trying to be more angular and industrial.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.920]   Instead of a rocker, for instance, for volume,
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.880]   it has two buttons.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.920]   And--
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.720]   The only--
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.560]   Apple never comes up with the final thing.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.240]   They always make you want more.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.120]   So even if they're giving us probably a camera right now
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.320]   and a video camera, a better video camera,
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.360]   I feel like there's always going to be more things we want
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:22.400]   so that they could come out with more types of iPhones.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.720]   Well, more than that, they're doing the Detroit thing, aren't they?
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.280]   They're saying, oh, this year, it's
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.000]   this year we're going to do industrial,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.280]   so that the Swoopy-Dupy design of last year seems outmoded.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:35.520]   Right.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.120]   And if you look at some of the other phones that
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.840]   are coming out like the Evo and the HTC Detroit,
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.920]   they do look a bit more boxy.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.480]   They have very sleek lines along the front.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.000]   It's a new style.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.440]   How interesting.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.640]   But the new style is to sort of have boxy edges
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.200]   and a sleek front and not really rounded back at all.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.800]   And then the thing about how Apple is always a piece of art,
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.320]   that's what makes their pieces.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.080]   It's not just like a piece of hardware.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.880]   It's actually something that becomes like a lifestyle accessory.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.800]   And Johnny, I--
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.600]   And that makes it so special.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.240]   He's always thinking about, well, what's
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.760]   the trend?
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.520]   What's the new thing?
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.560]   He's a designer.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.520]   And if you think of the skepticism early on
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.480]   was that it was too industrial to be a John Ive production.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.160]   But I think that this is a departure and an intentional move.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.280]   I'm also wondering, just from holding it in my hand,
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.880]   it felt less likely to slip out of your hand.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.160]   I know that sounds ridiculous, but with the amount of cracked
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.320]   iPhone screens that we have, that may be a consideration.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:30.880]   I don't know.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.080]   How about the iPad design?
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.680]   Is it Echo?
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.600]   The iPad design?
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.360]   Is that part of it?
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.960]   Maybe, because the iPad's got some square edges too.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.560]   I didn't feel that as much when I held it in my hand,
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.600]   because it was such--
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.480]   I just automatically felt the departure
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.760]   from the existing iPhone.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.760]   So I didn't feel like it was an iPad compliment.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.680]   I was also just really fixated on the camera on the front.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.920]   I thought that was so cool.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.720]   Let's talk about that.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.600]   A front-facing camera.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.480]   That's a real departure for Apple.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.880]   No kids done that for years, but you can't call anybody,
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.040]   because nobody else has one.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.640]   So it's like a feature without a user.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.480]   Right.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.720]   In fact, Tony Wang upstairs has a Nokia phone,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.640]   and I have an N900.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.760]   He keeps saying, put "fring" on it,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.600]   so we can call each other.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.280]   I want to try this.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.000]   Is Apple-- but Apple single-handedly,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.280]   just because of the number of adopters,
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.680]   could make front-facing phones be ubiquitous?
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.180]   Right.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.760]   I'm thinking about the fact that they're saying,
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.520]   well, you don't really need it for an iPad,
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.160]   because you wouldn't use that for video chat,
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.800]   but you'd use an iPhone for video chat.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.640]   I guess you would.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.160]   So--
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.840]   Once again, they're doing that, because the next version of the iPad
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.320]   will have that front-facing phone, hopefully.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.040]   But then that's why now you'll get the iPhone
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.080]   with the front-facing phone.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.000]   You'll have your iPad.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.400]   It makes it so there's a separation between the two.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.000]   So you have a reason to have both of them.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.840]   So what's your guess?
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.960]   I don't think that that iterative release of features
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.640]   is just a marketing ploy to get you to buy more.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.280]   I think it's because they're desperately
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.160]   trying to hit price points that are appropriate now,
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.440]   and that they can't put it all into one device at one time.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.840]   4.99 was critical.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.120]   A critical thing for the iPad.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.320]   They had to do 4.99, right?
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:01.640]   Right.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.400]   And I think that they're also sticking to a production cycle
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.120]   of what is going to not only be released but get news.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.640]   They don't want us this month to be talking about the iPhone.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.200]   This month, we were supposed to be talking about the 3G iPad.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.680]   They've really controlled the news cycle.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.840]   That's a few weeks away.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.400]   And then we were just last week talking about the new Macs,
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.160]   and then the 3G iPhone.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.800]   And then iPhone 4.0 was in the interim,
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.600]   and then the software, rather, and then the fourth iPhone
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.120]   coming out.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.920]   So we're not supposed to be talking about this right now.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.680]   So you guys completely reject the thought
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.120]   that had been floating around.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.400]   I had a number of radio stations call me and say,
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.440]   this was an Apple plant, wasn't it?
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.120]   I know on firsthand knowledge it was not.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.200]   Couldn't have been.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:45.840]   No, I know because--
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.480]   How do you know?
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.400]   Because I have comments that I couldn't put on the air
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.520]   that Steve Jobs personally made phone calls to get it back.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.120]   That's-- now, so OK, somebody asked Nick Denton at Gizmodo,
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.240]   did Jobs call you?
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.720]   And Nick said, if he did, I couldn't say anything about it,
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.560]   which I thought was his way of pretending
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.280]   that he got a call from Steve Jobs.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:08.800]   Probably.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.520]   He is like the mofiosos, Steve Jobs.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.800]   He may have called someone else at Gizmodo.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.880]   OK, there's a scooplet.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.400]   Hey!
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.040]   OK, wow.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.560]   I think that the other thing is that there may have also
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.160]   been the mention of the word "police," which has happened.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.840]   Yeah, there is a task force in Santa Clara Valley, which
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.200]   includes police, forensics experts, and supposedly,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.600]   although the DA in San Mateo is not commenting,
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.920]   but supposedly this task force is investigating.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.880]   So that's going to-- before we get to that--
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.280]   because I do want to get to the story of stolen versus found
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.800]   and the criminal investigation.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.240]   But let's just finish our discussion of the hardware,
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.320]   because I think that that's of merit.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.640]   If it has a front-facing camera, it's
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.480]   not for a phone call.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.600]   It's for iChat, right?
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.920]   Well, that's my question is, do you
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.480]   think it will be Skype compatible,
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.240]   or this will be the great question of how much Apple
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.680]   is willing to clamp down on apps to promote their own software?
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.320]   Will it only work with iChat?
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:11.820]   Huh.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.760]   Oh, that's an interesting--
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.000]   I hadn't even considered that.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.160]   What do you use it with?
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   What do you use it with?
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.440]   You don't think Frank or--
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.240]   Frank is available on the iPhone.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:19.740]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.400]   But if you didn't need an app, if you would just
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.960]   call it, it says accept video.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.840]   So if 18-- oh, this is interesting.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.760]   AT&T says, yeah, we'll support video calls,
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.120]   but you've got to be using an iPhone.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.520]   Or you have to pay more to receive and have video calls.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.720]   What about that?
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.220]   I know.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:39.720]   OK.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.220]   Would you--
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:40.720]   Would you--
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   --try all of these video calls?
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.880]   Would you pay for that?
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.880]   I would-- if it was $3 more a month, how much money?
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.440]   It depends.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.360]   If it was $5, it might be useful--
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.200]   Would you like--
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.640]   See, this is--
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.160]   --like that.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.240]   Enter a cord it.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:53.720]   But I don't know.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.760]   Let's say if it doesn't cost anything.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.880]   I remember in 1965-- this is how old I am.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.400]   In 1964, going to the World's Fair in New York City.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:00.920]   AT&T--
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.420]   Hey, back.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.080]   Hey, man.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.720]   Oh, shut up, Worley.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.840]   You're a little young whipper snapper.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   I'll dance you're a grave, Worley.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.240]   So when I was a young man in 1964,
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.280]   I went to the World's Fair.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.800]   And I remember AT&T had--
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.240]   it was just like in 2001.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.440]   Remember that, where they made a call on the AT&T picture
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.360]   phone.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.480]   And they said, by the year 1970, everybody
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.320]   will have a picture phone.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.360]   And it turned out nobody wanted a picture phone.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.400]   Because when you get up and answer the phone,
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.960]   do you really want a camera?
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.480]   Right.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.240]   Well, we don't even know--
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.320]   Well, we don't even know those though.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.840]   Most people don't even look good in webcams.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.120]   I mean, you ladies look beautiful, of course.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.200]   But I think most of the time, I answer the picture phone
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.400]   or any kind of video chat.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.560]   And I'm like, oh, I look like Kurt.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.280]   You don't turn on the auto answer on Skype with the video.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.280]   Hell no.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.780]   Hey.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.360]   You know what though?
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.680]   But here's the difference.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.720]   I answer video calls all the time looking like crap.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.800]   And I immediately turn the computer around
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.600]   and point it towards my kids.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   I'm sorry, dude.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.320]   Can you still look at my parents on a video phone?
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.760]   You think people-- now, come on, Shira.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.120]   No, we're waiting for that.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.200]   Shira, come on.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.960]   Look at Shira Lazar.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.640]   I had a professional make up.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.520]   I think you had somebody come in.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.000]   Come on.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.600]   I keep them in my pocket.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.320]   I don't think you get up in the morning in the phone rings
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.360]   and you turn on the camera.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:18.880]   I don't.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.880]   No way.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.480]   This face doesn't wake up in the morning.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.200]   And I think most humans--
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.240]   I'll leave you three out of this.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.600]   But most humans don't want camera phones.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.240]   No, but what about to talk to a boyfriend?
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.400]   You're doing a long distance relationships for businesses.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.000]   If you don't have your laptop on you,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.080]   but you want to see the person you're having a meeting with it,
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.600]   it totally makes sense.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.520]   So you're saying Skype has kind of conditioned us
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.040]   to want this down?
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.920]   Well, we are the generation that is constantly
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.280]   motivated to share everything about ourselves.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.120]   So more are likely than not.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.440]   We do want that kind of thing.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.280]   My mom and I were just having a conversation
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.120]   when we were driving over here when we weren't screaming
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.880]   at each other over my driving about how
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.440]   she's going to go to the Apple Store and get a new Mac today.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.120]   And I want to show her how to use video chat
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.160]   because I'm having a baby on the other coast.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.640]   And my kid won't know her crazy--
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.320]   It's great for grandma's.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.880]   No, no, that Skype is great is made for grandma's.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.440]   Yeah, it's made for the parental relationship.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.040]   But again, I stick with the fact
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.240]   that we're all egomaniacs and we want to share as much as possible.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.160]   And we all realize that all the Nokia users
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.800]   have been using this type of stuff in South America
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.880]   and in Europe for years.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.680]   Well, they have.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.040]   OK.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.560]   So it's not uncommon to see people do video.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.800]   Do they use it for phone calls or video chat?
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.680]   How are they using it?
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.360]   Well, the thing is phone calls become video chat.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.160]   It's just like another--
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.280]   an upgrade from your phone call to talk to someone.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.360]   You say, hey, besides talking if you're in the mood
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.240]   to talk to them in a bit more of a personal way,
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.680]   can we do video now?
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.040]   I just think it's just an added extension
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.880]   to your phone calls and your relationships.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.240]   I don't think we need to overthink it.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.960]   And it's not like people are just using this for reasons
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.680]   like you to create professional podcasts and do video interviews.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.720]   People actually use it to connect with people.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.120]   And clearly, Apple doesn't do anything accidental.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.280]   If they're putting a front-facing camera on--
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.080]   But no way AT&T is going to put this on their--
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:12.600]   You don't think so?
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.080]   --so network.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.720]   I think this is going to be Wi-Fi only,
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.280]   because the way that they're getting hammered
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.600]   are ready for instability, that they're
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.160]   going to put this kind of data load on their network,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.120]   I don't buy it.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.560]   I think AT&T is a denial.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.760]   They're selling AT&T unlimited access on an iPad
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.880]   for $30 a month.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.480]   And the AT&T guy said, no, when they say on the limited,
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.960]   we don't mean 5 gigabyte unlimited.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.520]   We mean you could stream movies all day all night.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.640]   I think AT&T is a denial about their network.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.360]   I think that they don't really--
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.560]   they don't admit that there's a problem.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.280]   They don't read consumer reports, apparently.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.640]   Apparently.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.960]   Maybe they're just going to blow it out
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.880]   before Verizon swoops in.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.040]   Yeah, when is that the question?
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.160]   When is Verizon going to come in?
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.560]   Is this with the next one?
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.960]   Are we going to see Verizon at all?
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.120]   OK, conspiracy theory.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.040]   How about this?
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.360]   Front-facing phone is-- well, no, it was a GSM phone.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.120]   Shoot, never mind.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.880]   Yeah, and I actually asked Jason when he did the autopsy
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.600]   on the new iPhone if he could tell from the innards
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.720]   if it was CDMA.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.360]   And he said he couldn't tell.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.920]   They said GSM.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.920]   Somebody said GSM.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.080]   So somebody figured that out when they disassembled it.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.680]   Interesting.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.040]   That wasn't Jason, because he didn't.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.280]   He said he couldn't tell.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   Well, maybe it isn't a GSM.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.160]   Maybe that was a typo.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.720]   Hard to know.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.360]   I mean, there's definitely a lot of conspiracy theories
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:22.720]   of foot.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.040]   And I know one of the things they've
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.440]   said about this phone story breaking early
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.640]   is that it may hurt sales of the iPhone today,
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.760]   because people are now excited too early for the release
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.640]   later this summer of the new iPhone.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.960]   And that would lend credence to a criminal or a civil prosecution.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.680]   That they've done harm.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.280]   There was commercial harm.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.080]   And in that case, Gismoto may be at fault.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.240]   But I don't think from a criminal statute
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.320]   based on the California laws, because it
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.240]   was a real catch 22 that Apple had
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.080]   to claim the device in order for Gismoto
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.640]   to be responsible for saying that it was theirs.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.920]   Well, let's talk about that in a second.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.200]   Is there culpability?
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.320]   And even more than that, the journalistic issue of--
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.840]   Well, didn't they pay $10,000 for the $5,000?
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   $5,000?
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   $5,000.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.840]   So hang on.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.600]   I want to talk about that, because I've
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.160]   got three journalists on the line here, Natalie Delcotti,
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.360]   from CBS and CNET, Sheryl Azar from CBS,
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.160]   and from Good Morning America and ABC.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.360]   Becky Worley, where's the NBC correspondent?
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.800]   I should have gotten Clayton Morris and then Foxwood,
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.960]   at least, ever.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.240]   They're with Kathy Lee and Hoda.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.840]   They're on the air like 23 hours today in the half gals.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.320]   You guys, I'm glad to know competition is still alive
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.360]   and well in the dying media.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.200]   You guys, just fight over the scraps as you go down in flames.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.920]   It's OK with me.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.280]   Hey, I do want to talk about Citrix, our great sponsor,
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.560]   and a new product from Citrix.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.920]   It's very cool for anybody who has to do training online.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.000]   It's called Go To Training.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.320]   Now, if you've ever taken corporate training online
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.480]   and used some of these awful solutions,
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.720]   this is an opportunity to call your training manager
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.200]   and say, there's something better.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.760]   If you're a trainer, this is an opportunity to try for free.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.320]   Go to training for 30 days.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.560]   Of course, it's got, as its backbone,
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.680]   the really state of the art top of the line sharing
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.920]   that Citrix is famous for with Go To Meeting, Go To My PC,
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.880]   Go To Assist.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.560]   But then they've added-- that gives you screen sharing.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.440]   You can pass control from presenters to presenters.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.560]   You can have multiple presenters in different locations.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.400]   Built-in voiceover IP.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.480]   I used to go to meeting on the iPad the other day,
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.840]   and they could hear me and I could hear them.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.360]   It was wild.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.600]   We didn't have to make a phone call.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.640]   It was all there in the iPad.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.560]   Chat built-in.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.120]   This is for the training stuff.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.120]   Session recording.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.880]   So you can give the training once recorded
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.680]   and then make it available for the future.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.600]   Plus, there are special features like quizzes, polls,
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.720]   up to 200 participants live.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.400]   There's a content library that goes to the training.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.520]   So you can upload any kind of document
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.800]   or link to any website and make a training curriculum
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.600]   that your trainees can look at ahead of time
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.840]   or after.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.800]   The completely customizable tests, polling, chat, feedback.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.480]   I can go on and on, but I think the best way to do this
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.120]   is to try it.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.760]   If you head up a training program, test drive it for free.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.360]   At gototraining.com, you don't need a special coupon
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:26.680]   or anything.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.000]   Just go to gototraining.com.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.520]   If you've ever been in a bad training session
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.000]   and you want to send a note to the trainer and say,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   hey, go to training.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.240]   Or if you're an IT manager, you might
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.960]   want to bring it up at your next meeting.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.480]   Gototraining.com.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.000]   Give it a try.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I think you'll like it.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.960]   I have a question about how you sent audio over the iPad
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.520]   when you used it.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.480]   Isn't that cool?
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.400]   How did you do that?
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.520]   It was go to meeting, and there's a go to meeting app.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.640]   And they were already in the meeting.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.200]   And I launched a meeting all the time I'm hearing them.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.400]   And there's a mic on the iPad.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   Are you sending--
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.240]   OK, you were sending an audio.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.600]   And so I said, oh, I can hear you.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.600]   And they said, yes, and we can hear you.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.360]   It was like, it was kind of a surprise.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.280]   And how is that, Mike?
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.200]   It's good, I guess.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.880]   It's a very good mic.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.160]   In fact, if you use drag and dictate on the iPad,
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.320]   it does a very good job.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.280]   You can record.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.120]   It was interesting that they built a mic in.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.160]   It's right next to the mic port on the iPad
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.880]   is right next to the headphone jack.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.000]   There's a little hole there.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I have not noticed that.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.920]   I could speak right into it.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   Well, you're using a netbook.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.200]   I noticed not an iPad.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.960]   This is-- I have an iPad, though, with me.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.800]   You all have an iPad?
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.640]   Sure you have an iPad?
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.240]   I still-- I'm waiting for the 3G.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:33.880]   Me too.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.960]   Well, no, I'm not waiting.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.440]   I've already bought eight.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.840]   You got a training iPad.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.440]   I got an email from Apple saying,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.320]   you can't buy anymore.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.920]   We're canceling your order.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.440]   Now you have to go in disguise.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.480]   I have to put a mustache on an order.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.920]   I'll buy one for you, Leo.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.480]   I'll buy it next to you.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.200]   Thank you, Shira.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:50.760]   It's OK.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.400]   I'm covered.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.600]   I got Lisa, our CEO, to do it.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.760]   She ordered a few more.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.640]   But I have a total of eight.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.920]   Some for contest giveaways, but some for family members.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.120]   My 80-year-old father-in-law is going to get one.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.200]   It's going to be great for him.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.880]   Did you see there was a video on YouTube of a nine-year-old
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.920]   on an iPad?
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.480]   And she was sitting--
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.200]   Oh my god, it was amazing.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.880]   She just first started using it in her life.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.720]   First computer was an iPad, yeah.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.840]   I'm actually using the iPad to keep track of knitting patterns.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.280]   That's a knit baby blanket.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.320]   So I'm using it for really old school.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.160]   What's so funny?
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.520]   Actually, I just used a notepad.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.680]   And then I keep track of the road.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.160]   You just like XXOOX.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.240]   Yeah, knit, purl, all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.440]   And I'm probably the only person in the universe
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.120]   using the iPad for knitting.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.680]   I bet you, though, now somebody's
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.040]   going to write some knitting stuff for mine.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.160]   I wish there was an app for that, actually.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.120]   In fact, my mom had to continue to use Windows
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.720]   because she uses a knitting/weaving app that
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.760]   was only Windows.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.240]   Really?
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:44.760]   What is it?
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.480]   There isn't anything good on the Mac.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.440]   No.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.680]   And the iPad would be perfect for that.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.760]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.920]   It'd be a perfect platform.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.720]   Because you could just touch it and tap it twice to be perfect.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.400]   And say, yes, I did that row.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   Wow.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.520]   Wow, the estrogen is just seeping.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.800]   I know this podcast.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.720]   Men--
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   Men--
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   Men--
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   Men--
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   What are you talking about?
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.120]   Oh, yeah, dudes are radical knitters, Leo.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.320]   Some men do.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.160]   We've gotten some emails on Buzz Out Loud.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.720]   There are men who knit.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.800]   I wonder if this would be the same conversation
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.600]   if Kevin Rose was here.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.120]   I bet Kevin Rose knits.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.120]   OK.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   I think he's--
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.560]   Don't you think he's the type?
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   He drinks tea.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   He uses types if they know how.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.120]   Like red, organic red.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.000]   Yeah, he knits his own beer coosies for food workies.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.680]   All right, let's talk about $5,000.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.720]   Nick Denton, who runs Gawker, has said--
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.760]   and many times he makes no bones about it--
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.760]   he does checkbook journalism.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.640]   Apparently-- and correct me if I'm wrong-- but apparently,
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.000]   this phone--
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.840]   and we know the gizmodo story, but we don't really
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.200]   know the provenance of this phone.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.400]   But the guy who had the phone apparently
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.960]   offered it to Engadget.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.840]   Engadget took a picture but didn't buy it.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.360]   Then went to gizmodo, and Nick Denton said,
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.120]   I'll give you $5,000 for it.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.080]   And now he says he actually didn't make any money off of it
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.320]   because he couldn't sell any new ads.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.320]   Oh, yes.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.240]   But the traffic was insane.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.240]   They had in one hour on the day that this broke.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.640]   They had a million uniques in one hour.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.680]   That's crazy.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   So tell me he didn't make money.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.720]   Nick Denton was one of them.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.280]   The obvious and just say that the journalistic ethics
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.040]   are questionable if not downright sleazy.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   But--
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.640]   He says he talked to his lawyer, who was not a lawyer,
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.400]   but a barrister, a British lawyer, who said,
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.960]   oh, you all right, go ahead and do it.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.080]   And then now, if you look at the California statutes,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.280]   it's very clear-- for instance, if I came to you,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.920]   Natalie and said, hey, I got a Rolex.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.440]   It's only $300 you want it.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.320]   And you bought it, you'd be culpable
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.280]   because that's a sternal stolen property.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.880]   Even if you didn't know it was stolen,
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.760]   if you may know attempt to find the owner.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.760]   Because it's suspect.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.800]   It's pretty obvious that Apple isn't offering him
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.280]   this iPhone for $5,000.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   Somebody else is.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.160]   It's clearly not legitimately.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.400]   And even if it's found in a bar stool--
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.480]   and I don't buy the story, by the way, because what's
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.200]   the first thing-- OK, I know that, Natalie, you've never
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.120]   been in a bar.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.600]   But, sure, you've been to a bar.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.600]   Tell me that.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.520]   What's the--
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.440]   If you found some keys on the floor in a bar, sure--
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.080]   If you-- If you-- If you-- If you have brunch, someone left
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.720]   their iPhone on the table, and I had to remind them,
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.920]   and it happens all the time.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.760]   But what would you do?
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:32.720]   Now listen to me.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.880]   What would you do if you were in a bar or a restaurant
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.240]   and you found some keys?
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.280]   What's the first thing you do?
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.960]   Do you take it home and call Apple?
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.360]   He says he tried to chase down the person who left it.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.960]   P.S. You give it to the freaking bartender.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.840]   The first thing you do is--
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.340]   Right.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.560]   --looks like a free tree.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.280]   I've had me--
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.880]   I've had her iPhone.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.000]   Not I've had her iPhone.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.360]   I'm mixing up all my eyes.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.040]   But the iPhone, I mean, probably he was thinking, OK,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.000]   I'm going to play around with this,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.520]   take some pictures, do a video, and then find the owner.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.360]   You're a journalist.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.400]   That's a huge scoop.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.400]   But he wasn't a journalist.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.440]   We don't know who this guy was.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.400]   Clearly, though.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:05.920]   He was an opportunity.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.960]   But he knew he had a scoop.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.040]   He knew he had a scoop.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:08.720]   Yeah, you did.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.520]   But how did he know?
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   Because it looked like an iPhone.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   Right.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.200]   Because it's the same thing that was the most amazing
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.080]   about the whole deal was the custom case.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.080]   Did you see the case too?
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.760]   So I told the case apart, and it was incredible.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.160]   So inside the case, it was completely fabricated,
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.240]   a real iPhone and existing today iPhone
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.600]   would not fit in this case.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.200]   It was custom made.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.920]   And inside it had a scored grid,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.880]   and then it had a cushioned backing.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.240]   So the new prototype fit in perfectly,
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.200]   and then the back looked exactly like the existing iPhone.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.480]   So if anything, my guess--
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.360]   this is a total guess--
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.760]   is that poor [BLEEP] said something
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.240]   to the effect of, well, I test out Apple iPhone.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.240]   He said something.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.600]   This is a total guess.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.360]   I have no idea.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.000]   You must have.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.040]   Well, and the influence of German beer.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.600]   Or roofies.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.160]   And poor roofies.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.240]   Roofies, and then he left it, and then the guy knew.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.760]   You know what?
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.960]   You're right, because otherwise, how would this person know
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.040]   it was something worth anything at all?
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.720]   Right.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.880]   But I do think he knew, because if he didn't,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.680]   he would have left it with a bartender.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.320]   And you don't go through-- he had figured out
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.240]   that it belonged to--
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.320]   He went to the Facebook application.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.680]   I once actually was at a party.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.160]   And it was Julia Allison's birthday,
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.600]   and she showed up at this party and lost her phone.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.480]   And someone gave it to me and said,
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.880]   let's make phone calls and send this to Gawker or something.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   I took the phone.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.800]   Good for you.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.000]   I turned it off.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.160]   Good for you.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.160]   I went home and sent her an email.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.640]   And I think that this speaks to just general etiquette.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.000]   Like, you find something that doesn't belong to you.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.560]   You don't play with it.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.400]   You put it away.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.560]   Give it to someone who can get it back.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.280]   You call a number in the phone and say, hey,
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.040]   do you know this person whose phone this is?
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.920]   Because I just found it.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.640]   Maybe.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.040]   I mean, I would give it to the bartender.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.600]   But maybe you do that.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.640]   But you turn it off.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.560]   I think the first thing to do is to not mess with it.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.280]   So this guy was a software engineer
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   who worked in the photography area of--
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.480]   my understanding is of Apple.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.200]   Or else he's a amateur photography buff.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.040]   I can't remember exactly which one's for the TV.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.400]   I thought he was a QC engineer for the base band, the radio.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   But I don't know.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.400]   That's not clear at all.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.080]   He has some interest in photography.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   So my other theory is that he was out there testing the flash.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.880]   What does it look like for bar photos?
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.880]   That's why I was wondering.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.920]   Did that mean that he had to drink too while testing it?
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.920]   Right.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   It was his birthday.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   Because then you check the focus.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.920]   It was his birthday.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   It was his birthday.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.240]   And the guy who took it that didn't give it to the bartender
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.280]   is the thief here.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.520]   And then what he did it after the whole domino effect after that,
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   it's his fault.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.520]   It's going to be the one that falls.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.640]   Now, here's an interesting little sidebar.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.320]   Steve Wozniak called Wired Episetter blog and said--
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.280]   talked about this a little bit-- and said, by the way,
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.800]   as far as I know, the guy has not been fired.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.240]   I don't think they will fire him.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.640]   Well, then then Steve told an interesting story.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.840]   He said, but at midnight, the day the iPad went on sale,
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.800]   I think Steve was at-- we talked to him.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.600]   I think he was at-- what mall was he at, Dane?
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.100]   He was--
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:13.600]   Valley Fair.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.800]   Valley Fair.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.000]   And there's a picture of Steve holding what is clearly a 3G iPad.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.080]   So it turns out an engineer from Apple--
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   hey, Steve--
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.040]   Thank you.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.440]   He's on delay.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.000]   He just said, Valley Fair.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.680]   Let's all go.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680]   Is that the slogan?
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.720]   No, I don't know.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.760]   I used to hang out there.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.240]   I like Valley Fair.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.200]   Yeah, it's a nice mall.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.360]   There's an Apple store.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.360]   That's Wozniak's Apple store.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.920]   The Palo Alto store is Steve Jobs.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.840]   Anyway, it turned out an engineer who had a 3G iPad.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.240]   And Woz says, I didn't know it was a 3G.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.520]   He showed it to him and talked about it.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.400]   And Woz played with a little bit.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.600]   He was fired.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.640]   Woz says, I feel terrible about this.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.200]   This guy was fired.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.040]   And he said, probably what happens is HR says, look,
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.280]   I know you're showing Woz.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.800]   He actually works for Apple.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.520]   But you violated whatever rule.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.560]   Can't be done in public or whatever.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.560]   And we have to fire everybody who does that.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.160]   So you're fired.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.840]   So they didn't fire--
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.520]   I really shouldn't say his name.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.960]   We should bleep his name out.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.320]   So that--
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.600]   Let's have a little bit of John Smith.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.880]   This poor guy.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.560]   Whenever anybody Googles his name for the rest of his life.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.080]   I know.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.600]   Oh, you're the guy.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.040]   It's like being Monica Lewinsky.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.440]   You just have to change your name, right?
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.920]   I was watching gadgets and games.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.720]   And one of the theories from one of the panelists this week
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.080]   was this is the Fox News Tech show
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.720]   was that it will be John Smith, who we're going to call now,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.840]   who comes out on stage and announces the fourth iPhone.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.240]   I've heard that too.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   That's a great idea.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.440]   And the doors of the flagship store.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.920]   And one more thing.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.560]   Let me introduce John Smith.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.560]   You may remember it from the Broth scholar
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.080]   in beautiful Redwood City.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.720]   That's funny.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.160]   I think that would be a nice thing to do.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.160]   Because everybody feels--
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.080]   He's going to be like that.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.240]   Like when he talks about NBC in the breakup.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.680]   And I think that everybody kind of feels bad for this poor guy.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.480]   I admit it.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.240]   I tweeted his name because when that first Gizmo-no article
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.520]   came out because I felt so bad.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.000]   I said, you do not want to be this guy.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.360]   Then I felt guilty because I did not want to give his name out.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.240]   And I think we won't on this show.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.360]   I feel bad that he's all over the internet now.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.720]   Now you have to give him an iPad.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.040]   Which is more reprehensible.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.440]   Writing a check for $5,000 for an iPhone
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.960]   that you think is probably stolen.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.200]   Because by the way, when they responded to Apple's lawyer,
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.120]   they said, we're so glad to give back this stolen phone.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.080]   A little freaky--
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.160]   A little freaky slip there.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.720]   Or after all of this happens, putting a big ass picture
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.800]   of the guy and his name on the front page of your blog
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.560]   and saying the story.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.400]   What journalistic valla verifu--
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.640]   justification is there for that.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.440]   Oh, there is none.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:44.920]   It's horrible.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.760]   Can't make any.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.640]   OK, OK, OK, OK.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.560]   I'm just going to play devil's advocate here and say,
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   it was the story.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.200]   That is what we know to have happened.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.080]   And people are fascinated by this story
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.280]   because the cult of Apple has made us
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.160]   want to be inside their secret world.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.760]   So while, of course, it's mean and I feel terrible for the guy
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.920]   and selling this device.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.320]   And oh, it's all so icky.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.600]   It makes me want to take a shower.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.360]   And I was involved in it, too, in terms of touching it.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.240]   But it was the news.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.920]   You know, after you touch it, you should always take a shower.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.120]   But you know, I was surprised, Nick Denton and this blog.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.320]   It's like the TMZ of tech blogs.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.200]   So why are we surprised at something like this would go down?
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.920]   This is exactly the way they would--
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.400]   I feel so bad for this guy.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.000]   And his Herbert Gann's kind of--
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.840]   They just wrap it around this.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.880]   --take on it and say that journalism
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.360]   is for finding out things like Woodward and Bernstein.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.760]   But I don't think you can really take this as a sort of Gansian
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.400]   type.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.760]   This is not for posterity.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.000]   The reason, the motivation for publishing this was selfish.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.640]   And it's something that doesn't belong to you.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.040]   It's like page views.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.880]   I mean, it's simple like finders, keepers, luthers,
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.560]   weepers is what the jerk kid does on the playground.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.160]   It's a dirty journalistic move.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   It's a dirty blogger move.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.320]   And it happens.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.960]   And that's a big distinction.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.480]   Is this blogging or is this journalism?
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.160]   Yes.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.560]   And I think that we're talking about blogging here.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.680]   But they would like to say they're journalists.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.640]   Do you think that though?
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.240]   Yes, of course they want to be journalists.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.200]   I would consider us journalists.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.360]   Well, they share our coffee in the press room.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.080]   So they should share our ethics as well.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.320]   But have they-- and I guess that's the bottom line question.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.120]   And that's not fair.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.040]   We're going to move on.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.680]   But have they violated journalistic ethics?
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.880]   Maybe they've committed a crime.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.160]   They're being investigated.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.600]   And I found this.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.960]   We would have had to take it to CBS--
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.520]   or take it to the legal department of our networks.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.800]   And that would have been the end of it.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.920]   We wouldn't have been allowed to do anything else.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.720]   But at the same time, we were happy to discuss it
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.000]   and on our various portals.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.520]   And we got clicks from that as well.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.720]   So the question that I'm struggling with is like, OK,
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   that didn't belong to us.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.560]   Our motivation for talking about it
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.800]   was to continue to be known as the person who
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.640]   knows something about this.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.200]   But then where do we draw the line for this sort of--
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.880]   again, I don't mean to bring up Gens,
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.000]   but Herbert Gens' idea that journalistic ethics is
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.480]   for the betterment of society.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.240]   And it makes us better people.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.520]   Because we can break into these--
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.800]   You do ethics because you do ethics.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.320]   Because it's ethical.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.680]   Not because it's--
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.960]   This is no Watergate.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.000]   It's just the right thing to do, period.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.280]   We would never be able to pay for a story, though.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.200]   But if you think about it, strengthening relationships
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.920]   through taking people up for lunch,
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.680]   or going for coffee with people in order to get stories,
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.680]   isn't that almost like the same thing that we have?
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.560]   I don't do that.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.400]   We pay for photos, quote unquote,
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.160]   photos of people involved in stories.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.120]   So I think the line is blurry all the way around.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.320]   Was it kind of a dick move on Gawker's part?
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.880]   Yeah?
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.480]   Did it make big news?
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.040]   That's what we would expect from--
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.440]   And we all had to cover it then, because at that point,
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.200]   it was news.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.240]   Well, we're stopping.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.320]   We're done covering it.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.400]   Except that I should say one thing, which
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.480]   is the big loser here, Verizon, the droid,
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.520]   Desire, which is about the nice--
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.600]   or I'm sorry, the incredible, which
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.360]   is about the nicest phone I've seen in a long time.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.440]   And an iPhone beater gets no coverage at all,
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.160]   because everybody's talking about the stupid iPhone.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.360]   Have you played any of you played with the incredible yet?
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.360]   No, I haven't.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.160]   I haven't played with it.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.160]   We're here to prove your point.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.440]   We were too busy doing the iPhone story.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.360]   I mean, I use an Nexus 1, which I really like.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.960]   And the incredible is the HTC is kind of like, well,
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.200]   let's give this even better.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.400]   And Verizon's got it, and it's going to be out the seat.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.200]   Why do you like it more than the Nexus 1?
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.560]   8 megapixel camera.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.960]   It's got the same AMOLED screen, which I love on the Nexus 1.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.760]   It's using the HTC Sense UI on top of Android 2.1.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.920]   So it's got all the features of Android 2.1.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.320]   It really looks like a phone, the kind of phone
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.360]   that would have gotten a lot of coverage in any other world.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.800]   But Apple's.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.200]   And Apple owns this boy.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.960]   I tell you, they're very good at this.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.080]   Even in this case, yes, there was some damage to Apple
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.920]   because perhaps people aren't buying iPhones
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.200]   till they find out everybody knows it comes out in June anyway.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.520]   I don't think that changes anything.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.320]   But they sure were able to bury the story about a big competitor.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.400]   Not to mention the the kin, the windows, kin.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.800]   That always also brings up the fact that there, even though this
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.480]   might be a story we're talking about later on,
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.760]   but that they might acquire ARM, so they're
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.240]   going to just distract every single other phone out there.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.360]   Yeah, that's an interesting rumor.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.040]   ARM makes, of course, chips for a lot of phones.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.480]   And the ARM architecture is what the iPad A4 is based on.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.520]   Of course, the iPhone uses an ARM chip.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.680]   Apple has enough cash.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.880]   They've got 32 billion in the bank.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.120]   It would only be 20% of their money to buy ARM.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.280]   And then, does that go against antitrust laws?
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.560]   Well, it has to be--
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.800]   I presume it would have to be improved.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.560]   Well, especially is an ARM UK based.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.360]   So they would have a ton of EU involvement, which does not--
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:54.860]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.520]   They seem to be a little bit more stringent in terms
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.080]   of the law relations.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   EU hates corporations.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:37:59.720]   They hate them.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.720]   They hate companies.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.280]   It's so funny.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.760]   Somebody was saying, I can't remember.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.560]   Was this on Twig?
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.680]   Somebody said, it's so strange, because the Europeans who
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.840]   have had crappy governments for generations trust government
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.480]   and hate corporations in the United States,
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.760]   where we've had a great government,
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.200]   but sketch corporations for generations.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.440]   We love corporations.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.240]   We hate government.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.240]   What does that say?
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.880]   What does that say about either of us?
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.240]   I really like this incredible.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.120]   I think it's a great phone.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.720]   I think the Dell phone, which also leaked out this week,
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.480]   another Windows-- and the new Windows mobile platform.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   Very interesting phone.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.360]   I got to pitch that as a segment as like, OK,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.560]   forget the iPhone.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.920]   And let's just look at the other great phones that
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.560]   are out there, especially because people do have that AT&T
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:39.800]   thing.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.360]   I'm writing that down right now.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.960]   iPhone alternatives.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.760]   That needs to be done.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.440]   It's a good story.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.040]   That's good.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.160]   What about Palm going away?
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:48.680]   That's sad.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.960]   The latest thing is that HTC, which was one of a couple of companies
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.560]   left that might consider buying them,
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.920]   apparently has declined to.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.840]   I thought they might for the patents,
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.920]   just to help them in their fight against Apple.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:59.360]   Right.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.240]   That's what I think the buzz was, or that even Apple might
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.320]   consider that.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:03.840]   Right.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.440]   But it appeared--
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:04.440]   No.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.560]   Nobody wants it.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.480]   Once you look under the hood, it's not that attractive.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.840]   It's sad.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.960]   It is.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.880]   I'm nostalgic for my trios already.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.880]   I have had almost every Palm right up to the--
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.000]   was it the life drive?
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.880]   The one with a little 5 megabyte drive in it?
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.000]   It feels sad about that.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.520]   But you know what?
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.040]   This is the juggernaut that is the iPhone.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.080]   And it marches on.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:30.960]   Did you see?
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.640]   Go ahead.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.200]   Can we talk Blippi?
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.080]   Yeah, not yet.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.560]   But we will get to Blippi.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.240]   I want to do one more iPhone story.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.560]   And this is because I have three women here.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.760]   Are women more likely to give their number to a man
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.000]   with an iPhone?
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.880]   That was the most ridiculous story I heard this week.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.240]   That's pretty funny.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:53.280]   I mean, I could see how it's a sexy, hot, you know, accessory
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:53.800]   and phone.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.440]   I think the iPhone is a hot thing.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:55.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.400]   I didn't realize.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.360]   I'm going to get rid of this Nexus 1.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.680]   OK.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   Really?
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.160]   Really?
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.320]   The iPhone is hot?
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.760]   And you know, maybe it reflects a certain socioeconomic status.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.880]   You're rich.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.400]   And you showed to know that that means you're rich,
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.760]   or it just means you're an oxidation star.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.000]   Yeah, apps are a conversation.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.920]   So you go, hey, check out my-- this app.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.360]   Isn't this funny?
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.160]   Like, what?
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:18.640]   I don't know.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.840]   And then maybe that creates a conversation, which then
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.640]   leads to--
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.600]   Yeah, look.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.840]   I got texts from last night.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.160]   I don't know.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.520]   What does that say about the iPad?
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.120]   Will the iPad make your friends?
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:30.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.000]   Total tip magnet.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:32.920]   It's really?
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.440]   I don't know.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440]   No.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.040]   In the live.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.840]   But I am the coolest person on the subway when you get on--
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.240]   Do people--
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.320]   When you're reading an iPad on the subway.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.760]   And then I see someone else with it.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.960]   And I'm like, I want to be the only one.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.600]   I actually actively-- I don't want people to bug me,
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.520]   so I kind of hide it.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.000]   And I pretend I'm not--
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.360]   I really-- no, I don't have an iPad now.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.160]   Go away.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:52.640]   Really?
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.680]   Yeah, I don't want the attention.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   You just want to keep all 10 of your fingers.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.200]   I just keep on playing a God's finger, and we rule.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.640]   Doesn't there sound like I lost a part of his finger?
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.040]   Because somebody ripped the iPad.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:03.520]   Yes.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.560]   The tip of his pinky.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.200]   It was-- he had an apple bag.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.320]   And the apple bag apparently cinches around your finger,
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.400]   if somebody steals it.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.680]   The small price to pay, though, considering that people got
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.560]   killed for the PlayStation 3 when it came out.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   Good point.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.080]   Good point.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.280]   So I'd rather lose a pinky than my life.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:19.880]   Say it again.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.800]   I'm in a guy that did cargo pants for his iPad.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.680]   He made custom cargo pants.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.440]   Yeah, that's hot.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.440]   I suppose.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.520]   That's hot.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:32.160]   He's got like a big thing on his thigh.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.480]   I don't know.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.400]   I don't think so.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:34.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.080]   There's a joke there that even I will decline to fall.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:37.880]   Yes, me either.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.600]   Not even going to be bad.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.000]   If your dad or her Becky, I know you go for it.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.500]   I won't.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:42.360]   Is that my pad and your pants?
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:42.860]   It's funny.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.360]   What is this?
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.720]   Because Becky brings your dad and Natalie, you bring your mom.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.320]   What is this?
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.760]   Is this-- are you afraid of me?
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.120]   Is that--
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.880]   Family show.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.840]   Oh, it's a family show.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.560]   I brought two and a half generations.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.960]   You did.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.400]   So Blippi.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.320]   I like Blippi.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.000]   Do you use Blippi's share?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.880]   I don't use Blippi.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.080]   I don't care to share what I'm buying with people, really.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:02.640]   That much.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.800]   I just tweet it.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.520]   If I'm buying something and I want to share it,
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.440]   I just tweet it.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.320]   I think the advantage of Blippi is it's kind of automatic.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.240]   You hook up your Amazon or your iTunes.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   You could hook up a credit card to it.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.840]   And it's kind of like it automatically
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.480]   tweets your purchases.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.560]   You know who started this?
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.040]   Well, a number of people.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.640]   But Philip Kaplan-Pudd, the guy who did the F2 Company,
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.120]   is one of their kind of advisors.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   He came in early on on this.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.680]   I signed up for it just to watch other people.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.560]   And I thought it interesting what people were renting on Netflix
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.840]   and the iTunes aspect.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.200]   But tying it to your credit card and having all of your purchases
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:45.960]   made public, that is so ridiculous and creepy and oversharing.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.400]   And it really bugs me at every level as a consumer
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   and as a consumer reporter.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.200]   Well, I guess I'm just going to stop doing that.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.520]   Well, then it also lets-- I can see
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.760]   what people would want to share so that if their friends are
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.840]   buying presents for them, they could get a sense of the things
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.120]   they've already been buying.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.720]   I think it's fascinating to see what people are buying.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.640]   Now, the iTunes thing is great because you see what music
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.400]   and apps they're buying.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.280]   That's neat.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.160]   You also feel like for a personality, like I saw,
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.640]   I just need to just go there.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.880]   She talks about what she's buying,
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.480]   but could that be a sponsorship deal also?
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.600]   Well, it's certainly a way for Blippi to make some.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.200]   I think that's probably what they were hoping
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.400]   that there would be something along the lines there.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.960]   But if you're really, really judicious about the people
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.640]   that you accept within that network,
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.080]   then it has maybe some use value when you're
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.840]   looking for specific types of things.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.720]   So you can see what movies I'm watching.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.520]   You could see what--
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.280]   I'm sorry, Natalie Del Conte is the nicest person.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.240]   And her purchases must be so upstanding.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.440]   And I just have not that nice or--
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.520]   Let me just put this one out.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.280]   You don't have to put--
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.280]   Y'all don't know what I'm buying.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.680]   You don't have to put everything on there.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.960]   You have control over that.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.400]   I only have one credit card on there.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.280]   You can say, review what the things are and not
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.240]   an unchecked psalm if you--
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.080]   You know, you've got a Swedish penis pub.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.120]   You could say it's not mine, that kind of thing.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:01.600]   Oh, God.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.480]   I get worried about these automatic alerts.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.760]   I'm starting to do them for everything,
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.040]   every program that I use.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.920]   And then sometimes you're like, I don't want really
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.160]   that automatic alert, but you're not in your computer,
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.080]   you can't get it.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   I'm going to defend it because I just think it's kind of--
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.280]   OK, so here I bought Kick-Ass the comic, right?
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.720]   And we get these comments and people could talk about it.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.400]   And I think this is kind of neat.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.360]   I just-- I think there's some value
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.640]   into seeing what people are buying as a recommendation
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.320]   service.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.000]   And I think that the comments are kind of a great way to--
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.520]   It's a conversation starter.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.080]   You know, I'm starting to research gear that goes along
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.280]   with procreation.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.760]   And I don't understand how people choose strollers.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.760]   And--
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.960]   So that would be a good example.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:43.720]   And that kind of thing.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.320]   And I go to Amazon and the top-rated stuff.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.800]   And I don't know if this crazy person thinks
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.640]   this stroller is great.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.520]   Like, I don't know anything about this.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:53.800]   That's--
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.440]   Just call me.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.240]   That's what you do.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:56.960]   That's what you do.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.960]   You call another mom.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.680]   So I would appreciate something where, like, if I did buy
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.520]   this one stroller and people would be like,
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.240]   it'll cut your baby's fingers off.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:03.960]   Then you know--
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.000]   You know what's funny is that-- because our kids are 18 and 15
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:07.760]   now.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.440]   I know all about strollers from the '90s.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.880]   Oh, yeah?
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.640]   But it changes.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.320]   That's great, basically.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.360]   It changes.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:14.840]   It's like--
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.040]   And you're doing that McLaren rocks.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:16.600]   Exactly.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.280]   By his-- we had a McLaren.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.520]   What is that?
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.760]   Do they still have McLarens?
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.680]   Yeah, they have McLarens.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.160]   They're OK.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.480]   They're like the station wagon.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.200]   They're solid.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.040]   That's what we had as a McLaren.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:27.880]   We've evolved.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.920]   But you don't use a pre-ka.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.880]   Those are kind of no.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.160]   Those are junky.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.640]   No, what do you like?
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.560]   The Sydney Mini.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.400]   Sydney Mini.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   It's the best.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.120]   It is the best.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.760]   And I hooked you up with some serious arithmetic.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.480]   I'm sorry to turn this into baby talk.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.640]   You guys, I really don't need to do this.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.600]   But I just asked--
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.400]   Cheers crossing your legs right now.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.360]   I'm saying that this is a too-to-do.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.240]   No, I don't know.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.800]   I'm just observing.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.160]   I don't know if I'm going to--
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.960]   Shall we back into the Blippi credit card exposure?
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.560]   Well, that's why Blippi's in the news.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.160]   And somebody told me one of them was mine,
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.640]   but I don't think that's the case.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.520]   It wasn't.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.960]   So what happened with Blippi is they strip out--
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.120]   they take the raw feed from your credit card.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.480]   They are using the same service that Mint uses, which
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.440]   is the same service that a lot of banks use.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:10.960]   What is it?
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.680]   I can't remember what the name of it is.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.960]   Some silly web 2.0, whoopee boopee, doopee name.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.080]   But all the banks use it.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.720]   So you're not giving your credit card information
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.960]   to Blippi per se.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.000]   You're giving it to this third party that banks
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:24.720]   and Mint use.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.120]   So it's not like you're revealing anything.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.040]   But the information Blippi was getting back.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.840]   It included credit card numbers and a lot of other raw information.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.920]   Their automatic systems strips it out,
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.360]   and then posts this kind of boundalized version
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.520]   of what you bought.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:45.240]   But apparently, Google was caching full information.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.080]   And if you did a Google search for Blippi,
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.520]   you could get these credit card numbers.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.920]   But it was only four numbers, right?
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.760]   Becky, is that right?
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.120]   It was five, they say.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.680]   And I went through all 18 pages, because we
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.400]   were going to do it for GMA.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.920]   And so I started going through all 18 pages.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.240]   And also noticed it was the same four.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.800]   And then one number was on a later page.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.560]   And so--
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.720]   And they were early adopters.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.160]   This was from beta.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.800]   But I was part of the beta.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.840]   So it made me a little nervous.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.480]   I came really close to killing my Blippi account.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.400]   And I think I may still--
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.360]   Did it make you nervous?
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.280]   That puts things into question when
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.760]   information like that is released, definitely.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.880]   Yeah, that's a pretty big leak.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:30.480]   Yeah, I called PUD on Friday because I
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.760]   wanted comment from then if we were
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.560]   going to run it on Saturday morning.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.640]   And by the time he returned my call,
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.080]   the information come out that it wasn't all users' credit
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.640]   cards released.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.080]   It was a pretty minor.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.480]   It was a pretty minor.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.240]   He was doing a lot of damage control.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.360]   And at that point, when I said, OK, if it's only four or five
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.680]   people, then we're not going to do the story.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.360]   And I could hear this feeling of visible exhale
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.120]   of just this incredible relief.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.280]   And he said, my day, which already sucks,
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.040]   just got less worse.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.680]   Well, it could be a death blow.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.760]   I mean, this is a startup.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.680]   And that could be the death blow.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.800]   The truth is, while I thought it was a really good idea,
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.720]   no, everybody has the same reaction you all did,
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.760]   which is, I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.000]   So I think it's dead anyway.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.720]   But it's going to be something like that.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.480]   But we don't really have--
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.920]   It creates a huge privacy backlash from the general public.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.840]   Right.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.040]   It's funny, though, that we keep trying to figure out
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.200]   the best form of recommending products
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.640]   to our friends and family.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.760]   And really, no one's been successful at it yet.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.080]   OK, Amazon's pretty good.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.080]   Well, you know what?
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.600]   Facebook, that's the next subject.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.000]   Next subject is Facebook.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.480]   And we're going to get to that in just a second.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.880]   We are going to take a commercial break.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.120]   I just did want to point out one thing.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.600]   As long as it's talking about e-commerce,
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.800]   Amazon seems to have thrown in the towel
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.760]   because they were fighting the iPad tooth and nail.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.200]   Right on the front page now, free Kindle for iPad.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.600]   No longer is there a Kindle ad on the front page of Amazon.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.000]   There's an ad for their iPad ad.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.040]   I think they forgot that they make hardware.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.000]   I think they suddenly realized, I bet you the stats came in
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.320]   and they realized even now, one week in,
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.920]   more Kindle books are being read and sold on the iPad
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.760]   than we're ever sold on the Kindle.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.880]   That's how I read my books now.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.240]   I mean, I'm glad there's a Kindle app
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.240]   because I can read all the Kindle books I've ever bought.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.280]   I can still buy books.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.880]   Amazon still gets the money.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.040]   They just don't sell a Kindle.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.120]   What's the big deal?
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.640]   I think it's very interesting that they've kind of changed
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.280]   their front page.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.200]   And they say, yeah, yeah, you might want to get Kindle for iPad.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.560]   Not a fight worth fighting.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.400]   Right.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.480]   They shouldn't get in the hardware game.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:26.920]   Who cares?
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:27.960]   But I'll have that.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.080]   Right.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:29.960]   All right, we want to take a break.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.000]   Come on back in a little bit with our great guest, Natalie Del Conte
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.440]   from Buzz Out Loud on CNET and CBS, of course,
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.920]   from CBS Digital, her digital goddess, Shira Lazar.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.040]   Great to have you.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.480]   And from ABC and Good Morning America,
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.000]   my old friend from Tech TV, Becky Worley, who is @Borley
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:49.360]   on Twitter.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.920]   Right.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.880]   @Borley.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.120]   I'll get all of there.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.720]   But you're Natalie Del Conte on Twitter.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.560]   All one word.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.640]   All one word.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.520]   And Shira, you're Shira on Twitter?
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.000]   What is your--
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.920]   @Shira Lazar.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.760]   Shira Lazar, the full name.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.440]   Yes, my full name.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.560]   I should see you because @Shira, like,
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.800]   you should take it like Madonna.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.920]   Yeah, I mean, how many Shira's are there in the world?
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.320]   You probably could.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.720]   It might be too late now.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.440]   Is Shira-- there's a Shira.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.760]   She has-- she's a blogger freelance writer.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.760]   Damn.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.000]   Oh, she's been showing up.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Sorry, I'm a bit up.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.960]   I did there.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.080]   You know, there is a Leo.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.080]   And he's got five friends.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.840]   He's only had five friends for three years.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.040]   He's got a block--
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.800]   Are you one of them?
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.760]   No, because his feet is blocked.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.600]   But there's a new service, which I signed up for,
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.520]   that notifies you because apparently Twitter's killing
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.360]   old accounts that haven't been much used.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.800]   And there's a service that'll notify you
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.320]   when it becomes free, so I'm hoping I can get Leo.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:44.920]   Oh, what's that mean?
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.040]   We're all going to spam him.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.640]   I'll have to find it because you might want to reserve Shira.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.720]   Yeah, I would love to.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.960]   You should stay that site.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.480]   I'll find it.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   I don't remember what it is.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.080]   And if I-- when I can find it, I will.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.200]   Maybe somebody in the chat room.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.760]   Chat room will tell me because that's probably
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.000]   how I found out about the first place.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.400]   The chat room is my brain.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.240]   I do want to tell you about Carbonite Pro.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.240]   Carbonite is a longtime sponsor.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.120]   It's a great backup solution for end users.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.000]   Carbonite Pro is their new solution for business.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.160]   It turned out when Carbonite started talking to users,
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.800]   they found out a lot of their users were businesses.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.840]   We're using the consumer version of Carbonite
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.320]   because it was so simple, so easy.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.200]   It worked so well.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.240]   Carbonite, you go and you install it on your system
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.000]   and immediately starts backing up those individual personal
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.040]   files like photos, documents, emails, financial documents,
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:32.520]   encrypted with AES-256 bit encryption to the cloud using SSL
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.480]   so it's absolutely secure and safe.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.160]   And then anytime you need to restore,
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.240]   you can restore on any system.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.920]   Just log into Carbonite in your account and get it back.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.640]   So Carbonite said, well, wait a minute.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.040]   Maybe we should do a business version.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   And now they have Carbonite Pro.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.400]   Carbonite Pro is fantastic.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.560]   It allows you to--
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.760]   Twitter claims, thank you.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:57.560]   It allows you to back up all the desks in your office
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.480]   with one account, one dashboard.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.320]   You know which ones are backed up, which ones aren't.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.720]   I like this.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.960]   If you've ever worked in an office and you've accidentally
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.320]   deleted a file and you know you have to make the perp walk
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.940]   down the hall to the IT department,
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.200]   beg them to restore the--
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.200]   So this way, you can let your users restore their own files.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.760]   You don't have to, but you can.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.280]   Every employee has access if you want.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.640]   You will be notified.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   Your office will be up and running again with no headaches,
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.240]   no time lost.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.600]   Look, this is a solution that's been around for some time now.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.680]   It's really polished, really great.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.880]   Carbonite Pro.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.800]   Prices start as low as $10 a month.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.960]   I'll give you an example.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.560]   Eight computers, five gigs back up, $25 a month.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.000]   It's really affordable.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.560]   CarbonitePro.com, please go there and take a look.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.720]   It is a great solution.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.400]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.000]   Carbonite Pro for small business.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.480]   We'll do it for you.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.920]   So twitterclaims.com is how I was able to say,
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.960]   I want Leo and she should do that with Shira.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:55.000]   I wonder if there will be some kind of redirect
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.280]   where you can have more than one Twitter ID.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.760]   Because when you get the URL for, say, Leo, LaPorte and Twitt
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.640]   and all of that stuff, it may be interesting to be able to have
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.880]   more than one, so that is your complete holistic brand.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.680]   Do you guys use something like HootSuite or something
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.160]   to manage like multiple accounts and things like that
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.320]   or tweet deck?
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.720]   I mean, how do you do it, Natalie?
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.840]   Yeah, I use Tweety on mobile and I use tweet deck.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.360]   Well, the official Twitter application.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.200]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.280]   I just not called that anymore.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.080]   Well, yeah, it's the Twitter application.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.800]   They're moving it, yeah.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.760]   And I use tweet deck because I have a couple of accounts as well.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.680]   Becky, do you have multiple, do you have multiple Twitter's?
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.160]   I use Twitter later for some things just because I kind of
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.080]   started on that and then I use tweet deck, so.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.320]   You know.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.120]   The Big Facebook Developers Conference, F8 happened today.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.120]   Mark Zuckerberg spoke on Wednesday.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.240]   I've been calling it F8.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:46.800]   F8?
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.120]   I wonder, yeah, that must be what they're thinking, right?
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:49.560]   Maybe.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.440]   I don't feel like there's a true count when you really
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.600]   have a question to your point.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:54.400]   It's a license plate.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.440]   That's right.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.200]   But it is F8 because basically it's Facebook's world.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.720]   We just live in it.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.200]   It would appear to be so.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.760]   I feel like what they did was a big grab for the internet.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.520]   They basically said, don't use the internet.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.160]   Use Facebook.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.080]   And use Facebook behaviors when you're not on Facebook.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.080]   Everywhere else.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.080]   Right.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.080]   So Facebook washing, they're saying it like a brain washing.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.080]   Facebook.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:21.560]   And when Mark Zuckerberg says open, he's not really saying the
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.080]   open net.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   He's saying open as long as it's going all going to us.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.200]   So and you know, I don't think that regular users will get this,
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.800]   but it's because it seems very nice and simple.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   Well, they're going to put a like button on websites.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.680]   Anybody can run the Facebook like button on their website.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.320]   And when you press like, if you're logged into Facebook, it'll
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.880]   automatically go to your news feed with it and who wouldn't
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.280]   want a little plug on the news feed.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.640]   And then you can aggregate the likes.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.840]   You can aggregate the comments back on the original site.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.280]   What's wrong with that?
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.280]   Well control.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:55.920]   I feel like did everyone I think should read Molly's rant blog from this
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:01.480]   week because she talks a lot about how it's opt out, which is intrusive.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.160]   So everything that you want to like around the web then becomes public, unless you do
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.480]   a lot of work actually to make that not the case.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.600]   So that in and of itself is offensive.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:18.000]   It's also exactly what Google was trying to do with Google friend connect, but they haven't
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   really been successful.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   But Google friend connect is opt in.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.920]   You have to log in and say, I want to be part of this.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.760]   But that's what Google wanted to do.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:31.800]   They just haven't been as successful at creating that behavior because Google friend connect
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:38.120]   wanted it to be that every website all over the place had a Google login, a Google chat,
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.760]   any kind of Google buzz, they haven't been able to do that yet.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:44.640]   It'll be interesting to see if they can do it with buzz and make that more ubiquitous,
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.720]   but they haven't been able to.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:50.120]   But because we spend so much time in the Facebook ecosystem, we know those behaviors.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.120]   We know to like something, to comment on something.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.880]   So that's something that can extend outside of the ecosystem of Facebook.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:00.800]   But ultimately everything comes back to Facebook so that Facebook gathers information about
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.080]   you where you visit, what you're doing, all the sites you visit and then sells it.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.040]   So their way of tracking more and more of what we're doing and having control of our
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:13.760]   actions and keeping us in the Facebook ecosphere and ecosystem.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.760]   But you know what, Google, the reason why I think that didn't work is because people
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:21.000]   look at Google still as search, whereas Facebook will always look at it as our social platform,
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.320]   the way we connect with each other.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:29.480]   So just adding these layers that make sense in a way, which makes it an easier extension
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   of what we're doing, even though that's more of their way of patrolling us.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:38.640]   >> Do you think, Leo, and Sharon Natalie, tell me what you think.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:45.240]   Do you think that for people who are overwhelmed by the internet, do you think that if Facebook's
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:52.400]   plan proceeds as they envision it, that it would create almost like a gated safe, this
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.000]   is the part of the internet that makes sense for the people who are sort of overwhelmed
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.240]   by the scary internet?
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.000]   Is there any upside of it in that direction?
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.880]   >> Yeah, in the same way that AOL made people feel safe.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.560]   That was their first interaction with the internet.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.440]   And this is exactly what Facebook's trying to create.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.440]   Is it an AOL-styled Facebook internet?
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.240]   >> Where they're not responsible for the content.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.760]   >> Right, even better.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.560]   >> Do you think on the other hand, people might rebel and say, you know what, I don't
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.200]   feel like logging into Facebook.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.160]   I just want to navigate things on my own.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:26.000]   I don't want anyone telling me that I need to be logged into anywhere.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.600]   Will people go the other direction at a certain point?
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.120]   Do you feel that control?
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.120]   >> I think those people are few and far between.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.800]   Most people will just kind of follow the mob.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:39.960]   >> I could tell you right now, the conversation we're having is being held only by a few geeks
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.360]   who even understand what all of this means.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.600]   The normal world is just saying, oh, that's cool, like button, big deal.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.960]   >> This is exactly like David Polk's review of the iPad.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.200]   You know, geeks won't like the fact that you can't control it.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.640]   They'll love a lot of the hardware, but they won't like the lack of control.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.640]   And the gen pop will think, oh, that's just cool.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:03.920]   And they're given everything they need to deal with without the headaches of customization
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.360]   and control.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:13.520]   >> So there are 400 million people who use Facebook of that, 399,990,000 will say, yeah,
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:20.440]   and 10,000 will go, oh, unfortunately, where the people listen to show are in that group.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.440]   You know, I know that.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.080]   >> Yeah, I think the parts that you like, I mean, I went to Yelp to test it out.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:30.520]   And I loved the fact that I could see what my Facebook friends had reviewed.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:35.280]   And that was just another layer of exactly what Zuckerberg was talking about in terms
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:42.200]   of having the web mitigated by people you trust in a more passive way for me, the user.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.400]   Now, I'm sort of playing devil's advocate.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.680]   >> No, everybody wants that.
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:47.920]   This is the difference.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:51.520]   What we don't want is for one company to own that and if we're to only come from one
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.520]   company.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.840]   So I would like my Facebook friends, my Twitter friends, my Google friends, my anybody else
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.200]   friends, I'd like to know that.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.880]   I don't want it to just be Facebook and I don't want Facebook to own and control all
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:03.320]   that content.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:09.120]   So absolutely what they're providing is a value, but it's a value primarily to Facebook
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.560]   because it is about the Facebook world.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.320]   >> And we saw from that read, write, read, debacle a couple of months ago that most people
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:20.880]   go to not most, but a lot of people still go to Google, type in Facebook and find Facebook
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.360]   that way instead of just putting Facebook in the URL.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:29.480]   So that shows that a lot of people are very far removed from the actual process and that
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:35.040]   Stana Boyd's whole point is that defaults matter and the fact that this is on by default
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:38.320]   is what's most offensive about it.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:43.880]   And if you could control it a little bit more, had more autonomy than I wouldn't be so scared
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.880]   of it.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.800]   >> So your complaint is that Facebook is the opiate of the masses?
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.800]   >> Yes.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.800]   >> I'm not sure if I made that.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:51.800]   >> I like that.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   >> I like that.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   >> Very Marxist.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.600]   >> That's a great quote.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:03.200]   >> But as a consumer reporter and someone who has to think about what's the easiest for
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:09.720]   people who just don't want the level of interaction with their, with the web that we take because
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.920]   we're geeks, I can see the benefit.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.760]   >> Yeah, and then again, that's happened.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.760]   >> So I don't know.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:21.360]   >> But I agree with you, the internet for many normal users, the masses is overwhelming.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:26.400]   So if your friends can curate that for you and then also Facebook will recommend things
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.840]   knowing that the other news you're looking at, they'll recommend other stories for you.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:37.440]   So for the masses, the regular users, that could be something that makes things easier.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.600]   >> It is.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.920]   And it's the, it's okay.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.920]   So-
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.760]   >> But we're assuming that a lot of people have digital discretion, which they don't.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.760]   I don't think-
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.560]   >> People are aware enough to exercise it.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.560]   >> Right.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.200]   >> They're just going to take that of, as you said, the default.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.920]   The problem is that there, look, the social graph, this is the term that people use to
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:02.560]   describe the map of you and your interconnections in the world is your social graph.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.400]   The social graph is very valuable.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.480]   Being able to walk by a restaurant and find out what your friends think of that restaurant
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.720]   is hugely valuable.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.120]   What is dangerous is for any one company to be the collector and arbiter of that.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:23.080]   And that's what Facebook, with its 400 million users, is uniquely positioned to do.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:28.160]   They may even already, it may, the war may be over because they have such dominance that
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.160]   every year is-
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160]   >> And I tend to-
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.160]   >> We think- >> We think-
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.760]   >> I'm going to get a little bit esoteric here, but I tend to think that I was talking
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:40.640]   about earlier how there really is no one website that recommends everything that we want.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:46.880]   Because we are right now culturally developing a learned behavior which David Levy, who is
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.280]   a professor out of the University of Washington, calls information environmentalism.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.000]   We're learning how to filter out what's pertinent to us versus what's not pertinent to us.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.480]   I don't think there's a technology that's going to do that for us, but I think that Facebook
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.880]   thinks that it is going to be that technology.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.080]   And that's where I find that a little bit dangerous.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.080]   >> Absolutely.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.280]   >> Damn, Natalie, that pregnancy has got something going on.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.520]   >> All I do is miss and read.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.320]   I stay home and knit and read, that's all I do.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.320]   >> No, it's a- >> I don't get how much.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.800]   >> It's a very good point.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.040]   And so when you go searching for a stroller, it's only a matter of time before you just
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040]   go out.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   >> And search for stroller.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040]   >> I'll look for my- >> No, I have the gift thing.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.240]   They'll add, I mean, right now there's causes where you can donate through the site through
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.240]   Facebook.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.680]   It will only be a matter of time where you're going to be able to buy products, see what
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680]   your friends have bought with it.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   >> This is the dream.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.240]   >> Through a status update, and then click it and within Facebook you can buy it.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.240]   >> And this is Mark Zuckerberg's exact dream.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.200]   He says, the next time Natalie wants a stroller, she should just log into her Facebook page
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.120]   and not only will we already know and have an ad for a stroller, but we'll also aggregate
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.720]   all of your friends' decisions.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.360]   You won't even have to ask.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   We'll just know.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.240]   >> Right, so where's the agency in that?
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.120]   Where- then I don't become smarter.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.680]   I don't become- >> No, but-
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.680]   >> But Facebook becomes richer.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.680]   >> Facebook becomes richer.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.680]   >> That's a great point though.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:08.080]   >> According to Tamara- >> One of the times, first Becky and then Shura, go ahead Becky.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.520]   >> I think that's the point though, is that we're just all too busy to be active advocates
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.720]   in all of this.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.880]   We just need a little bit more, a cleaner feed coming at us that's more relevant information.
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.400]   The overload right now is too much for most people.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   I mean, the amount of information I'm consuming today versus what I consumed three years ago,
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   five years ago, off the charts.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.600]   I'm looking for that stream to get narrower.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.600]   >> Sure.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   >> Go ahead.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.840]   >> I was just gonna say that's what technology does, make things simpler.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.600]   And not that that's sometimes better for us because it makes us simpler beings in terms
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.800]   of the way we consume things, but that's just devolution.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.640]   >> But that's the danger.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.960]   And this is why I really worry is because while a few of us know and care about the fact
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.320]   that it should be open and should be a large number of companies involved in this, Facebook's
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:01.440]   gonna make it so easy, so convenient, so automatic for 400 million people that it might even
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.840]   be the battle is over.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   >> But now we're moralizing what is better in terms of how we control information or
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.480]   if whether or not it's controlled for us.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.880]   >> Well, no, that's not moralizing to say that no one company should control this information.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.880]   That's not moralizing.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.280]   That's absolute truth.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.240]   You think one company should be in charge of that?
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.240]   >> No, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.320]   I mean, we're moralizing how much we should be in charge of our own information and we're
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.120]   moralizing how much we should be involved in the process of the country.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.120]   >> Well, we know what's best for those people.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.120]   >> Well, you and I do.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.120]   >> Yes.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.120]   >> I would agree with that.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.440]   >> You know what's best for you?
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.440]   >> Yes.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.040]   >> And you should listen to us and you shouldn't become Facebook horse, but.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.760]   >> Well, I think that it's best not to become, you know, the bewildered herd is what Noam
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.320]   Chomsky calls them, so.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.320]   >> Damn, she did it again.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.760]   >> God, my God, who's the man?
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   >> Oh, man.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   I am feeling so dumb right now.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.760]   >> I'm gonna stop now.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.360]   >> No, that's great, Natalie.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.600]   I'm impressed.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.600]   It's wonderful.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.840]   >> Well, so who would be a competitor to the service?
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.160]   Do you think that this is, I mean, how does this differ?
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.880]   Would Dig be able to compete?
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.880]   I don't know who.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880]   >> No, no.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.880]   >> Google.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.680]   >> No, well, Dig is, the question is, is Dig still alive?
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.960]   Not is this gonna kill Dig?
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.480]   Is Dig still alive?
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.840]   I think Google is the only credible company that could fight this and Google's trying
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.120]   to do the same thing, but do it with open standards and do it.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:28.680]   I believe in a more collegial way.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:34.800]   I think Facebook really is, this is Facebook really saying we want it all.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800]   We want to own it.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   >> And imagine, so great.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:42.880]   >> And do Google SEO, so we are creating stuff around Google search, but this definitely
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.960]   closes the game of that.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.960]   >> Yeah, and you can do this when you have this much power.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.560]   Fred Wilson talks about this.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:56.360]   He's the venture capitalist and blogger who writes at AVC.com.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:02.160]   He says clearly Facebook is executing fast and well at a scale few internet companies
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.160]   have ever reached.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:11.880]   It's very impressive to watch, but he's talking about his colleague who wrote a blog post who
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.400]   says Albert, who says, "I see at least one flaw with his plan for domination.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.480]   I simply don't believe that there is a single social graph that makes sense.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.360]   I may very well follow someone's bookmarks on delicious that I don't want to have any
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.280]   other relationship with or take the group of people I feel comfortable sharing my four
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.320]   square check-ins with.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.360]   These are all people's I trust and would enjoy if they showed up right there.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:36.160]   And then that group in turn is different from the people I work with on Google Docs or Microsoft
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.240]   Docs connected to Facebook, trying to shoehorn all of these into a single graph is unlikely
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.880]   to work well.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.440]   Fred says, "I'm with Albert on this issue.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.280]   I don't think it'll happen, but we are, and we are putting our money as a venture firm
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.560]   where our mouths are by backing companies like Twitter, Tumblr, Four Square, Discus,
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.920]   Jet Glue, and others that are building different social graphs."
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.760]   So maybe the fact is there isn't one social graph to rule them all.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.560]   We don't have to worry about it because Facebook couldn't serve everybody.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:06.080]   Facebook's where, I mean, isn't it true that your Facebook friends are different from your
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.080]   Twitter friends?
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.480]   That's a different graph, isn't it?
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.920]   Well, they're not mutually exclusive, that's for sure.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   They overlap.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   They overlap.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   They're a vind diagram.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.920]   But they aren't different.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.560]   Because for Facebook, you need to follow each other to be part of the piece.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.160]   But I, for instance, maybe all of you are Facebook friends of mine because I consider
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.520]   you friends in real life, but I may also follow people on Twitter that I wouldn't necessarily
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:33.720]   consider friends or I wouldn't ask for a baby stroller recommendations from or I wouldn't
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.680]   necessarily want food recommendations from.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.680]   So it's...
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.880]   I think it'll become a much clearer line that Facebook is for friends and frolics, and
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.120]   then Twitter is only for more professional or public.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.120]   It's for news.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.120]   So they'll both coexist.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.120]   Mm-hmm.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.960]   I don't think it's a competition anymore.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   I think Facebook last year was really looking at Twitter as a huge competitor, and I always
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.400]   thought that was the wrong thing.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400]   And it's...
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400]   And it's...
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.400]   What?
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.480]   I think they've left Twitter in the dust, don't you?
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480]   Facebook has?
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:14.640]   Well, no, Twitter still has its functionality completely, I look at it as a different use.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:18.800]   Do you pipe your tweets into your Facebook page?
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.800]   I do.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.800]   I connect the two.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.800]   And then I have my Facebook fan page.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.800]   Don't we all?
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.800]   My regular Facebook.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.800]   My Facebook has a consumer's thoughts.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:33.480]   I think that most users, especially of the geeky crowd, they know to separate.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.040]   And I want to hear about Tom and Eileen's vacation in Hawaii on Facebook, and I want
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:42.000]   to hear about Tom's streaming of whatever show he's doing.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   Too much work.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.560]   Yeah, I like the newsletter of the person.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.720]   But isn't it too much work for...
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720]   I mean, I agree with you.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.840]   I think you should post natively.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.840]   I don't...
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.280]   On buzz, I don't pipe anything into buzz.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280]   I just buzz.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.840]   But I do pipe my buzz into Twitter.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.840]   Okay.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.840]   I've never seen that.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   I think you should post...
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.760]   Well, only because it's the same kind of content.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.960]   But I think you should post natively in the language of the medium.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960]   But who has time?
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960]   Right.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.960]   We're not gonna create a...
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:07.960]   Right.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.960]   Well, when anything's to update, we've seen anything.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.400]   And then that begs the question of branding yourself as well, because a lot of times people
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:20.040]   want your personality inside of your brand, even though we are news journalists.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   Right.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   We're different.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.040]   I think we're probably not normal in any respect.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040]   But...
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.040]   Hey, can I ask a dumb question?
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.040]   Yes, please.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.200]   You know, I was at the...
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.120]   I was not at South by Southwest.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.280]   I was at the Home and House Wear Show in Chicago.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.280]   Which was much more fun, I'm sure.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.280]   So you know what to try?
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.280]   I didn't want to brag, but...
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.680]   There's no pressure to drink, at least.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.680]   They're right.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.680]   Yeah, really.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.880]   When they say drink the Kool-Aid, they really mean Kool-Aid.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:51.480]   But, you know, one of the words that I've just heard come out so much from South by Southwest
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.680]   is this, "We're curating, curating."
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.720]   And I get the concept, but what is the genesis of this word?
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.040]   Why is this such a huge concept now?
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.600]   Can one of the learned, you know, Natalie could no doubt throw out some names and really
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.800]   impress me, but can you just give me the synopsis of curate and why it's such a big deal now?
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.360]   I can tell you something, because I'm an old guy.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360]   Yeah, good.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360]   Don't put the pressure on the other side.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.720]   Just think of some big names you can drop and knob back in a sec.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   No.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.000]   I can tell you, because I'm an old guy, because I've watched this happen.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   So what happened was when the internet turned on, it turned on a fire hose of information,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.720]   and immediately it became apparent that there was no differentiation between good and bad,
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.040]   that there was too much to absorb, and it became very clear.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.720]   In fact, early on in the internet, remember these meta pages?
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.760]   I know you're old enough, Becky, to remember that.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.720]   That was Dvorak's game for a while.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720]   Right.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.080]   So if you wanted to know everything there was to know about cricket, you wouldn't go one
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.480]   by one to all the cricket pages.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:51.440]   You try to find a cricket-accureded cricket collection of pages.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.040]   That's what Wikipedia is, really, is a curated link.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.800]   So what happened very quickly is we realized we can't follow it all, so we need to follow
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.080]   somebody who's curating it.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.400]   And that's just an information management problem.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.680]   I think we had to do that.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.640]   And by the way, where's the money on the net?
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.560]   The aggregator and the curator.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:14.080]   So that's why at South by Southwest, people are interested in that.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.840]   It's kind of Mark Zuckerberg's small scale.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:21.000]   Mark wants to curate everything known on the net so that you go through Facebook, and he
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.320]   can reap all the gold.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.080]   And really, if anybody is doing curation, that's what they're hoping, that you will go to buzz
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:35.040]   out loud or CNET or CBS, because that's where we will make sense of this flood.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.960]   And not only platforms are curators, but people, instead of just being storytellers,
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.880]   are curators too.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.400]   Well, that's another kind of curation, isn't it?
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   Making sense of it.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   That's what a journalist does.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.800]   A journalist takes the facts, but doesn't just, I mean, there's a reporter who reports
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.320]   the facts, but a true journalist takes the facts, reports them, and then makes sense
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.600]   of them.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.400]   If you don't make sense of it.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.880]   And it goes to the source, doesn't, isn't just a wire service, but actually goes to source
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:03.520]   or finds their own angle that is different from the rest.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.320]   All we do on this show, all we do on this show is tell stories.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.920]   This show, every show I do, is a meta show.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:17.320]   We don't go out there and at the field and do the stories, we'll let you guys do that.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.080]   Then we bring in people who say, "Well, here are the facts that others have gathered.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.080]   This is what it means."
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.280]   Well, Becky, are you sort of knitting your brow at the word curate, because it sounds
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:32.600]   like what big networks try to do, which is bring in information that you decide, that
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.160]   they decide that we're going to consume?
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.080]   I guess it was just more the context, sort of the tipping point in the sense of the social
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:46.400]   media world, because it seems like this word took on a new meaning and just, I've seen
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.960]   it everywhere in the last four weeks.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.680]   It's like it, if it had a graph of this use in context, it would be on a straight hockey
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.880]   puck scale right now.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.800]   And I'm just wondering if there was something that tipped it in this context, because I
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.400]   just didn't know where that came from.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.680]   Well, we're low on buzzwords.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.200]   There was semantic web for a while, and before that it was web 2.0.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.200]   So maybe-
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.200]   It's a buzzword deficit, I think.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.560]   Maybe curate is the next big thing.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.960]   To me, Becky, the thing that made me nauseous to South by Southwest is I met- everybody I
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.280]   met was a social media consultant or a social media expert.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.280]   Yes, we're sick of that.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.080]   That means we just graduated from college.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.080]   Right.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.920]   I know how to use Twitter.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.440]   And what's sad is there's a gold rush, and I think a lot of these people are making
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:30.680]   money, hucks during big corporations are going, "What is Twitter?"
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.440]   And they'll bring in some college kids and say, "Well, let me tell you, I can show you
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.440]   how you use Twitter."
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.640]   Well, that was like the whole George Clooney movie up in the air where the girl comes out
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:40.160]   of college and says, "Well, I know how to use video chat."
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.000]   So I'm the next big thing.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.800]   And then you realize that there's something to be said about age and experience.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:46.800]   That was a great movie.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.680]   Actually, I have to say video chat and age and experience are working for me.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.760]   I ran into an old colleague of ours, a photographer, Mark Newling.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.320]   Leo, I don't know if you worked with him.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.640]   And he saw me and he said, "Becky, I've seen your Skype live shots on ABC.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.160]   I was worried for you when you were in the studio and everything was in HD.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:08.200]   But now that you're compressed on Skype, you're pretty good at all that time."
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.720]   You know, I have to say though, and we've been observing this today, and I've watched
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.720]   you on GMA.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.120]   You're doing Skype on GMA.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.320]   It looks, what did they do?
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.320]   You look fantastic.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.320]   You look lovely.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.320]   Is it lighting?
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.400]   Do they put real lights in there?
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.280]   Do you have a super huge bandwidth?
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.280]   What is it?
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:28.040]   It's just completely my own rig, bubble gum and bailing wire that I clued together.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.120]   And while I do have a Canon GL2.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120]   Oh, that's it.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.120]   Firewired in.
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.120]   Okay, that's it.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.120]   That's why.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.120]   Okay.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.200]   Because it's all other problems, but we won't talk about that.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:44.080]   I have a desk lamp over here, and the real thing is, is while I upgraded from DSL to
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:49.520]   cable modem that had no impact on the quality of the shot, here's the secret.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.960]   Look at the colors behind me.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.520]   There's two colors.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.080]   White and black.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.080]   Right.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.080]   And it's not rich.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.560]   It's not textured.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:03.120]   The monochromatic thing going on behind me, which is my kitchen, and I keep it tight so
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.680]   you can't see the children's bottles littered all around me.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.600]   I think that because it's so monochromatic, it doesn't compress as much.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.600]   That's my theory.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.600]   Yeah, because look at my background.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.880]   It's a little busy, I'll say.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.000]   But I do notice what I do with our guests in studio.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.240]   I do put red velvet drapes behind them in very simple background.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.880]   I have no art on my walls, and I've lived here for two years.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.760]   Yeah, you got the same thing going on, sure.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.760]   I'm like a guy.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.080]   I'm like a guy the way I live.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:35.080]   Well, well, let me ask you, do you have a red leather sofa?
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.080]   No.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.080]   OK, because that's the guy sofa.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.720]   But you should see my fridge.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.720]   Empty?
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.720]   A lot of room.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.720]   Condiments only.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.720]   Pickles and then--
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.720]   Pickles.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:46.720]   Yeah, pickles.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.720]   Mine and liquor.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.720]   Pickles and condiments.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.720]   That's the guy-- the guy fridge.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:51.720]   All right.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:52.720]   See, Sheriff, you've subscribed to Blippi.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.720]   I'd already know all this.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:54.720]   Do you prefer?
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.040]   That's what we need, refrigerator feed.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   I got it.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.040]   The next big thing.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.040]   We're going to take a break.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.680]   We are going to compare Audible books and then come back with more news.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.320]   This is-- this week in Tech, we're glad you're here.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:10.240]   Of course, Audible is-- sponsored-- has been with us for, I think, three years now.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.000]   What a great company.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.360]   75-- I just got the new number.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:20.840]   75,000 books, lectures, performances, radio shows.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.840]   Great audio content.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.520]   Of course, the books are really why you go there.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.760]   You're audio bookstore.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.400]   And I listen all the time.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.200]   I'm listening right now.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.240]   You're going to mock me when I tell you this.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:35.240]   My wife was listening to this book and I just love it.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.760]   She loved it and she said, "You've got to listen."
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.160]   Christopher Buckley, who's William F. Buckley's son, he wrote, "Thank you for not smoking"
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.960]   and a bunch of other great stuff, wrote a memoir of his mother and father when they
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:46.960]   passed away.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.920]   And I really, really like it.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.480]   But this is the beauty of it.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:58.760]   This is your listening in the-- in Dead Times, in the car, at the gym, cleaning house, walking
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.600]   the dog.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.440]   It's hard to describe, but you feel like you can listen to a broader range of stuff.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.040]   You have more reading time.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.440]   You can discover reading again.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.640]   That's what Francine Harderway told me.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:12.600]   She said, "I've given up on reading and thanks to Audible, I'm reading again."
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.160]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.560]   That's the URL to go to.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.280]   Take a look at Audible.com, browse around, find a book you like.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.800]   And when you go to Audible.com/Twit2, you'll be signing up for a platinum account.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.720]   That's two books a month and the first two are free.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.720]   You can cancel anytime.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:30.120]   So this is a way to get two free books, frankly.
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.800]   Sarah Silverman's new book is out.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:37.360]   Do you love Sarah Silverman or is she too kind of scatological for you?
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.560]   Oh, no, I like scatological.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.120]   I can do that.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.120]   You're going to like this then.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:46.280]   Her new book is called The Bedwetter, Stories of Courage, Redemption, and P.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.280]   Cute.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   I like her.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.280]   That's intriguing.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.080]   It's hard not to listen.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.080]   Look at the picture.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.080]   I mean, she's very heroic.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080]   And it's read by Sarah, but that's just an example.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:03.280]   I'm sure that's fairly adult, so keep that in mind.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:09.400]   Audible has all the bestsellers, great science fiction collection, wonderful books you're
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.920]   going to love, and I invite you to try too on me.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:21.160]   Audible.com/twit2audible.com/twit2.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:27.560]   They play on, of course, the iPad, the iPhone, the iPods, all of them, the Zoom, the Kindle,
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:34.240]   most GPS devices that play MP3s will also play Audible books, hundreds of platforms.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.240]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.240]   Give them a try.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.240]   I think you're going to like it.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.880]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.920]   Thank you for a quick Audible plug.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:42.920]   Yeah, would you?
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.960]   You know the woman who's 90, something and got the first iPad?
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.280]   She did it because she needed the magnification on the reader because she's got low vision.
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.000]   Well, one in 28 Americans over the age of 40 has low vision.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.320]   So Audible.com, Kindle magnification, iPad magnification is revolutionary.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.320]   I agree.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.520]   My mom is 75 and she'd stopped reading.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.200]   I gave her a Kindle.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.240]   She made it the biggest text and she said, "I can read."
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.400]   She says, "My eyes don't get to..."
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.800]   She's reading and reading and reading.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.360]   I completely agree.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.360]   Oh.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.360]   That's nice.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:21.440]   Also, I was reading Real Simple Magazine this week and there was a plug in there for podcasters.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.600]   It was tips to incent you to clean.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.760]   And this one woman said, "I only listen to podcasts while I'm cleaning."
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.520]   And I love them so much that it makes the cleaning go really fast.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.520]   So there's your podcasting plug.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.680]   That's true for me for audio books actually.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.960]   And I've listened to a lot of podcasts too.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.080]   If you listen to podcast audio books, just give you another dimension you can add.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.560]   You read Real Simple, really?
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.200]   Look at her house.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.200]   It's real.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.200]   It's simple.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200]   Simple.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.840]   And have I told you my new exercise plan?
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.840]   No.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:54.800]   I only let myself play iPhone games when I'm on the elliptical...
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:55.800]   Smarty.
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:56.800]   Smarty.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.420]   So I have been doing like five hours a week of elliptical while playing plants versus
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:02.420]   zombies.
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:03.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:06.120]   See, if you get hooked on plants versus zombies, you'll do anything to play.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.320]   So if it's just elliptical, no problem.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.320]   You can't really play...
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.760]   Oh, no, we're talking iPad actually.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:16.400]   Because I've done some iPad games on the elliptical and it's very hard with the accelerometer.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.400]   I've almost fallen off.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   Well, you've got to rest it on the thing.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.560]   Don't you have a music stand or something that you put on?
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.720]   She's got her own stand now.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.720]   It's getting bigger every week.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:24.720]   No, she puts it on her belly.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.640]   Well, no wonder you put it on the belly.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.640]   It's not going to work.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.640]   No, you've got to put it on the ledge.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.800]   But if you're doing something where you're going to try and tip it, you can't do that
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.800]   on the elliptical.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:33.800]   No one's that coordinated.
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.040]   Godfinger is very hard when you're going on the elliptical because you're bouncing up
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.040]   and down and it's very hard.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.880]   Oh, I hope you're watching the video of this because it's...
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.880]   Do you have you played Godfinger?
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.880]   No.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:44.880]   It's on my list.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   Don't get...
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.880]   Don't...
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:47.880]   Don't...
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.080]   I play We Rule and Godfinger, which are basically the farmville of iPad games.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.960]   We Rule is a farm and you know you raise crops and stuff.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   That's okay because he doesn't take a lot of attention.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:00.400]   Godfinger, you're the giant finger that makes it rain, makes the sunshine.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400]   You have a planet.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.840]   You have followers.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:03.920]   They worship you.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.560]   You could pick them up with your finger, drag them to other warehouses.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.560]   You can make them rain.
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.560]   And it's...
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:09.560]   It's not good.
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.720]   Don't do yourself a favor.
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.160]   You'll never get that time back.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.960]   It's gone forever.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:15.960]   Gone forever.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   There are iPad games that are very compelling though, I have to say.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.960]   So you got...
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:20.960]   Is it Plants vs. Zombies?
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.960]   You're number one pick, Becky?
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.440]   That's been a complete time suck.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.760]   And then Diner Dash, stuff like that.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.760]   That's fun.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.760]   Oh yeah, Diner Dash.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.360]   They have that on the iPad.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.960]   I take all recommendations people have for games.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.960]   Be Wirly at Twitter.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.400]   Well be my friend on We Rule and we can have a farm together.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.400]   Okay, we'll...
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.240]   We know how that goes with you guys.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.800]   Do any of you play farmville?
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.640]   I'm not in a farmville.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.800]   I started doing it.
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.720]   I barely take care of my own plants in person.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.720]   Good.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:54.720]   Let alone virtually.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.720]   I'm very impressed.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:59.560]   No, I'm so busy dating and reading social theory.
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.560]   It's good to be able to dance with kids.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.440]   Now this is going to be a killer app on iPad.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:08.320]   Hulu is going to have a Hulu plus $10 a month.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.120]   And I think they're going to have an iPad app.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.440]   Okay, here's the question.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.880]   Would you pay $10 a month for Hulu?
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   Easy.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:15.880]   You watch enough Hulu that makes it worthwhile.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.880]   I do.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.880]   But there's two things I want from Hulu.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:19.880]   I want the Daily Show back.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.880]   It's not there anymore.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.880]   It's still not there.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.880]   Pastures.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   I know.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.080]   And I don't want to be advertised too if I do have to pay $10 a month.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.080]   You're right.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.320]   In fact, if they take the ads off $10 a month, no problem.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.320]   Right.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.320]   But if they have to watch ads.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.760]   I mean, I do like Ragu, but you know, enough already.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.000]   Or Crest or Colgate or whatever.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.440]   They do that on on demand too.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.040]   And it drives me crazy when you watch 30 Rock on demand.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.360]   And they don't have enough ads.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.720]   So it's the same ad three times.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.720]   It's very annoying.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.480]   And sometimes they don't complain about ads.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.480]   I like getting paid.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.480]   No, I'm not complaining.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.480]   Right.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.280]   But this is a different way to get paid directly from our viewers, which I'd be okay with.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.280]   And that's the wrong with that.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.280]   Yeah, that's a different thing.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.280]   That's okay.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:08.760]   And it's interesting because Phyllis says they made $100 million, which is not enough
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.920]   for the networks.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.080]   And so they've got to create a wait a minute.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.320]   They made $100 million and it's not enough.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.200]   That's little that small beans for the networks.
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:24.400]   This is why I succeed because I would take I take it 100th of that and be happy.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.400]   100 million.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.400]   It's not a network.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.040]   The networks are greedy counting up to the biggest army three of the biggest ones owning
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.040]   Hulu.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:34.880]   But that's what happened to tech TV is that we may, you know, we, you know, we could,
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:39.240]   you couldn't make enough money to make it worthwhile because it's so expensive to do
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.560]   a channel.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.680]   It's crazy expensive given the production.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:46.800]   I mean, what you've excelled at Leo is organic growth with minimal production costs.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.800]   Thank you.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800]   That's a very nice way to put it.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.800]   And then these guys are out here.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.800]   You're a union, right?
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.800]   No union.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:57.640]   No, no, I, but I, you know what, I, I pay them union wages and I give them health and
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.360]   I give them retirement 401k.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.560]   I give them, they get, they're taken care of.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.960]   I wouldn't mind a union in here.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.960]   That'd be okay.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.320]   Hey, you're sending Dane to New York with me next week.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.320]   That's right.
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.400]   I'm just going to come hang out with you, learn how to, how the big guys do it so we can laugh.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.800]   I actually think what's going to happen is he's going to come to the set of GMA and he's
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.920]   going to recognize that really everybody's just flying by.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.720]   Nobody knows what they're doing.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.720]   Nobody does.
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:22.720]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.960]   So according to paid content.org, online people watch video on 2.6 different devices
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:30.400]   a week.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:37.040]   Young adults age, 18 to 34 watch on 3.3 different devices a week.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:42.720]   TV, PC, iPhone, MP3 player.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:47.040]   They estimate that by 2015 people will use four or five different devices each week.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.720]   So that's not, we're simplifying.
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.400]   I thought we were trying to simplify how.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.400]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.080]   It's one of the, it's one of the things driving what our strategy, which is to get on as many
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.280]   devices as possible.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.200]   So that you can wake up to your iPhone, but get up and watch it on the TV, then get in
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.000]   the car and you can watch it everywhere.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.200]   I think that's a sensible strategy.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.720]   Who do you content to open?
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720]   Let's see.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:16.000]   So hulu.com, would you pay for?
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   10 bucks.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   I don't know.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   No ads I might.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   How about you, Shira?
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.440]   I don't, I mean, there's always going to be another way to get it for free unless, yeah,
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.440]   the content is high quality enough.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.440]   Get ready.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.440]   I see.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:34.240]   According to hulu, they're going to increase the ad load at first to 12 ads per 45 minute
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.240]   show.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.240]   That's 12 ads an hour.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.240]   Then eventually.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.240]   Doing experience.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240]   Then eventually.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:46.200]   I'll just show with 24 ads in a 45 minute show.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.320]   I encourage them to do that.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.320]   Please.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.320]   Uh, at that point, you know, you should do something totally novel.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.320]   Watch it on TV.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.320]   Yeah, really.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.320]   I mean, it's just weird how it all just starts circling back on itself.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:04.920]   But well, they're pushing people to watch to Tivo it and watch it on TV and skip the
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.360]   ads.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.320]   If you only watch on computer, 10 bucks is nothing.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:10.320]   Right.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.320]   I mean, the average cable bill is something like 80 or 90 bucks a month.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.320]   It's crazy.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:20.760]   Let's not forget that the competition for all this stuff is stealing.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:26.480]   BitTorrent that you can get it without ads in high def downloading it.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.560]   And that's the competition.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.560]   That's what they have to face, right?
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.120]   I still think it's easier to go to go to my wine destination.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:38.440]   Hulu who I trust, it has everything I need, you know, right when I want to see it.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.440]   I don't have the patience.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.400]   Sometimes you can go through the torrents.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.320]   No, that's, that's, that's what the only thing protecting these guys is that the bit
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.840]   torrent is still hard to use.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.840]   All right.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840]   How about this?
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.640]   YouTube has taken down all the Hitler movies.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.280]   Can you back me into this story?
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.720]   Because I kind of kept reading the headlines.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.680]   And by the way, it's YouTube's fifth birthday.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.680]   Happy birthday, YouTube.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:58.680]   Happy birthday.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:04.520]   Well, it's the, it, I actually called them this week because the networks wanted to do
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.600]   something about this.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.200]   It's, it's the fifth anniversary of the day that the first video was uploaded internally,
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   but it wasn't public.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.200]   When it, because it doesn't.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.600]   It wasn't public until May of 2005.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.080]   I remember we, I was doing call for help in Toronto and Amber MacArthur about four and
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:24.240]   a half years ago said, Oh, there's this new site where you can put videos of people
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.320]   getting kicked in the crotch.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.680]   And I thought this is stupid.
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:29.760]   And then we interviewed the, was it, is this Steve Chen?
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.520]   We interviewed one of the founders early on before they were bought by Google and I asked
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.960]   him and I said, well, how are you going to survive with bandwidth costs and piracy issues?
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:44.840]   And I think in the back of his head, he was thinking Google, the Google, it's the Google
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:45.840]   life preserver.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:53.080]   So one of the ways that YouTube protects itself is they support DMC a takedowns.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.520]   If you request a takedown, you can.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:02.320]   So you've all seen these far too many parody rants where they take the clip of the movie
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.800]   The Downfall, which is the rise at the end of the third Reich.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.760]   And who is the wonderful, is it Bruno?
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.760]   Is it Bruno Gantz?
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.240]   Who is the wonderful actor?
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:14.440]   He is playing Hitler.
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:15.520]   So that's a commercial film.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:19.200]   And what they do is they take off, they subtitle it.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:25.080]   And it's, you know, I'm mad about whatever PS three being, you know, like no copy and
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.680]   paste on the iPhone.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:30.080]   That's not okay.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.720]   So they're taking them down now.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:40.320]   So you're not going to see any Hitler parodies unless you create your own original.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.320]   Let me see.
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.320]   Here's one.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:48.120]   There are several Hitler downfall parodies on YouTube.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.120]   We were able to watch.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.400]   Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing how much longer they'll be there.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.400]   At least we're looking.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.560]   At the end of the week, it's as possible.
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.360]   YouTube will have removed all of the downfall parody videos.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.320]   I'm sure the one about Michael Jackson's death is still up and available.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:09.120]   Then they look at each other.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.120]   It seems.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.920]   It seems like a constant film.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.200]   A.G. has submitted a copyright violation.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.200]   YouTube had no choice but to take it down.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.520]   Oh, Hitler's about to lose it.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:26.720]   Oh, the slow burn is what I like.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:29.520]   I've taken thousands.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.440]   I'm like, we're Jackson.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.960]   He's going to lose it.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.960]   Everyone who has submitted a takedown notice to you on behalf of constant films.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.960]   A.G.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.120]   Please leave some room now.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.800]   Anyway, I won't go on you.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.800]   I'll leave this to you.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.800]   Let's not give Hitler more attention.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.800]   Really?
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:45.800]   Jeez.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:53.640]   So these were really popular, but apparently they were also quite offensive to some people.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.160]   Well, it's also somebody's content.
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:30:00.960]   It is a copyright violation, but also it hadn't even occurred to me that it would be
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.280]   offensive in this way.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.280]   I don't know.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.480]   Is it because it's always offensive?
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:08.200]   Is it because it's offensive or it's because it's copyright violation?
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:11.000]   I was just wearing the headlines all week thinking, oh, good.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   They got me.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000]   Yeah, I was sick of them.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   I didn't want to see anymore.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   They got text.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.720]   I didn't find it offensive, but I mean, it's a movie.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:23.400]   It was the producers from the film that came and just went to YouTube and alerted YouTube.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.520]   So I don't think they found it offensive.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.560]   Obviously, they created a movie.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.760]   They got fed up.
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:32.320]   Yeah, they just got fed up with people remixing their content.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:36.320]   Nobody's ever going to be able to see that film again without thinking about Michael Jackson.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:42.360]   Probably not what they intended.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.760]   I think we've covered all the stories.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.320]   Anything else anybody wants to talk about?
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.120]   I hear that Natalie Del Conte is expecting.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.120]   Oh, God.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.080]   That's not a topic.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.040]   That's not up for discussion, actually.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.040]   Stop the press.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.040]   Stop the press.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.120]   It's so great to see you, Natalie.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.120]   Thank you for coming in.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.120]   Thank you for bringing Mom.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.120]   Nice to see you again.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.120]   Thank you for having us.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.120]   I hope you enjoyed the wine.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.920]   Natalie Del Conte does many things, but you can find out more about her on her website.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:06.920]   NatalieDel Conte.com.com.
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:11.920]   You can follow her on Twitter, N-A-T-A-L-I-D-E-L-C-O-N-T-E.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:14.040]   Yeah, no E.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.320]   No E on Twitter because he ran out of letters.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.000]   No E on Natalie.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000]   No E on Natalie.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000]   Okay.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.360]   We'll see you on CNET all the time, of course, on CBS.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.360]   My daily show is called loaded.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.440]   And this week I'm filling in for Tom, who's somewhere in the Mediterranean or something
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.440]   like that.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.440]   He's in Hawaii.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.440]   He was going to go to IFA, the big cell phone conference.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.800]   I thought he was joking about being driving to Hawaii.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.680]   No, he was going to go to Barcelona.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:39.680]   And maybe he did.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:40.680]   Because of the...
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:45.280]   Well, they canceled IFA because of the ash cloud.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.280]   And so he said, "Well, how about that?
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.280]   We're going to Hawaii."
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.920]   So that's where he is right now.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:52.680]   Well, I'll be sitting in the big boy chair then at Buzzat Loud this week in San Francisco.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:53.680]   That's great.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.320]   And of course, Tom is going to be joining us June 1st.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.520]   I am aware of that.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.320]   We stole him away.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.240]   We stole him away.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.000]   Cheryl Azar is the digital correspondent for CBS.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.440]   And you can read her stuff at CBSNews.com.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.320]   Always a pleasure to see you share.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.560]   Come up and see us sometime.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.560]   I know.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.560]   Thanks for having me.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.560]   Love having you.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:20.200]   And of course, my old friend Becky Worley loaned her since the days of tech TV where she
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:25.000]   was the launch producer for both the screensavers and call for help.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.560]   And now is a GMA covering tech for ABC.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.560]   Thank you for being here, Becky.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   Pleasurely.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.560]   I appreciate it.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.560]   You can watch this show.
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.080]   We do it live every Sunday afternoon at 6 p.m. Pacific.
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.080]   I'm sorry, 6 p.m.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.960]   Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:42.960]   That's 2,200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:48.640]   We then take the carefully produced video, bleep out all the expletives and put the audio

[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.520]   Another twit.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.520]   Who's in the can?
