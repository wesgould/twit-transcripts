[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.760]   TPM 2.0 edition joining us. Denise Howell is great to have her from our former wonderful
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.160]   show this week in law. She is an IP attorney also at Denise Howell.info blogger. She's also
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.600]   at the howl on the Twitter and Instagram and a fashionista to boot. Hi Denise. Hi great
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.520]   to be here. Nice to see you. Everything well in the kitchen. Everything well is in the
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.720]   kitchen in the living room. Pretty much the only thing you're in. You're not in the kitchen
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.760]   anymore. No, I'm not in the kitchen. Never mind. That's not a sexist. I didn't mean it
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.280]   that way. I think I remember you being in your kitchen sometimes. No, you do. Absolutely.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.800]   That was more than a decade ago. Oh my God. We've known each other for a long time. That's
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.480]   the source of my confusion. Nice to see you. Also with us, another guy I've known I think
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.280]   even longer than Denise Ed bot from the Ed bot where he's eating Ed. It has been decades.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.160]   It's the mid 90s when you first started appearing on Devorak on computers. Our radio show back
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.560]   in the early 90s. So nice to see you Ed. I think you can guess why Ed might be here
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.080]   today along with Daniel Rubino. It's good to see you executive editor at Windows Central.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.200]   We've got the... Thank you for having me. No, it's great to have you. We have the Windows
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.280]   team in town because Microsoft announced Windows 11. It will not be the only subject of the
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.600]   day, but we certainly have to talk about it. It's really interesting. Microsoft, with its
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.400]   announcement, raised far more questions than it answered. It really has become a like,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.680]   "What about... What about... What about... What about..." And in fact, even in the post
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.200]   announcement communications, Microsoft has been confused itself apparently. So let's
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.040]   just start talking about Windows 11. Microsoft announced it on Thursday. We covered the announcement.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.120]   We have a stream of that on our Twit News feed and then did a special edition of Windows
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.320]   Weekly to talk about it. The first thing I guess we should say preemptively is Microsoft
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.080]   never said that Windows 10 is the last version of Windows. It was widely reported, but it
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.040]   turns out it was just some guy. Jerry Nixon has said it, the developer advocate once, and
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.760]   Microsoft never denied it. Clearly, Windows 10 is not the last version of Windows. Daniel
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.560]   is Windows 11 on schedule. It's right about five years, right?
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.240]   Yeah. The original announcement of Windows 10, obviously what they were typing more,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.720]   was more about Windows as a service, this concept that they'll just be constantly updated
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.320]   forever and there will be new versions of refreshes to it. They never said it as you
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.360]   pointed out though about the name. And Windows 11, you know, we haven't written this story
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.400]   yet about how Windows 11 came to be because obviously Windows 10x was somewhere in between
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.600]   there and Windows 11 borrows a lot from that operating system. So it's really interesting
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.320]   to see, but yeah, it's on schedule to release in October. And so they're going to start
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   shipping the insider build this week and then four months to go. And so they have a lot
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.080]   of time to clarify and adjust things, which I think they definitely need to do. But it's
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.640]   going to be coming out this year.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.840]   I think the picture was also a little muddied by the leaked release of Windows 11 that
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.000]   came out last week that was unfinished. And I think people made decisions about what
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.920]   Windows 11 was going to be based on what was clearly an early beta release.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.760]   Do we know where that version came from? There was speculation Microsoft released it on purpose
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.640]   to lower expectations. That can't. That's not right.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:37.920]   No, that A, they're not that good. And B, you know, there's just the result wasn't what
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.680]   you would expect if someone had leaked that on purpose. No, I think there's there's a
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.680]   you can try all you want to prevent leaks from happening, but you have to share code
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.040]   with partners along the way. And there's always, you know, if you share it with 100
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.920]   partners, all you need to do is have one who, you know, lets it out and and then the games,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   you know, and then the games over there. It did spoil a lot of the thunder.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.360]   And the real problem is that it caused people to focus on the user experience, the surface
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.240]   element stuff, instead of focusing on the totality of the picture where, you know, the
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.920]   user experience is a big deal of it. But the stuff like, you know, being able to run Android
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:35.280]   apps in a Windows subsystem for Android is something that nobody noticed in the leaked
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.440]   build as far as I know. Right. And in fact, that was the kind of the one more thing of
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.440]   Panos Panet's discussion. He even he kind of glossed over it. But boy, it sure caught
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.640]   my attention when they talked about the new app store, the new app store wasn't in this
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.920]   leaked build. He mentioned that it will include not only when 32 apps and PWA apps. I'm sorry,
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   UWP apps. I get the acronyms confused, but also and PWA and PWA.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   And PWA. Everything's in there now. Everything's in there now. Yeah, I think other stores.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.280]   Yeah. Yes. Oh, and that was another thing. You can, and this was very much a shot across
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.920]   the bow of Apple. You can also use your own e-commerce platform and we won't take a penny,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.760]   Microsoft said. I think you're going to see a lot of sub stores join. They want steam
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.720]   in there. You know, we know Amazon is obviously on board for Android. That doesn't though
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.600]   prevent Samsung from joining as well. I'd be shocked if Samsung doesn't bring its own
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.720]   stores own Galaxy store to its own laptops to run its own Android apps on there. That
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:52.840]   seems that's totally open. I mean, Google technically could join as well. Why not the
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:59.120]   Google Play Store? Why choose the Amazon store? Well, I think Google won't. That's why.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.240]   Oh, so I think Amazon, which just they had relationships there already, Amazon store
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:10.560]   is not known to be amazing, but it's, you know, it's workable and it's a start. So get
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.280]   an Amazon, I believe Samsung will probably join too. Maybe Google will come down the
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.560]   line if all this proves popular, which to be honest, there are questions about the
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.880]   value boldness of running Android apps and Windows. We don't know if it's actually going
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.440]   to be a good experience or useful, but I think there's a lot of opportunity here and
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.480]   yeah, I don't know. We'll have to wait and see what happens with that all.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.080]   People who are following closely might remember that Microsoft had its own Android bridge,
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.440]   which they killed. So they're using Intel something no one ever heard of, which is Intel's
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.640]   Android bridge. Did you guys know about Intel's Android bridge before?
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:58.080]   We don't know much about that. Had you heard of it? No, no, no, we heard about that.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:06.640]   On the day, you know, I went and looked and Intel released Intel put out a press release.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.480]   But it sounds like they had just heard about it as well. Yeah, just great. Right. And they
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.720]   then refuse to answer any more questions about it. So basically what it is is a, you know,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:25.240]   it's a runtime compiler that turns and turns ARM instructions into x86 instructions.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.320]   Oh, how interesting executed does so that's so runtime means it's done by the operating
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.480]   system, not by the developer. The developer doesn't have to modify their app or in Silicon.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:44.160]   It's not the operation, but by the processor. Right. So yeah, so when the program runs,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:54.560]   the program is written for Android for an ARM architecture and then those instructions
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:06.920]   get recompiled in at runtime and then get executed by the x86 processor. And we'll see, you know,
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.760]   Intel doesn't have a great track record at doing stuff like this. So I'm going to be
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:20.680]   curious to see how well it works. And by the way, one thing to add to what Daniel said,
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:29.440]   the Amazon App Store is, you know, its whole, its purpose in life is to deliver apps for,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:36.440]   you know, Kindle, fire tablets generally. You know, that's what it does. The only app,
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.120]   I looked at it and I thought, what's what app would I want to run on a Windows PC that
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.400]   could come from the Amazon App Store? And the one that just leaped out at me is I've
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:53.680]   got a Surface tablet and I would love to be able to read Kindle books on it. And so having
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:01.720]   the Kindle app that's written by Amazon, that's in a, you know, in an APK, being able
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:07.400]   to just run that on my Surface would suddenly make my Surface useful in places where right
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.720]   now I have to put it away and take out either an iPad or a Kindle device. So that's the one
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.360]   thing where I could see some immediate value, but I can't see much beyond that.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.720]   Microsoft showed TikTok.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:32.920]   I think some of the arguments I've heard for this is IOT apps and smart home apps and,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   heck, even my Tesla, right, the Tesla app, I could run and write on my computer, I could
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.600]   turn the heat on or warm it up or do whatever. So I think it's going to be a lot of small,
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.360]   little, little things. And to be honest, maybe that's all it needs to do, right? It's just
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.600]   that one app that someone really wants that they can now run. And the performance should
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.120]   be good, right? This isn't Bluestacks. This is going to be, you know, you know, as Ed explained,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.760]   this runs, I think a little bit better.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.880]   Yeah, Bluestacks was an emulator that really didn't do a great job.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.680]   Yeah, use a lot of processor requirements on that. But this also will work on AMD and,
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:12.200]   of course, Qualcomm's arm chips. So I'm not really sure the Intel bridge, I think it's
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:19.520]   for Intel chips, but it doesn't preclude this from running on AMD and Qualcomm. So, but we
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.840]   got it. There's a lot we need to find out about how this all works.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:28.600]   Well, and in fact, Intel did say that they are working with AMD to run it on Ryzen chips.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:36.180]   Oh, interesting. Yeah, it will run on Ryzen. And it won't actually be necessary on
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:43.760]   I mean, I guess it would have to be necessary to run on arm chips. But if you have something
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:50.700]   like a Surface Pro X or the Lenovo Yoga C630, like I have here, which have an ARM processor
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:57.760]   inside already, I'm really curious to see how that story plays out.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.760]   What does it mean?
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.220]   Well, it's Microsoft. It'll, I was going to say, you know, Microsoft, it's going to translate
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:08.160]   from ARM to X86, BAFTA, ARM. I can see that happening.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.880]   What does it mean strategically for Microsoft? Does it mean, I think, you know, at the end,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.820]   I thought Sachin Adela's comments at the end were really great. I thought very interesting
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:22.960]   and clearly also aimed at Apple. He was really saying, he said, Windows has always stood for
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:31.360]   sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers. And he's also been the guy who has consistently
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:38.260]   said since he became CEO at Microsoft that we want to be everywhere our customers are,
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:44.340]   which is a kind of a big change from Microsoft's original, you know, mission statement, which
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:49.180]   is to get everybody in the world to run Windows. It now really looks like Microsoft wants to
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:55.780]   be because of Azure and the cloud and so forth, wants to be everywhere, including part of Android,
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.720]   part of Mac. Is that what this says? Is it's the universal platform?
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:10.000]   Yes. Well, the original mission statement for Microsoft was a PC on every desktop running
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.800]   Microsoft software. Right. And so what you have now is you basically turn that in reverse.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.920]   Microsoft software running on every desktop on a PC or anything else.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:30.120]   Anywhere you are wherever you want to. Yeah. Yeah. That also raises the windows as a service,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.280]   which Microsoft seem to have backed down. They said we're only going to update this once
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:40.960]   a year. Isn't Microsoft this year going to announce a virtual Windows desktop as well?
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:50.600]   Wow. PC. Yeah. Cloud PC. So it's really it's a it's a interesting change for Microsoft.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:57.800]   It sounds like from such is words that really they want to be a platform for everybody everywhere,
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:03.880]   something like that. Not a bad idea. It's just so wildly different from the 90s, right?
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:09.040]   I mean, I don't know that whole sovereignty for consumers thing flashed me right back
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:17.160]   to not being able to download mosaic and Windows 95. It is it they're a long way from that,
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.960]   I guess. Well, and there are a lot of consumers who are saying sovereignty. What are you talking
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.640]   about? I can't run this on my late model PC. Let's let's talk about compatibility.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:33.160]   Oh boy. Really that was. Oh, before we do that before we leave, I just I want to mention,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.560]   Daniel, you wrote about this in Windows Center, some other people did. It won't just be the Amazon
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:43.880]   app store. You will be also able to sideload Android apps onto Windows. Yeah. So that's
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.840]   nice. I mean, I think for developers, that's super important, but yeah, it literally means you can
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:54.120]   somehow get a hold of an APK. You can just sideload it into Windows and run it that way.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.320]   Well, there's a lot of Android users know the there's APK libraries all over the place.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.280]   Mirrors all over the APK mirror is the biggest one. So you'll be able to get apps. So that's
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.920]   very interesting. And do we think all apps will run or is it'll be even on the Chrome OS, you can't
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.880]   run all Android apps? That's the question. And how do they run? Can you like, you know,
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.240]   add brought up the Kindle app, which is really neat. But will that run full screen? Right. And
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:25.000]   then it'll take talk. Look like it was a phone app on top of Windows. Right. Yes. I think there'll
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.160]   be limits, but that may be sort of the goal here too, because maybe Android developers will start
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.120]   modifying their apps to run on larger screens. You know, there's like a lot of play here in terms of
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.400]   what this means, you know, for apps. But right now, Microsoft's taking a very neutral position on
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.080]   apps in the store. Basically, any store can join the Microsoft store. You can keep all the money.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   And we'll run any app when 32 PWA, UWP, it doesn't matter whatever developers feel more
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.240]   comfortable using. They can use that. It's definitely, you know, it's an East Point. That's a very
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.200]   different approach. But we've been seeing this trajectory ever since around 2015 Microsoft
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.560]   opening everything. And this is just a further evidence of that. Yeah, this is such an Adele
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:14.440]   strategy. Yeah. And let me just add one one more thing to what Daniel said in there. The store,
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:24.200]   when it, you know, it started in Windows 8, came to Windows 10. And its sort of mission statement
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:30.680]   was to be the place where you bought stuff that was guaranteed to be safe. It was running in a
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:38.760]   sandbox and, you know, and couldn't break out of that sandbox. And therefore couldn't have malware
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:47.320]   and it couldn't be a Trojan of any kind. What this week's announcement said was the new store,
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:54.920]   which is also coming to Windows 10, is going to be able to deliver conventional Win32 apps and
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:04.040]   not just the kind that are repackaged using MSI X, but that are, you know, just full trust,
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   Win32 apps, you go to somebody's website and you click on their link and the store pops up in a
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:17.960]   little tiny window and downloads the thing and installs it with whatever switches that you have
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:24.680]   for it. So, so it's an installer as well as a store, really. It's an installer as well as a store.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:31.960]   Now the reason, you know, what they're doing to provide the security there is you're saying it
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:39.400]   has to be admitted into the store. And once it's, you know, and has, and just like with any store,
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.920]   Microsoft's or Apples or Googles, it has to be inspected, it has to pass inspection and be vetted
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:52.920]   and be, you know, you're safe. And then, and then there's a hash that's assigned to that app and
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:19:00.760]   and you can't change that. You can host the app on your own server if you want it. You don't
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.480]   have to upload it to Microsoft servers. It doesn't have to be downloaded from there, but the hash
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.840]   has to match. If you make even, you know, you change even one byte in that it will no longer
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:16.760]   download, it will no longer install from the store using your location. So that's their,
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:24.520]   that's their way of maintaining the promise of security for a conventional Win32 app that's
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.560]   downloaded from the store. So that there does seem to be a little bit of a mismatch between the
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:35.960]   promise of security and the demand for a TPM module on to install Windows 11 and then
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.480]   opening up in so many new ways and different ways. And even Android apps, you got to wonder,
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.760]   I mean, what is the security model going to look like with Android apps running on this?
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.200]   Let's talk about compatibility because this was the biggest upset for people.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.920]   I think, you know, a lot of, I thought the biggest upset would be they put the start menu in the
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.600]   middle. I thought that was going to be, I'm going to hear about that all day. Apparently,
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.200]   nobody cared about that. And I actually, aesthetically, I think Windows 11 looks very nice.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.440]   But there was a lot of upset about, I think a lot of people wanted to run it and we're upset,
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.360]   they won't be able to even on some late model PCs. And what is the,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.880]   first of all, this is a moving target. Microsoft has changed the requirements a couple of times
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:30.040]   since this event. What is the current status? You need a TPM 2.0 chip to run Windows 11?
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:37.000]   So it's not a TPM 2.0 chip. You can have it in software too, right?
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.480]   There's a lot of confusion about it. Well, pretty much every Intel CPU that's been released since
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:51.320]   2015 has TPM functionality, trusted platform module functionality.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.600]   You didn't need a separate chip for this. It could be part of it. Built into the CPU. You
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.320]   don't need it previously. You needed to have a separate chip on the motherboard.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:06.840]   And it's analogous to the Mac's secure enclave kind of thing. But it's basically,
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.240]   it's a place where cryptographic keys can be stored and they can't be tampered with.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:20.360]   And you can use that to do integrity checks, some very serious integrity checks, especially
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:28.520]   at crucial times like startup to ensure that something isn't injected into the operating system
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:36.680]   there. But so the TPM requirement though, isn't the big deal because most even six-year-old hardware
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:42.040]   has a TPM. Well, okay, you say that. And I've said that, but I hear from people who say I have
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:49.720]   an AMD chip, a self-built computer. It doesn't, you know, and there is a compatibility with
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.920]   checker which Microsoft offers, which has a whole lot of people on there. There's two things going
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:05.240]   on there. One is that until 2018, there was no requirement that the TPM had to be enabled. So
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:12.040]   a lot of vendors shipped PCs without the TPM being enabled. But you could turn it on.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.520]   But you could, but you could turn it on. In the device manager. Yeah.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:22.920]   In the BIOS. The BIOS is where you turn it on. You have to go into the UEFI firmware.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:28.280]   It has to be a UEFI. So if you have an old-fashioned BIOS, forget it. It's not going to run Windows
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:35.160]   11. You need a UEFI system. It has to have secure boot and it has to have TPM 2.0 functionality in
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:43.400]   it. Now for a lot of home-built PCs and a lot of gamer PCs, those might have had the TPM
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   functionality built into the CPU. But the companies that released those motherboards never bothered
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:58.440]   to put the TPM switch into the firmware. And so those are the people who they technically,
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:07.080]   if their motherboard manufacturer released a new firmware update that allowed them to turn on
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:16.920]   the TPM functionality, they'd be golden. But what's the odds that a motherboard from 2017 or 2018 is
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:22.440]   suddenly going to get a firmware update after going four years since the last one it had.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:30.840]   So that's problem number one. But it's a TPM. But the much, much, much bigger problem is that
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:41.640]   Microsoft put a hard floor on CPU compatibility. And basically anything, it's 8th generation
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:52.840]   Intel CPUs and they're equivalent on AMD and ARM manufactured. Most ARM chips are going to
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:59.800]   that you're going to see in a PC will qualify because that's a relatively new thing. But even
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:06.840]   some 8th generation Intel chips won't qualify because it's KB Lake, right, is an 8th generation,
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:15.640]   but there's some KB Lake chips. It's only KB Lake revision R and later that are going to be supported
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:22.760]   on Windows 11. So the official word for Microsoft, this is in the documentation, is that most PCs
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:30.920]   that were designed and built in the last 18 to 24 months will qualify for Windows 11. Before that,
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:38.120]   maybe, maybe not. For those people, they can continue to run Windows 10 and it will get updated
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:45.080]   through 2025. That's the end of life at least through 2025. So they at least means what Microsoft
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:54.760]   might extend that? I would bet I would say that it's at least a 50 50 bet that Microsoft will extend
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:03.160]   Windows 10's support for at least a year or two past October 2025. There's no reason not to.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:09.160]   Because there's going to, in fact, if you go back to the 8th generation
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:20.120]   8th generation Intel CPUs, those came out in PCs in 2018. The Microsoft's general promises
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:26.120]   10-year lifecycle for an operating system. So it would make sense for them to try and extend it
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   to 2027, 2028. So mostly people are just saying, "Oh, this is funny. I'm going to, a new conspiracy
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.840]   theory." Microsoft did this because they wanted people to say, "I really want Windows 11 and I
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:45.480]   can't get it." They like that. That is a good drumbeat because otherwise it would have been
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.240]   people saying, "I don't want Windows 11. That's disgusting. I'm staying with Windows 10," which is
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.880]   what most people usually say when there's a new version of Windows.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:57.720]   The mystery here is that the processors, as Ed pointed out with the Kibilay car...
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.680]   Why wouldn't they 11?
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:06.120]   We don't know yet the reasoning. I think we're all open to, "Okay, Microsoft, give us the argument
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.800]   why." What's the technical argument?
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.640]   Right. So far they haven't presented it. There's been one of some from Microsoft that said it's
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:19.800]   not security-related. There was this concern maybe it has to do with some of the hardware flaws.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.840]   It's not security-related. It's not just security-related.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:29.000]   They said performance, which was weird because...
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.200]   Because an i7-700 is pretty fast.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.600]   And it's still faster than some of the...
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.760]   Fascinating Adam or a Solaron, yeah.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.080]   Right. So there's no rhyme or reason here in terms of the performance.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.600]   And the question I have is, with the leaked build, you can throw it on a USB
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:51.800]   disk and use a Microsoft creation tool. You can install it on anything that runs Windows.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.200]   You can put it on a Surface Go, Surface Studio 2. So these are all the PCs that technically do not
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.520]   qualify for Windows 11. It runs perfectly fine on there. No issues whatsoever.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.000]   So it's not like it can't physically run it. It can. They're just arbitrarily saying,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.480]   "We don't want it on these chips." And we're all waiting for another shoot of fall.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.040]   I don't think they're going to stick to this. At least the TPM stuff, I'm totally on board,
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.200]   but I think that's... You got to have some argument here for security. And I think that's...
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.840]   They need to have sort of a break. But the processors up there are going to have to do a
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:29.080]   little bit better of a job. I could see blocking lower end chips maybe. If you have a core i7-7
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.120]   gen, I mean, come on. It is getting a little weird.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.440]   That's pretty recent. This kind of lends some credence to the argument.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:43.160]   Paul and Mary Joeb last week before Windows 11 was announced said, "Why are they doing Windows 11?"
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:49.080]   And they said to juke the PC market because it had an incredible year last year because of COVID.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.040]   But of course, it's probably going to have a terrible year as a result this year. And they
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:00.760]   wanted to sell PCs. And so this really is for OEMs because historically people buy new PCs to
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:07.480]   get the new version of Windows. That would be a good reason. But I don't think Microsoft would
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.120]   ever admit to that. Do you think that's the reason? So the sales prediction, I've actually
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.000]   been surprised that sales of laptops haven't fallen off a cliff yet. But the actual predictions
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.560]   is going to be up 18% over the next 20. So they're still buying it. And so I think the philosophy...
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.000]   Who's buying them and why? Because I could see how they bought it to run Zoom because the kids
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.240]   have to go to class. And I'm working at home and I needed a new PC last year. But that would sound
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:39.400]   like... They don't have a reason this year. Why? I think it's the permanent change that the pandemic
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.560]   has caused in the workplace. These are the residual effects of it. So while some people are definitely
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:49.880]   going back to the office, Microsoft and Nadella has talked about this. This digital transformation
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.040]   has been... He's accelerated by five years just because of the pandemic. So we were already going
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:59.400]   down this route. But it happened so quickly. So basically they're betting on... And the market
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:06.360]   seems to say that the laptop or the PC is still going to be the hub of all computing going forward.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:13.240]   And the thing about Windows 11, it is to juke the market and to drive some more sales.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:19.160]   But it will also open up some new hardware opportunities. This idea of two and ones with dual screens.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:25.400]   We already saw they have a new pen that supports haptic feedback. The current pen doesn't support it.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.560]   We know there's wake on touch. We touch the display and it wakes up. So they're going to be doing a lot
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.520]   more with the hardware, which Windows 11 is... And then there's a smaller stuff that no one talks about.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:41.320]   Windows 11, the updates are 40% smaller and it reboots much quicker. And it's going to be able to
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.520]   refer from our sourcing that it'll be able to give you an estimate about how long the updates
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   are going to actually take and it does it all in the background. Much more like how a smartphone
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:54.120]   works. So there's a lot more in these under the hood changes that are coming that this is going
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.440]   to allow to go forward. But there's still a lot here we don't know. And I can tell you there's
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.200]   still features that haven't been announced that will be coming out with this operating system.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:08.600]   Yeah, of course. Although... That sounds a lot like how Chrome updates too.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:16.520]   And Leo bringing up schools makes me think about what Microsoft's strategy is there because
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.760]   Google and Chrome have that market pretty much locked up. Absolutely.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:27.560]   So 10x was their answer to that. And then they canceled 10x, which left us all wondering like,
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:34.200]   that was your plan for Chromebooks. And now it seems like it took a lot of what was in 10x
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.600]   emerged it into Windows 11. Now 10x was going to be a complete break. They were going to continue
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.880]   with Windows 10, but it was only going to be sold on new devices. Windows 11 is really a
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:49.400]   hybrid strategy here. You're still going to need sometimes new hardware to run it. Not all the time,
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:54.680]   but as we're just discussed some of the time. And they are making somewhat of a hard break,
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:00.120]   but it also brings over a lot of the stuff from 10x and 10 into one. I don't know the story behind
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.760]   that. I would love to know and I'm sure we'll find out. Sure. I'd do some reporting on this about
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:11.480]   what the transition, what was that discussion by that happened. But the school, I mean Chromebooks
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:16.840]   dominate in the US for schools. You know, I'll have to wait and see how Windows 11 plays into that.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:22.040]   But it is a lighter operating system technically, but I'm not sure it competes completely with
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.720]   Chrome OS yet. I'm kind of surprised to hear PC sales are going to be up this year. I'm going to
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:33.080]   have to retract my long standing statement that the desktop is dead because it sounds like the
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.200]   desktop is not only not dead, it's quite alive and well, which surprises me a little bit.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:44.680]   We are seeing both Apple and Microsoft make their desktop operating systems more like mobile operating
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:52.120]   systems in a Microsoft's case, even it's actually both cases install phone apps on your desktop.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.720]   But the desktop seems like it's alive and well. Is that a surprise?
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:01.400]   Doesn't surprise me. It surprises me. I thought this was this nobody.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.000]   So here's the everything was going home.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.640]   So the phrase they kept using at the launch event this week was hybrid work.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:17.000]   And so a lot of people who were forced home for the pandemic,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:27.160]   just dragged out. I heard from a lot of people who just dragged out whatever old PC they had,
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:33.240]   and they made do with it. Because they thought it was temporary.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.640]   Because they thought it was temporary. And now they see,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:45.560]   okay, I'm going to be spending a lot more time at home and in the office and in other places
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.760]   and such. And so I need to replace this piece of crap that I thought I was just going to need
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:59.400]   for a little while with something more useful. And that explains, I think that explains the
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:09.640]   success of the M1 Max, which have tremendous battery life and their lightweight and impressively
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:17.720]   fast. And if people who had like a seven year old Mac are feeling like, oh, okay, this is a worthy
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.680]   upgrade and I'll do this. People who are in the Windows world, I think are in a very similar
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:30.600]   situation. If they've got a six or seven year old PC, the compatibility questions here
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.960]   sort of accelerate the upgrade decision for some of them.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:41.480]   And it now seems that people will probably wait until, I don't know,
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.640]   Microsoft said holiday 2021 to buy a new PC with Windows 11 on it, right?
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.280]   Or I guess you know, if I won today an upgrade.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:55.880]   Yeah, right. They're doing, yeah, they're doing the compatibility thing, which has a
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:03.240]   checker history at Microsoft. But you know, but basically any new PC that you buy today,
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.680]   except for the Surface Studio 2, should run Windows 11.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.680]   I love it except for the Surface Studio 2.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:15.480]   Yeah, I mean, that's why I can't imagine it.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.200]   They'll stick with this.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:23.080]   The other thing I'm curious what our Windows experts think about is office and its role
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:28.280]   sort of going forward and harkening back to the fact that if kids are growing up on Chrome
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:34.120]   and used to using every, all of Google's products in the cloud, you know, maybe office
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.040]   becomes less and less relevant and this is a edge against that.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.240]   It's pretty cloudy now.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.520]   Office by default seems to one drive.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:48.200]   Right. But is it something that young people use as they grow up and get used to?
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.640]   Right. I always feel terrible when high schools require kids to do presentations and power point.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.520]   I feel like you poor child.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:03.080]   You know, they use Google Slides too. I mean, it's the point is to do a slideshow.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.960]   They don't care. You know, they want you to use whatever the school software is and it's most
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.560]   often some sort of Google product.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.920]   No, it's a really good point. I mean, I hear this all the time that, you know, with schools
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.960]   relying on Google that you have a generation growing up is using Google products.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.600]   There is a tension because when you go into the workforce, that doesn't seem to be the case.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:29.800]   You still have a lot of enterprise and fortune 500 companies all using office,
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.760]   which means where's that tension go, right? Do the students have to convert or is there going
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.640]   to be the companies that convert? It's not like office has turned into a bad product or it has
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:45.080]   any negatives to it. In fact, office is still doing extremely well. Subscriptions are always
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.960]   up every year. But I don't know how that tension gets resolved because it's true. And I think that's
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.880]   one reason why Microsoft definitely wants to, you know, have a more aggressive approach in the
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.360]   schools and they're trying to find an answer. How Windows 11 plays into that? I think we may
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.480]   need to be seeing it. Microsoft hasn't sold us that story yet.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:14.680]   One fascinating thing about Office 365 today is that you can use it without ever installing
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:23.240]   the desktop apps. You can treat it and it is the experience is like a, you know,
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:30.120]   through the looking glass bizarro world version of Google Docs. Instead of G Drive, you've got
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:38.280]   OneDrive instead of Google Docs. You've got Word Online and you've got Excel Online and even
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:45.480]   PowerPoint Online and Outlook instead of Gmail. And you can do the entire thing in a browser
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:53.800]   without ever touching a desktop app, without ever having to manage a file in file explorer or in
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:37:02.600]   Finder, you know, whichever you can just. And I mean, that to me seems like it's ultimately the answer
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:09.640]   to the question that you posed, Leo, or Denise, is, you know, how do the folks,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:18.120]   the kids who are growing up with living in the cloud and working on school assignments in the
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   cloud, how do they transition into the workforce? Well, if the workforce allows them to continue
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:31.640]   working in the cloud and, you know, the menus look pretty much the same and the editing surface
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:36.200]   looks pretty much the same and all you have to do is learn a few slight differences. But everything,
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.160]   I just open a browser and I click on my saved shortcut and boom, there I am,
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:47.800]   editing a document and working on a spreadsheet and such, then there shouldn't be a transition.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:48.440]   Really?
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:56.600]   They are starting to ship to some versions of Windows. I've actually had a couple laptops
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:02.120]   new at a box experience where the office suite is installed, but as PWA apps.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.080]   Oh, interesting.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.840]   Oh, yeah, just as Edward was saying.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.360]   So they're basically the web apps.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.400]   They're the web apps.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.120]   Yes. Yeah.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:14.920]   And that's why Outlook is going. Outlook is an excellent PWA right now. You can run it.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.080]   In fact, they just released an extension, which is brilliant. This is a small little thing that's
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.560]   so good. They released an extension for Edge that connects to your Outlook. So you don't need
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.880]   to leave the tab here and you just click to tab and it drops down a little mobile view of your
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.800]   inbox and you could read your email. And so they're doing a lot of this. But yeah, that's right.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:36.360]   I mean, PWA, Microsoft's all on board with it. And this idea of like web versions of
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.440]   Office is it's already here. You can do this all right now. And it is pretty good. Although,
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.240]   there's no dark mode yet. So I'm waiting for the dark mode.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.680]   But I'm sure it's a dramatic tip.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:49.320]   I'll explain for those who are saying, what are they talking about? Progressive web apps or PWA apps
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:57.400]   are websites that can become static with the help of service workers in your browser and live on your
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:03.960]   desktop, operate offline, connect when necessary, but don't have to connect to run. It's kind of a
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:10.200]   hybrid app model. And it's something Google invented. Microsoft and Google have been very
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:16.680]   fourth very promoting it. Apple has been somewhat suspect about it.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.560]   Right. And it's kind of a kind of a model.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.840]   It's kind of abandoned.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.400]   And that's what's really surprising. Firefox, it abandoned all support for PWAs.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:30.920]   But people have been using, you know, web apps ever since Gmail. So I think they're very
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:36.120]   comfortable with the idea of opening up a browser. And that that is the interface to all of their
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:39.560]   apps. I think they're very comfortable with that as long as it works and it can work offline.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:47.240]   Why not? There's still a lock in component that has to you with your where your data lives.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.880]   So and or has lived for all of your life.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.800]   Well, we're clearly moving towards that data in the cloud model, right?
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:40:01.400]   Both Apple and Microsoft default to their own clouds for storage on both Windows and Mac OS.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:06.600]   Many of your folders don't live on your desktop. They seem to be on your desktop,
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:12.040]   but they're really on the cloud one driver. I drive. That's a little weird.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.480]   Right. I don't like it.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.960]   But I'm like, I don't like them at all.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.720]   That's why I thought the desktop was dying because it was just old-fashioned,
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.720]   but I guess a whole new generation has discovered the desktop. But as we can see,
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.360]   it isn't the desktop. I know it's a hybrid thing.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.120]   Yeah. I guess we'll figure this out a long time ago.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:30.920]   Right. Right.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:37.640]   Yeah. But maybe other formats need to make data more portable as well.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.040]   Email has been very influential in this, I suspect.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:48.600]   There was sort of a hidden part of the announcement this week is that Teams and chat
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:54.520]   is going to be integrated into, I think it's integrated into the taskbar, isn't it, Daniel?
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.640]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.120]   But weirdly is not pre-installed as far as I could tell. You still have to download it.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.400]   Is that right? That's what Paul was saying about.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.360]   I think it's, I think it's, I think it's used will be pre-installed.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.560]   It will be pre-installed.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:14.200]   Yeah. Yeah. But here's the, but here's, here's why that's relevant to this discussion is Teams,
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:21.080]   especially in education, it wants to be the hub for all those-
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.640]   It's becoming a platform more and more.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.800]   It's becoming a platform. And guess what? If you go to Teams,
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.480]   you get to, again, to address Denise's point here, if you go to Teams, you can add,
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:38.040]   of course, one drive is already there, but you can add Google Drive to it.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:45.000]   You can add Dropbox and you can add Box. And any other cloud provider can, if they,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:54.520]   all they have to do is use the APIs, they can add their cloud storage into Teams and thus
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:42:02.520]   into Office 365 as well. And you can integrate into the ribbons and such so that you can
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:11.000]   share files and co-edit files, even if you're not in OneDrive, even if you're in Dropbox or
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.480]   Box. That's something that I don't think Google has done and I don't think Google would do.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:27.240]   And it's in Microsoft's DNA to do that. And it'll be interesting to see whether that
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.800]   becomes a competitive strength.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   So when I look at Teams integrated into Windows 11, it really looks like a phone app.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.280]   And I think that this is in response to the fact that people do a lot of their communication now
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   in the messaging apps on their phone. That's what this looks like.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:54.360]   And so this is to me part of the phoneification of the desktop or the mobile integrating into the
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:03.000]   desktop. We thought at first that this would be like the whole thing would be Teams centric.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.360]   Teams is turning into an operating system of its own, but I guess it's just Teams integrated into
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:17.000]   Windows 11. October, free upgrade for Windows 10 users as long as your computer's
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.800]   compatible. There is a compatibility checker, which, as you pointed out, has changed silently
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:28.200]   since it first released. So tell you whether your hardware can run it.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:34.840]   It's actually, I should point out there's a free app on GitHub we just wrote about on
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:41.960]   yesterday called, "Why not win 11?" It's called its open source. And it's a much more
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:48.760]   detailed app that you could run that will delineate the reasons why your PC doesn't qualify.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.320]   So it's not just the CPU, it goes into the architecture, the cores, the generation,
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:58.360]   the TPM. It does all that. It has 11 categories and it'll check each one of them.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:03.800]   It's a much better half, of course, than Microsoft, which is just, you know, typical Microsoft in this
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:11.400]   case. From Robert C. Mail, who says, "Why not win 11 is not controlled by me? If you're the owner,
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:17.400]   please contact GitHub." Okay, so no, no, no, no. Is this the wrong one? No, he's saying that the
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:23.960]   website, "Why not win 11?" Oh, he wants that website. Right now it's on GitHub,
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:29.160]   under one. That makes a lot more sense. Okay, got it. This looks great. Yeah, Microsoft's
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:35.480]   compatibility checker is singularly non-communicative. It didn't even create a log file for heaven's
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:44.920]   sake, which is, I mean, and that's something that every, as part of the check, it's doing all that
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:49.800]   stuff. All it has to do is dump the output into a log file and put it in a well-known place,
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:55.480]   and then you can open a text file at the end and they didn't even do that. It's just,
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:05.240]   there's something about this whole week strikes me as just strange because they didn't have
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:11.400]   their compatibility story ready to go. There should have been a white paper that explained
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:21.320]   in Microsoft BS terms, why they're doing these things. You have all of their fluffy language on it,
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.640]   but they should at least have had a white paper ready to go that says, "Here's why we're
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:31.400]   insisting on a minimum CPU generation because it will do this, that and the other thing, and
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   you're going to have the greatest experience and the most compatible and reliable." But they didn't,
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:40.200]   they didn't even have that ready, and now they're scrambling to get this thing ready and publish it
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:46.920]   next week. But, you know, the users are already standing at the gates with the pitchforks and the
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.520]   torches and not necessarily ready to read the white paper. You're going to burn it.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:57.000]   Like I said, I think Microsoft, in some way, likes this. It's much better to have people saying,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.960]   "Why can't I get Windows 11 instead of I really don't want Windows 11?"
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:07.560]   It was a big change. Yeah, probably last week it was, it's just a stupid skin. It just
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:12.520]   redid the star review. Why don't call Windows 10.1? And now everybody's like, "Wait, you know,
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:19.880]   I can't get this." I want it. Kind of funny. Is this a consumer version of Windows 11? This is
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:26.280]   for all Windows users eventually, but businesses are notorious, slow to adopt, especially when
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.080]   there's a cosmetic change, because that means retraining people.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:34.600]   Sure. Yeah, the general release we're expecting October, maybe even October 6,
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   but that's data flexible. But that's going to be the, for the seekers. So if your computer
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:47.400]   qualifies and you go check and you can then click and download and install it, that will continue
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:52.440]   through 2022, at which point it becomes an automatic update. And you can, we've told,
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.480]   still can defer. Like, if you don't want to go to Windows 11, you don't want to go to Windows 11.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.880]   That's probably not the problem.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:03.720]   Didn't he say, "No, you're not a big Windows user." I'm sorry. Sorry, we had to spend the first half
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.760]   hour talking about this.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.400]   It's actually super interesting to me, because I think in today's day and age, we're sort of an
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:16.280]   everything user. We have PCs in the house and I'm on a Mac right now and I've got an Amazon tablet
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.880]   and it's everything.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.240]   That's really true.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:24.200]   And I think that's kind of what Sachin Adela is saying. It's interesting, at the end of his
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.840]   talk, by the way, I liked it that they started with Panos Panet, who seemed a little down,
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.600]   but I think he was just trying to be sincere.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:36.440]   Adela came on afterwards instead of kicking things off, which I thought worked very well,
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.280]   to kind of put a button on it and really talk about a strategy.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:48.200]   And I think also to kind of rub my apples' nose in the fact that Windows is open
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:56.120]   and supports agency and is not going to close down. He also quoted Shopanauer, which is a little weird
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:02.360]   at the end. He didn't mention him by name, but he said, "I am reminded of analogy from a 19th
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:08.200]   century philosopher who compared creators to objects in our solar system. He wrote about meteors
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:13.000]   that flash but fade away planets that burned longer but whose energy is confined to their own
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.720]   orbit and compared them to stars that are constant and light the path of their own."
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:25.000]   He says, "We want Windows to be a star, a permanent constant light on the path."
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.080]   That's interesting. And I don't know if that's something new from Nadella,
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:36.600]   but it is much more Windows-centric than his previous statements.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.440]   It won't be time where people were...
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:47.400]   Since he's veg-free into the heavens and invoking science fiction principles,
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   I thought you guys should know in case you're not watching the IRC that Reverb Mike and PS
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.480]   Chops think that William Gibson should call his next novel, "Why Not Win 11?"
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:03.960]   Somehow I doubt that will happen. Daniel, what were you going to say?
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:10.280]   Just that a couple of years ago, people were calling for Nadella to kill Xbox, to kill surface,
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:15.960]   to kill Windows. This idea that Azure is everything, they're just going to turn to basically an IBM
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:21.400]   kind of company. This is a doubling down. They've doubled down on Xbox, which paid it off.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.320]   They put the right people... I would say the real change is they put the right people in charge
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.640]   of this. Phil Spencer doing Xbox, he's doing a tremendous job. They spent a lot of money,
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:38.840]   the second biggest acquisition of all on a gaming company. They're clearly all in on Xbox,
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.080]   they're all on gaming. They're all on Windows.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.440]   Surface is still there.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:47.880]   And you got now the guy in charge of Surface and charge of Windows. He's really passionate,
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:52.760]   panosic, and good at passionate about it. We're all very excited about seeing what he's done with
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:57.400]   Windows. This is his first year. This is what he's done in the first year of him taking over
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:01.800]   Windows. It's pretty impressive. They're back, I would say, with all this stuff.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.960]   It's really interesting. It's counter what I thought Microsoft was going to do is move
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:12.200]   Windows to the cloud, solve the security issues by basically managed Windows.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:17.000]   And I guess I was wrong on that. I really thought that was the future for Microsoft.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.920]   I think it's still there. It's just but it's a couple of years out, I would say.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:26.680]   To the point of juicing the PC sales, gaming's not going anywhere but up.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   And you're not playing games without a PC.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:33.880]   Well, that's what's also interesting. You can now play Xbox games on your PC.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:39.000]   Thanks to X Cloud, you can play Xbox games anywhere, really.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.800]   So you would think they'd be promoting the console, and I guess they are, but because it's
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:49.320]   hard to get the console, they're also saying, "Look, you could still play it in other places."
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.600]   And there are people who prefer to play on PCs.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:57.320]   And there was one new feature. I'm not a gamer, so I didn't pay as much attention as I should
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:03.400]   have to that part of it. But I recall there's one new feature that's going to allow you to
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:08.760]   run objects directly from NVMe of the Android.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:13.320]   Oh, yeah. That direct media access is something that's in the Xbox.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:17.560]   What is it called? Direct memory? Direct storage. Direct storage.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:23.640]   Direct storage, yeah. That's the one. And that will require a new PC, and that should be a huge
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:31.400]   performance bump for exactly the kind of scenarios that gamers love.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:38.280]   And there's no reason that that technology wouldn't translate to things like graphics workstations
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:51.560]   and CAD drafting apps and stuff like that. So it's a consumer release this October.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:59.560]   And so obviously gaming is the place to focus that there. But that was an interesting architectural
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:10.280]   change that you definitely will need new hardware for and some definitely new hardware.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:15.960]   Daniel, what's the technical explanation for direct storage? It requires a fast SSD
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:23.720]   like an NVMe drive. But what is it doing? Is it just loading things faster? What is it doing?
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.840]   I believe that it's bypassing parts of the CPU and going direct to the memory.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:35.160]   And it's allowed to hold it persistent. So you see this on the new Xbox Series X and Series S,
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:41.400]   I believe, where you can basically put a game into the background, go do something else,
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:45.800]   come back to the game, and it doesn't need to reload the game. It just pops back in and you're
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.600]   right where you left off. So it's just a sort of persistent behavior. Almost like what we saw
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:55.560]   with tombstoneing and smartphones, you can think of it as that way. But it's on a much bigger scale
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:01.400]   for GPU intensive apps. And so that's right. I mean, this is in terms of gaming, you can just
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:06.040]   minimize your game out of the way, go back to Word, continue. And then when you launch it again,
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.520]   it's just you don't need to reload the game. You won't see the menu pop up. It'll just be right
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:16.840]   there with game again. So this does have ramifications for heavy lifting apps like CAD and for work
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.480]   stations where all this is going to play a major role. Sam Escovitch writing in ours Technica
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:26.760]   also says it'll change the way games are developed because right now when you're writing a game,
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:33.000]   you have to allow for slow load times in between big loads. And so you have kind of elements of
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.400]   the game where nothing much is happening as you're moving from one world to the other,
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:42.840]   those can open up suddenly. And that's going to change how game developers write their games.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:50.440]   So that's interesting as well. Yeah, I feel like Microsoft is firing on all cylinders at this point,
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:56.840]   that this was despite the miscommunications. Yeah, despite the miscommunications,
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:03.640]   they really have the technology anyway seems to be well on track and right on for what people
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:09.560]   are looking for. Is that right? Would you say in the philosophy to yeah, you agree, Ed?
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:18.200]   Absolutely. I do think they they really need to get their communication strategy
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:26.920]   figured out though. Because a lot of the good stuff that they're doing is just completely
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:31.240]   getting lost because they're having they're going to have to be spending all their time
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:38.440]   explaining what they meant. And anytime you're explaining, you're losing. Yeah, well, and there
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:44.200]   yeah, there's a lot of back pedaling and re re explaining and no, let's get this right. But
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:49.960]   that's historically going back to the announcement that you couldn't use Xbox in a submarine. That's
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:56.760]   historically been a problem for Microsoft or Jerry Nixon saying this is the last version of Windows.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:05.000]   I don't know what the problem is. Maybe bring back who was it? Burston Marceller? Who was the
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.360]   no, no, I want to say Warby Parker. No, no, it was who was their who was their PR famous PR company
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:16.400]   for many, many years. Come on, Ed, you spent a week wanker. It's
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:21.320]   trying to get your head strum. Yes, there's still there. There's still there. I get still doing it.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:28.120]   Oh, yeah. It's called we now. Oh, yeah, there we go. It's w we we were there. We were worldwide.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:35.400]   Now we worldwide. Yeah. Okay. Just a close out. I would say the other half of this is going to be
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:39.480]   coming in October. Obviously, when those 11 is going to be starting to come out then, but
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.840]   I fully expect a big surface events in October where they're going to fill in the other half here
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:51.480]   with the new hardware. So I really expect a new Surface Pro 8, like a real new Surface Pro 8,
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:58.120]   thinner bezels, pen and the keyboard, but also reflecting some of the newer technologies that
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:04.760]   are becoming with Windows 11 Surface Studio 3 possibly Surface Duo version 2 definitely.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:09.880]   So this is coming to you. I think the other part to watch and of course, their partners HP,
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:15.720]   Dell Lenovo especially, will have all new hardware to sort of, you know, match what's coming with
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.880]   Windows 11. I think that's going to be the other exciting part to watch later this year.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:27.960]   In October, get ready. I want to take a little break. We'll come back. We have lots more besides
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:34.120]   Windows to talk about, but I, you know, thought this was a pretty important announcement and I
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:40.840]   guess, I guess it, I guess it is. I'm looking forward to trying Windows 11. I turned on my insider
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:49.960]   build on my PC at home last night. To, is it the, which of the three levels of insider will I need?
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:56.200]   Dev channel. Oh, I turned on just the, the slowest one. So you need faster.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:03.720]   Release preview isn't going to get you anything. Yeah. Windows 11 related. Beta channel isn't going
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:11.800]   to get you anything. Windows 11 related until it's. July almost. Wow. July, August until it's
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:19.080]   almost feature complete. Okay. So you got to get the fast ring, the dev channel. And then it will be
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:24.440]   in, and it will be incomplete. Right. The, the builds that are released this coming week will be
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:28.440]   incomplete. Probably very much like the leaked one. Like the leaked ones. Okay. Yeah.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:36.760]   All right. It's great to have you Ed bot from the Ed bot report on zdnet got the experts here
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:45.000]   from windows central Daniel Rubino and the chorus, the Creek chorus Denise Howell from Denise Howell
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.240]   time info. We'll have lots more to talk about non windows stuff as well. Just a little bit.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:58.200]   Does your son use a Chromebook at school? Denise? Yes. But that is, that is the school issued item
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:02.840]   and sometimes testing is required on it, you know, in virtual settings for sure.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:10.600]   But his, his computer of choice at home is a PC. Yeah. We had the same thing where the, the school
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:14.760]   issued computer you had to take tests on, but nobody wanted to use it because it was so crappy.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:22.840]   So, you know, Michael has a choice of Chromebooks, obviously he can use and preferred, I think,
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:29.480]   to use a Mac actually for most of his school work at home. In school, will he be in school in the fall?
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.240]   Yes. I think like in classroom and school.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:38.680]   I'll have to be exciting. I bet he's really relieved to hear that. He had the choice. He,
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:45.800]   he chose to attend an all virtual school that his district instituted at the beginning of the
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:51.240]   last school year and that worked out really well for him, surprisingly to us all. But he's
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.760]   going to be a senior in high school and he very much is looking forward to that
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:59:01.880]   social senior experience back at school. Poor Michael, he had been doing one-on-one schools
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:06.040]   and was going to go to the public school for his senior year, which was his past year.
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:12.200]   So he could have that social experience and then COVID and he at least he got to walk. He got to
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.320]   walk with a mask on, but he got to walk and that was a, that was a good thing. Yeah. And I presume
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:23.160]   college will have in-person classes, I hope so. They're debating that still, believe it or not.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:28.360]   Our show today brought to you by brand new sponsor, Wanna Welcome and Dava?
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:36.280]   And Dava, E-N-D-A-V-A. They've got a great podcast. Effect season two is just launched
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:43.320]   of tech reimagined. It brings together some of the biggest, most interesting people in tech
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:50.760]   with industry experts like Guy Kawasaki, Mary Williams, Alex Hunter, Brian McBride, Tom Gruber,
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:58.040]   Dave Coplin, Inma Martinez, Viola Llewellyn. It's the big questions around technology and its
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:02.360]   industry. Guests and hosts will be talking about how these trends impact our everyday lives
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:09.560]   and how our relationship with technology is constantly reimagined. Hence the name tech reimagined.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:17.080]   The first episode's insurance reimagined, parts one and two included Ann Northlitt and Kevin Crawford
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:23.720]   discussing the role IT plays in the insurance industry. AI reimagined, these two episodes,
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:30.200]   the role of AI reimagined, featured Boris Sergal and Radu Orgadon talking about the
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:35.800]   regulations, accountability and expectations that arise when using AI to solve complex problems
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:42.120]   and discuss what the future holds for this technology and for those of us who use it on a daily basis.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:47.800]   If you're interested in shopping, I love this. This show has everything. Parts one and two of
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.600]   our shopping experience reimagined. The guests Thomas Beechin and Jeremy Mayes
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.400]   dive into some of the most significant shifts they've seen in consumer behavior over the last 12
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.480]   months, including the increasing popularity of direct to consumer and buy online pickup in store
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.800]   and how the shift to digital is pushing people and companies to reimagine the way we shop.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.200]   And Dava, that's really their business too. They've been reimagining the relationship between
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:18.360]   technology and people with a look at the most recent experiences with technology and its experts.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:23.160]   Learn more about how tech is becoming so much more in this world that is constantly growing
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.200]   and changing. It's a podcast you don't want to miss an end-ava podcast. You can subscribe and
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:34.920]   listen to Tech reimagined. The podcast from Endava, of course, wherever you get your podcasts.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:43.240]   And thank you Endava for your support for our show for this week in tech. A reminder, we do have
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:51.000]   not only the IRC, we've always had that at IRC.Twit.tv. Some great comments during this conversation
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.840]   in the IRC. We also now have a Discord for members of Club Twit. Club Twit is how you can support
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:04.280]   our show yourself with a $7 month subscription. We figured we had to give you something for that
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:10.920]   seven bucks. So we have ad-free versions of all of our shows, which is really nice audio and video.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:14.600]   Bonus content on a Twit Plus feed, including a lot of the things that happen with foreign
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.800]   aftershows that never make it into the podcast. And then that member's only Discord, which is a
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:25.400]   really fun place to hang out. Each show has its own channel, but there's also conversations about
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:32.840]   books, travel, coding, comics, Linux. We even have a Linux show on Saturday afternoons
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:38.600]   in the Discord on the Discord stage. So if you want to join us in Club Twit and
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:45.320]   hang out in the Discord with us and the hosts, please do us a favor and join Club Twit.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.560]   More information at twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:57.800]   I don't know if there's anybody out there still using the Western Digital My Book Live.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.880]   Western Digital stopped making it in 2015. I know a lot of people, I think I had one back then,
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:09.320]   stopped updating it around that time. In 2018, a serious exploit was discovered
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:16.280]   that allowed arbitrary code to be run on the My Book Live. Western Digital didn't put out a patch,
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.920]   didn't fix it, and now three years later, it's being exploited apparently.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:31.400]   A malefactor, a bad actor, a hacker is using that exploit to wipe people's Western Digital My Book
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:39.400]   Live. If you noticed a factory reset performed in your device, you may also notice that all of your
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:45.720]   data is gone. As far as anybody can tell, there's no way to get it back. Western Digital says we're
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:51.240]   investigating, perhaps they'll issue a patch, but their advice to anybody who owns a Western Digital
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.560]   My Book Live right now is you might want to disconnect it from the internet.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:03.880]   Okay. Disconnect your My Book Live to prevent further attacks while we investigate.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.000]   I guess that goes to putting everything in the cloud, right?
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.080]   Oh, yes. These are people probably who said, "Oh, I don't trust the cloud. I'm going to have my own
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:19.400]   cloud here in my house." Yeah. When it really goes to, if you've got an IoT device, which is
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.720]   basically any hardware that goes on the internet in your house, you really want to make sure it's
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.240]   being supported and updated and that you're getting regular over-the-air updates.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:32.920]   Ideally, you shouldn't buy anything these days. It doesn't get regular over-the-air updates
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:38.120]   automatically because you don't want to just go around and have to update everything.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:43.720]   I feel bad. I've been saying this on the radio show for a long time, but I feel bad because
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.400]   most people who own this thought of it as their backup drive, right?
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:54.120]   And the problem is if it's the only place something exists, it ain't a backup. I don't care what you
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:00.920]   call it. It's the original. It's the only copy. And I certainly hope people have backups of their
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.280]   MyBookLive backup. But turning on automatic updates isn't going to help if they're not updating.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:11.480]   They're not updating. Yeah. So I guess even though you might have bought this only six years
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:19.240]   ago, it's probably time to replace it. I would guess. Probably want to get Windows 11 anyway.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.360]   Yeah. You wouldn't have gotten Windows 11 on your MyBookLive, so there.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.360]   Doesn't have direct storage. What did you want after all?
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.880]   I don't know. I think about things like the Samsung refrigerators that have their own operating
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.360]   system that gets updated about once every couple of years. I guess you're not storing a whole lot
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:42.200]   of data on your refrigerator. But if you bought a refrigerator that has a big screen and a browser,
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:47.080]   and by the way, this has happened to people who bought this refrigerator, the browser is no
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.280]   longer updated. It is unusable. You go on the internet. So what's that big screen for?
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.320]   You've got a big, nothing on your refrigerator.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   It's also a potential point of access to the rest of your network.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:03.800]   Good point.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:14.200]   It's a jumping off point. And some, that's where any, the really good hackers,
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:25.320]   the ones who want to get deep into networks, they love stuff like this because it gives you a toehold
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.720]   and a toehold in a place that's not maintained.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:39.400]   Well, who can forget the Vegas casino that was hacked via a fish tank thermometer?
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.400]   Exactly.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:46.520]   Remember this? A fish tank thermometer that apparently was online.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:54.200]   This happened back in 2018. The attackers used the thermometer to get a foothold in the network.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:07:00.040]   They then found the high roller database, pulled that back across the network out the thermostat
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:04.040]   and up into the cloud. It probably took a while to get it through the thermostat,
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.960]   but they are very patient.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.000]   And nobody seemed to notice. Apparently, this thermostat was connected to the internet,
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.120]   so you could see what temperature your tank was at, I guess.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.040]   Crazy.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.200]   Well, and control it because that's the whole point is turning up a dev.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.720]   You want, you don't want to have to send an employee in to do that all the time.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.640]   You can just keep an eye on it, monitor it.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:37.480]   And I mean, it's a perfectly good idea, but security is a process.
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:44.120]   You would think a casino would have actually somebody asked me this on the radio show today.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:49.000]   And I didn't really have a great answer, which is now that we know ransomware is a massive threat.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.680]   Why is it people are still getting bit by it? Why a colonial pipeline pay what was it?
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.960]   Several million dollars in ransomware.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.520]   Didn't they have backups? Weren't they prepared for this?
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.840]   It's not a backup.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.320]   Sorry.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:05.560]   Get it.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:05.960]   Affected.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.240]   In terms of backups themselves are being infected.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:14.680]   In the case of colonial pipeline, clearly IT was an up to the task or wasn't getting
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:21.480]   funded properly because I think we found out later that the way the bad guys got in
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:27.960]   was through a VPN account from a long, a employee who had left long ago, but the account was never
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:33.880]   discontinued. The employee hadn't used two factor and in fact reused the password.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.840]   And the password was leaked in a breach.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:40.600]   Hackers tried it on the VPN. It worked.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.840]   We're in in the famous movie hacker phrase.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.960]   I'm in and the rest is history.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.360]   I think it was even worse than that.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.800]   It was a VPN product.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.240]   And this happens a lot.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.240]   It was a VPN product that was installed.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:59.320]   And then they stopped using it, but they never.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.080]   They didn't even they weren't even using it.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.240]   The product anymore, but the server was still running.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.800]   Yeah, because that's.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.360]   Louise.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.560]   And that but but that's very, very, very common.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:16.680]   And basically these days, especially in critical infrastructure, you need to,
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.640]   you know, you basically need to assume you're you're already hacked.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.520]   And yeah, your job is right.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.200]   Is not is not to keep them out.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.720]   Your job is to find them.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.040]   Yes.
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.760]   And your job is to find all the places they could come in as.
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.800]   But I T and security are seen as cost centers.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:45.080]   And when something is a cost center and and profit, capitalism, etc.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.400]   Then, you know, the cost center, no, we're not going to give you another $100,000
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:56.600]   or another half a million dollars to hire to, you know, white hat, you know,
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.720]   would hire you.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.880]   You know, we're not going to fund your red team.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.120]   Right.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.360]   I guess that leaves it all left.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.080]   Leaves it all left to windows 11, right?
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:11.960]   They did say as they said year after year, the most secure version of windows ever.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   You'd think they'd be smart enough not to say that phrase, but people
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.560]   want a problem across this is the problem across industry, right?
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.200]   I mean, so we're just talking about TPM 2.0.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:25.720]   That plays a role in this, right?
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:25.720]   Sure.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.440]   It's idea of security, but it's a very unsexy argument.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.000]   If you're a consumer and you just want windows 11, you're like, I don't,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.480]   I've literally had people say, I don't care about that.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.200]   And it's true.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.000]   You don't care about any of this until it happens.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.680]   And that's the problem with all these companies who have IT departments.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.240]   Maybe the IT department does care, but as Ed pointed out, financially, the company doesn't.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.080]   And so they're like, no, you don't get the money for it.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.320]   So it's and you see this in medicine too, right?
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:53.320]   We know preventative medicine is much more effective than treating someone
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.360]   yet in the United States.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.320]   We don't put a lot of money towards preventative medicine.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.000]   And so I don't know how you solve this outside of that company.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.280]   There needs to be regulation.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.640]   You know, talk about the IoT thing before, you know, we're with it as period where people
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.000]   are just through Wi-Fi and everything.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.120]   And there was no security.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.400]   There's no standards.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.160]   And now you're starting to reap that, those security flaws.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.080]   And so it's going to change.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.520]   There will be standards coming along, but that's the problem here.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.320]   We need to have some regulation and some security.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.000]   And even that won't prevent everything, but it will at least set the ground
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:27.640]   floor for it.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.240]   And of course, the tech industry doesn't want regulation.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:36.120]   You know, Microsoft's in an unusual position because they were the first to get investigated
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.760]   back in 1998 by the Department of Justice.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.880]   They have been kind of left out of this current round of big tech investigations,
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:49.080]   Facebook, Google, Apple, taking the brunt and Amazon, the brunt of the hits.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:55.080]   There have been and we talked about this last week, six bills in Congress
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:03.640]   with bipartisan support to break up, to regulate, to change the way we monitor big tech.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.840]   And this was the week that big tech came to Washington lobbying like crazy.
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:15.560]   Tim Cook wrote a letter, actually it was a phone call to Nancy Pelosi warning them,
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.760]   warning her that the bills were rushed.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:26.920]   He told Pelosi, the CEO of Apple, that they would, the CEO of Apple told Nancy Pelosi,
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.120]   the speaker that has, they would, let me get the titles all right.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:34.440]   Tim Apple, you know them, that they would crimp these bills, would crimp innovation.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.920]   They would hurt consumers by disrupting the services that power Apple's iPhone.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:46.120]   And according to people with knowledge of the conversation, it's part of a forceful and wide
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.880]   ranging pushback, the New York Times says, by the tech industry since the proposals were announced.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:59.560]   And he said, if you looked at those bills, I haven't read all six of the bills I've read coverage
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:06.040]   about the bills. And I guess I'm of two minds on this. I mean, when we remember back to 1998,
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:09.000]   Microsoft wasn't broken up and lots of people thought it should have been.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.720]   And I sort of, I kind of feel like putting this kind of legislation out there,
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.880]   let's lawmakers go to their constituents and say, see, we're taking action against
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.640]   these huge companies that you all have told us you're concerned about.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:33.000]   And then perhaps it goes the way of what happened when the DOJ came after Microsoft.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.040]   I mean, there were some changes and requirements, but there were no breakups.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:48.280]   So there's that. And then I guess the flip side of that is really maybe nothing happens at all.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:54.840]   Maybe this is all political. Maybe there are so many people so upset. And it's something that
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:01.560]   the lawmakers can actually come together on and say, we're divided on lots of things,
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:06.840]   but we're unified on this. We're going to look out for your interests. These would be big tech,
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:12.680]   and they can look like they're doing just that. And then again, maybe not much comes of it.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:22.040]   You might think that could happen. But this week, the GOP, Republican Party,
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:30.840]   tweeted at the Democratic representative who introduced at least one of those bills that
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:39.400]   they said they accused him of taking money from Microsoft and allowing Microsoft to write that bill.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.280]   Great. So no, I don't think there's going to be a bipartisan.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:53.080]   That's a relief, actually. Last week, we had the host of the big technology podcast,
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.880]   the big technology newsletter, Alex Campter, what's on. And he said, at first, when I saw these,
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.040]   I thought there's no way that there'll be bipartisan support. There's no way they'll agree
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.240]   on this. But he said, he was said, I'm starting to get a little nervous.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:10.360]   Of course, Republicans have different reasons for wanting to send your big tech than the Democrats.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:17.000]   But even if the reasons are different, if they can get together to at least pass those bills,
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.080]   he thought that that actually might happen. I'm wondering, though. I think...
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:25.320]   I don't know. I mean, the EU has certainly decided that antitrust is
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:32.200]   going to come after the big tech companies. And so is the White House.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:40.360]   Lena Kahn is the new chair of the FTC. She's very much a probe breaking up. She wrote a paper in
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:47.960]   law school about breaking up Facebook, I think. She's very much considered an enemy of big tech.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:54.120]   That's coming from the left. It's going to be interesting.
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:59.160]   But as I said, big tech is not taking it lying down. They have lots of money to spend.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:06.040]   And I think honestly, money is probably the only language both Republicans and Democrats can
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.880]   agree on. I'll be shocked that they break up any company.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:15.080]   I don't think break up is necessary. But one of the bills says you can't acquire
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.600]   competition anymore. That was...
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.000]   Startups.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.320]   Yeah. No, start. That was, of course, what Facebook used to kill the competition from Instagram and
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:31.960]   WhatsApp. They wanted to buy Snapchat. Snapchat wouldn't sell to them. They saw Snapchat as an
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:42.040]   existential threat. Instead, they just copied them. That seemed to do some of the work.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:48.680]   We were talking about this before, how all the cloud apps start to look the same
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:53.080]   after a while. You can move from one to another and not really matter.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.000]   Well, even the desktop apps are pretty existent.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.600]   I think Mac and Windows are looking more and more alike these days.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.400]   The new Windows taskbar is the dock.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.160]   Yeah. Essentially.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.080]   It's the Mac...
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.520]   The center dock. That's right.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:13.800]   The center dock has a different twist on it in that it...
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:18.280]   Well, it still has a start menu. Apple never had a start menu and still doesn't.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:19.720]   One button.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:24.440]   Linux fans would say this is more Linux stealing than an Apple still.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.560]   It looks a little like a gnome.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.280]   Does it look like gnome?
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.320]   Yeah, it does look like gnome.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.480]   Although...
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.200]   By the way, gnome looks like it the way it looks because of the Apple.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:32.440]   So...
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.400]   We didn't mention this when we were talking about the web.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:37.800]   WSL.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:44.280]   But one of the changes that they've made is you will no longer be able to drag that taskbar
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.760]   to the side or the top.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.000]   Yes.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.560]   It has to sit at the bottom.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.960]   You can move the start menu to the left,
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.920]   but you can't put it on any other edge of the window.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.440]   Do you think that'll survive to October or they'll fix that?
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:02.680]   No, that'll survive because they've also said that they're going to allow you to.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.600]   If you don't like that, you can just say,
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.640]   "Give me the Windows 10 interface instead."
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.760]   The classic interface.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.760]   They did that with XP too, I remember.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.480]   Prime day.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.800]   Monday and Tuesday.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.480]   Of course, broke sales records.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.440]   It does every year.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:25.880]   In fact, it was big for third party sales as well.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:31.800]   Amazon said it was the biggest two-day sales period for third party sellers in the company's
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.360]   history.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:37.080]   And then in fact, in Amazon, of course, I'm anxious to say this,
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.920]   third party sales outpaced its own prime day sales.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:49.000]   250 million items sold, robotic vacuums, coffee makers, and crest white strips,
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.600]   some of the top selling products.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.360]   That's you, our priorities.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.600]   We got to drink the coffee and then go white in your seat.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.240]   Have coffee again.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.760]   Let's see.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.880]   I'm going to see if I have a number.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.640]   $11 billion.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:06.840]   That's a 6% increase over prime day back in October, according to Adobe Analytics.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.880]   And it wasn't just Amazon, by the way.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:17.000]   Walmart Target Costco Best Buy and Macy's all had on the same days, their own deal days or what have you.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.880]   I guess it's the new Black Friday.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:24.840]   I think it's real interesting in the context of the antitrust discussion, because they're not,
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.320]   they're not just making up that data.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.040]   Right.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.200]   Well, they really are a platform.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:36.760]   Do you, I mean, the case was made, you may have even made this at bought on previous shows,
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:42.120]   that even if Microsoft didn't get broken up, they really learned to be a little more judicious
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.440]   after the DOJ lawsuit.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:49.400]   Do you think that the big tech companies, Facebook, Amazon, Google,
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:55.720]   Apple are being more cautious now due to this scrutiny?
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:06.200]   Especially to Denise's point, especially because of Europe.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:15.560]   I think if it weren't for the EU enforcement, Facebook in particular, but Amazon also would be
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.240]   much more aggressive than they're being right now.
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:31.080]   That threat of antitrust action causes a lot of hesitation in doing things that they might have
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:36.920]   just jumped right into five years ago. It's especially an issue with Google.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:43.800]   And Apple too, Apple knows that their app store is a sore spot, and so they're trying to make
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.400]   somewhat, I would say, somewhat cosmetic changes, but they're trying to make some.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.960]   But they've at least pushed back on that with the
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.280]   big white paper.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:59.400]   Customer centric argument saying, our primary goal on this is the security of our customers.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.840]   And if you take away our control of the app store and the commerce, then you open the floodgates
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:11.080]   to bad things happening to our customers. And we're going to go to the mat on that one.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:19.960]   So they're at least trying to make the argument in a way that isn't just,
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:26.120]   this is legal to do this. They're saying it's moral and right for us to be doing this.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:30.760]   You think they're going to the court of public opinion on this? They're trying to get the public
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:37.080]   to say, Hey, stop messing with Apple. Tim Cook has said, allowing side loading would severely
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:41.080]   harm the security of our app store. Here's the white paper they put out this week,
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:46.520]   building a trusted ecosystem for millions of apps, featuring a father and young child,
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:52.840]   smiling as they look at their iPad, the important role of app store protections. This is
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:22:01.320]   quoting Steve Jobs back in 2007. This is a timeline of the app store that Apple put out. We're trying
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:07.160]   to do two diametrically opposed things that once provided advanced and open platform developers,
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:11.480]   while at the same time protect iPhone users from viruses, malware, private privacy attacks,
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:17.240]   etc. This is no easy task. That kind of sets the stage for the whole thing.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:24.280]   Facebook has done the same thing trying to really support public opinion.
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:32.840]   Right. We're saying that these actions that are going to cripple Facebook as you know,
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:40.920]   they're going to make it impossible for it to be free advertising supported content. If you take
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:48.040]   that away, then you'll lose all the things you love about Facebook. Facebook is not nearly as good.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:56.120]   Making those arguments as Apple is good. Look at this. A side loaded game bypasses parental controls.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:04.200]   And then the evil Fox with dollar sign eyes is going to get in and get your child to buy stuff.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:11.240]   No, won't you be sorry that you side loaded that game at the park? The copycat filter app John
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:17.000]   had side loaded threatens to lay all of his photos unless he pays up. There's that Fox again
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.680]   in the trees this time. Let's see. Here you are. That's not a cop. That's not a copycat.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:29.960]   Oh, it's a maybe it's a cat. No, look at the pointy snout. Fox is everywhere offended by this
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:37.480]   picture. That's terrible. Fire Fox is going to have some stir words. John writing his pellets on
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:43.560]   bike unknowingly downloads a pirated app from a third party app store and look at the coins flowing
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:50.200]   in to that Fox's net. I just assumed he was mining Bitcoin on that. Oh, maybe that's that's probably
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:56.280]   what it is. Come to think of it. Come to think of it. That's what's happening. Yeah, he's he's
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:03.560]   mining Bitcoin for the Fox. A side loaded app violates John's privacy and puts binoculars in the
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:11.400]   hands of the Fox. So there Apple completely ignoring the fact that the parental controls are a
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:17.480]   relatively recent development. Lots of us have kids who grew up paying that Fox the whole way.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:24.280]   Well, in fact, those parental controls came because Apple got sued by a family whose son spent
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:33.240]   tens of thousands of dollars on red fish and blue fish in some game. Yeah, yeah. Well, you know,
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:39.640]   you're you're the one who got hit Denise because my kids were too they were too old before that
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:43.720]   was a problem. You know, they weren't young with the iPhone, but your your son, I think, was right
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:49.400]   that age. He was right that age. And we didn't have any, you know, in family troubles about that.
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:53.880]   I think we were the exception because I definitely know friends whose kids, you know, they had they
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.600]   had to desperately call up Apple and say my kid just spent so much money. In my case, it was me,
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:03.400]   not the kids spent hundreds of dollars on Simpson tapped out donuts.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:12.680]   No, in my case, my kid would come to me with great big saucer eyes and say, yeah, this dragon
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:19.480]   and dragon veil is so cool. And I would run egg and go. Yep. Yeah, Michael did the same thing,
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:24.360]   but at least Michael always asked. But I but you know, I'm the one who gets the email from Apple saying,
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:30.120]   by the way, it's changed now. Michael is senior in high schools, no longer doing this,
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:38.040]   but his mom is. So I see a lot of purchases on the various games, at least is playing, which is fine.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:45.880]   You know, I get the email, but I'll make sure to charge her ages and stages, Leah. Yeah, it does.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:52.360]   It does. Oh, I can't complain. I'm the guy about a $7,000 gaming machine just to be a Viking in
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:59.800]   a game that is still occupying far more hours than I'd like to admit. Meanwhile, moving on,
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:05.160]   Wall Street Journal, by the way, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal that I saw Facebook full
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.840]   page ads saying, we need more regulation. What is that strategy? What are they up to?
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:17.240]   There is that preemptive like regulators? Don't pass these bills, but tech industry does need
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:26.040]   some regulation. Or is it? Yeah, I think Facebook's point is that the a lot of the laws that regulate
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.520]   the internet go back to the mid 90s. That's what they're saying. They're old laws. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:37.000]   Yeah. And they should pray. Well, and one of those laws is section 230, which
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:43.720]   which desperately needs. That's the 1996 law. That's the law they're talking about. Yeah.
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:50.680]   Yeah. So, so I'm not sure exactly what they're thinking there, but I think they want to.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:57.480]   It's preemptive. Be the legislature's partner rather than adversary. Yeah, exactly. And
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:04.920]   let's not forget that Facebook has done quite well as have Google Apple on Amazon and very likely
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:10.520]   would love to see laws that prevent competition from creeping up behind them. So, let's just make
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:15.720]   first party data be the only kind of data there is. No third party cookies. Google, by the way,
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:21.880]   has backed off. This is a story from this week on their plan to block third party cookies.
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:29.160]   Let me pull this up, John, for you on Chrome. They had planned to do it next year. Now they say,
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:38.760]   maybe it's going to be a couple of years. They pushed out the date by nearly two years saying,
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:45.000]   it takes time to fix privacy problems without hurting ad dependent websites.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:52.280]   And of course, our revenue because all of those ads come through Google.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:28:00.040]   So if you have that other article in the rundown about about insiders at Google saying,
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:04.680]   yeah, it's not the same company. It's not as nimble. It's not as fast. It's much more risk averse.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:09.000]   Yeah. I'm not sure about this article. We talked about this on Twig. It's a strange
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.280]   article. This is from the New York Times. Google executives, he cracks in their company's success.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:21.480]   And the blame is Sundar Pachai, according to this article, because he's too thoughtful and
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:31.800]   deliberative. And he's not acting fast enough. I, you know, this is Daisuke Waka, Waka Bayashi
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:37.880]   writing in the New York Times. I'm not. I don't know what to think about this.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:42.840]   I've been saying, I don't, I don't mind thoughtful and deliberative on them.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.200]   Big important issues like privacy. But at the same time, you know, I don't know,
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:54.600]   Apple's sure is, is trying to paint themselves as themselves as the privacy friendly.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:29:00.520]   Where we got your back company. The chief complaint in this Times article is that
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:09.160]   Google executives wanted to buy Shopify. Mr. Pachai rejected the idea because he thought Shopify
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:16.600]   was too expensive. And you know, and he kind of waffled over a period of time to kind of delay it.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:22.200]   They feel like he's too risk averse. Actually, I don't know if that's the problem with Google.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.040]   There's definitely a problem with Google. And it may be Sundar Pachai, but I don't think
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:31.720]   thoughtful and deliberative is the problem. I think Google kills too many projects,
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:39.000]   which is shaken confidence in its users. They have a huge problem with the firing of Timnet
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:45.480]   Jebrew, the AI ethics researcher who was critical of Google and immediately got fired,
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:52.680]   even though they hired her to do exactly that. I think they've got problems with employees.
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:00.920]   I'm not sure that Google is in great shape. And I guess you have to point to the CEO.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:06.920]   How important is a CEO at a company? We were talking about this on this week in Google on
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:13.000]   Wednesday. And I use such an Adela as the counter example. He is a, I would say, a great CEO.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.360]   You agree, Daniel? He's done a great job for Microsoft in his six years.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:21.960]   Yeah, I mean, a lot of people didn't think he was going to be good, or he was going to be too
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:26.360]   he comes from a cloud background. And that's where I mentioned earlier,
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.560]   kill Xbox, kill surface. And there were investors calling for that.
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:35.640]   And so, and he did give things a chance, Windows phone, he gave them a chance.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:39.640]   I think you guys get a couple of years to fix this. Otherwise, I'm going to cut it,
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:46.360]   and they didn't fix it. So I got cut. But yeah, he, I think you do need a good leader in that
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:53.400]   position. And it's a hard job, right? I think the best description of a CEO is not necessary
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:58.760]   the decisions they make. It's the people they put into the other positions to make those decisions.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:05.320]   That's what you said. Great job putting in great people in X-rays and in windows and so forth.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:12.360]   Yeah. Well, and that means that is the definition of what a good CEO does.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:17.800]   Sets the strategy so that it's clear and everybody knows what direction the ship is moving in,
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:24.440]   because these companies are big. You can't turn easily. So you got to set the strategy,
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:32.280]   hire the right people, and then let them, let them do their jobs. And then finally,
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:40.680]   keep from becoming a headline from the EU antitrust enforcement agencies.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:47.480]   Which he's done. He's decisive too. The very first thing he did as CEO was kill.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:54.840]   It was in Windows RT and they had a Surface Mini or something that they were going to ship.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:58.120]   Surface Mini. Yeah. And there were thousands in the warehouse.
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:02.360]   And he said, "Nope, we're not going to ship that product." That was one of the very first
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:09.400]   things he did. So you can't accuse him of being too deliberative. He never liked the Nokia acquisition,
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:15.720]   wrote that off as quickly as he could, wrote off Overture, the ad business acquisition at the same
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:18.680]   time. Yeah, I think he's actually- And he's right about that stuff.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:24.120]   Yes. He made the right move. Yeah. I mean, he brings up a Windows phone about how mad
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:28.360]   they are about that. But it was the right decision. He gave him, it sounded like he didn't come in
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:33.640]   in 2015 and go, "Windows phone's gone." No, he gave him. He's like, "You have a runway. You
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:38.120]   have a couple of years. Let's figure this out." They didn't figure it out. And then he killed it.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.240]   But he makes the right decisions. And he did kill off a lot of stuff that came from Ballmer,
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:47.960]   who listened. Ballmer had a very different approach. He wanted to be the consumer company.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:52.760]   He had a vision there. And Nadella was like, "Nope, we're going back to our roots." And they've been
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:56.760]   dragging the company in another direction. And it's been the right direction. They're making money,
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:03.320]   and they're being successful. So I can't speak to Google too much, but you're right. They're having
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:08.360]   a lot of turnover with employees, apparently. There's discontent. It's never a good thing when
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:13.720]   your VPs are talking behind your back, to New York Times, about faith in you as a leader.
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:19.240]   So there's definitely even just the perception of this is really bad. But I can't speak internally
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:25.240]   to what they do to fix it. They've always been fundamentally Google. We know they have the Pixel,
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:29.560]   Google Search, Gmail, but fundamentally they're an ad company. And that's always been hard to
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:33.720]   square with this perception of that they're a consumer company or they're an ad company.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.680]   And so there's always that tension there. It's also a unique challenge for them,
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:40.680]   because they're so successful as an ad company and make so much money.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:44.520]   Historically, really, they haven't made much money on anything else. Even the success of
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:49.560]   YouTube is based on its advertising that they don't have to succeed in anything else. And that's
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:55.400]   a result they really haven't. A lot of the other bets that Google has been putting money into have
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:02.920]   gone away or been canceled, because they just they just not take it off. And yeah, they're very
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:09.080]   successful. To your point about CEOs, I think we could all sit here and look at companies like
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:17.960]   Amazon or Facebook or Windows. Sorry, Windows Microsoft, Apple, and we could pull out.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:24.920]   Great CEOs in all cases. Yeah, and we could pull out some strategies that we would associate
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:30.200]   with those CEOs. And I think that's harder to do with Google right now. What is its strategy?
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:39.080]   Yeah, what is it? What is it CEO charting for it in the future? And if you looked at it years ago,
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:44.520]   as it's starting out and it's scrappy and it wants to offer people the best darn search results,
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:50.440]   and it wants to have people focus on their 20% time and come up with great creative things that
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:57.400]   they didn't even know would be important until they were developed. I don't know that Google has
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:03.000]   that at this moment. And maybe it needs to regain it. They never came up with a second act. They're
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.880]   still they're still doing what they did when they started. And the weirdest one is augmented reality.
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:16.200]   Where are they what they are in VR? They were there early. They were the glass was way ahead of the
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:22.280]   curve. And it's like, all right, early missteps, pull it back. What's happened with that story,
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:27.160]   though? Apple, you know, big rumors that there go me entering this field pretty soon.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:32.040]   Microsoft's are already making billions apparently in this field. And with HoloLens,
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:37.240]   they're doing very well with HoloLens. Interesting. Yeah, my my take on that is maybe they're just
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:43.480]   sinking so much into AI at this point that we don't really see the impact of that yet,
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:50.200]   but we will. Yeah, and I bought north. I say that was sort of a sense of foreboding in my voice,
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:57.000]   as I say. That's that's chapter one of the dystopian novels. Yes.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:04.840]   Right. Speaking of dystopia, I thought this was fascinating. I'm a fan of spy novels, spy movies.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:16.040]   The Wall Street Journal talks about an app called premise, which is being used by the US military
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:24.440]   and and intelligence agencies to spy in effect abroad. The idea of premise is they
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:31.480]   primarily pays users in the developing world to complete basic tasks for small payments.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:39.080]   Typical assignments include snapping photos, filling out surveys, doing other basic data collection
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:44.280]   or observational reporting like counting ATMs or reporting on the price of consumer goods like
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.840]   food. About half the company's clients are private businesses looking for commercial
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:55.320]   information. We want to open a a bank in Santiago. How many ATMs are there? Where should we put our
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:04.040]   ATM? But apparently a lot of the work being done about half these days is for the US and other
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:09.560]   governments. They're marketing the capability of its flexible global gig based workforce to do
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:17.880]   basic reconnaissance and gauge public opinion. The company says 90% of its work is gauging public
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:24.600]   sentiment and understanding human geography by paying users to fill out surveys. A small number
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:29.640]   of projects involve asking users to go out into the world and take pictures or walk a predetermined
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:35.480]   route. Sometimes these tasks involve collecting data on nearby wireless signals or other cell phones.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:43.560]   This is from premise CEO, Maury Blackman. Data gained from our contributors helped inform
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:49.160]   government policymakers on how to best deal with vaccine hesitancy, susceptibility to foreign
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.520]   interference and misinformation and elections, as well as the location and nature of gang activity
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:38:00.920]   in Honduras, which is oddly specific. They would not name their clientele.
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.640]   That's the first chapter of the dystopian novel.
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:12.680]   In a nutshell. This is as captured as a service.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:17.480]   Yeah, I really resent these Google captures because I know I'm teaching
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:21.880]   themselves driving cars how to find crosswalks and buses. It pisses the hell out of me every
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:29.000]   time I have to do it. It makes sense. You've got to work forces willing for a nickel or a dime or
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.240]   a buck to do some basic reconnaissance. They're carrying around the ultimate reconnaissance tool.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:39.320]   These smartphones are always connected. They've got GPS, they've got cameras and microphones.
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:45.800]   It's perfect. There was one fascinating thing I found in that article, which is that they
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:54.680]   said in some cases the tasks that they were assigning to people were the task itself was irrelevant.
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:39:02.840]   They mainly wanted them to move around and map the existence of like the or the strength of
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:11.800]   cell tower signals, or Wi-Fi or something like that. So just go and find Bodegas.
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:18.520]   Meanwhile, they're walking around and the real data is being collected automatically.
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:26.200]   In fact, Premise apparently submitted a pitch to the British government last summer saying,
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:31.000]   "We can capture more than 100 types of metadata from our contributors' phones and provide them
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.160]   to paying customers, including location, type, battery level, and installed apps."
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:47.000]   So I brought up AI earlier. Obviously, these clients are not nominatively AI, but they're clearly
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   using machine learning to crunch all this data. It makes me think about, there are a lot of people
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:59.480]   wondering what happens when all of our jobs have become irrelevant because AI can do it better
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:06.600]   and creates more free time for all of us in the process. Well, this will be something that AI
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:11.480]   always needs as data, sending people out into the world. It's even more dystopian. We're basically
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:17.960]   the servants of the AI now. The AI is making all the decisions, but it needs raw data. So,
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:27.000]   hey, you guys, just walk around a little bit. We need meat. We need meat. Oh my god. Fascinating
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:34.520]   story. So Brian, Byron Tow at the Wall Street Journal. Kudos for that great story.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.800]   Instagram is changing how it works. Actually, let me take a break and then we'll talk about
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:47.400]   that in a lot more live audio rooms, aka Clubhouse at Facebook. Facebook's introducing
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:54.040]   Clubhouse just as Clubhouse is going downhill, right? And did John McAfee really commit suicide?
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:41:00.680]   The conspiracy theories have begun. But first, a word from our sponsor. Was that a good tease?
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:05.640]   Does that make you want to stay? Yeah, I think so. I showed it to you by podium.
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:12.840]   It's great. We had a contractor come out, trying to remember what they were working on.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.920]   And then after they left, we got a text message from them saying, "How was our work?
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.920]   Rate us on Google." And of course, I did. Yeah, that was cool because the text message
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:23.960]   started to open all the text messages. That's what they were using podium.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:31.800]   One of the good things that has come from this past year has been many of the on-demand options.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:36.040]   Blockbuster movie releases at home, curd side pickup from your favorite restaurant,
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:43.480]   visiting your doctor remotely. Your customers, if you're a small business, have grown to expect a
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:48.920]   simpler way of doing business no matter what your product is. That's why more than 90,000 local
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:55.000]   businesses of all sizes, including my dentist. Some of our contractors have turned to podium.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.040]   Whether you have one location or 1000 podium can help you stay ahead. See, it turns out
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:10.200]   we like to text. People read their text messages. And frankly, I just ask you, if you had a choice
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:16.360]   between interacting with somebody via phone or text, wouldn't you prefer text? Well, your customers
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:22.440]   would too. Podium makes doing business as easy as sending a text because when texts get opened,
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:26.920]   business gets done. And it's great. Your employees will love it because they can text from a single
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:32.360]   inbox, offering a great experience, a much smoother experience for your customers in a lot easier,
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:37.720]   more responsive way for your employees to stay in touch. If you're answering questions,
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:43.080]   you send a text. You're collecting reviews. You send a text. Schedule an appointment or delivery
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:49.320]   send a text payment collection to yes, they do payments. Just send a text. Car dealerships use
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:58.040]   podium to sell more cars by offering text messaging. We know of one dealer who sold a $50,000 truck
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:02.360]   by sending four different text messages. That's it. Dealerships are running profitable service
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:07.720]   centers with easier appointment scheduling reminders. I just did that to a schedule appointment on my
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:12.680]   Ford. It was awesome. Home service providers are responding faster and winning more jobs than
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:18.280]   their competition. When a homeowner wants to get in touch, they're going to leave a voicemail. Text
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.680]   is easier for them and it lets you get back in touch faster. By the way,
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:30.600]   if a homeowner texts five different businesses, if you're the first to reply, you are way more
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:36.120]   likely to get the job. Retailers are increasing revenue by allowing customers to shop via text
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.360]   message. Even with stores open, we've gotten used to this whole idea of shopping from home.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:46.760]   A jeweler just sold a $5,000 ring and even coordinated curbside pickup with podium.
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:52.680]   Local service professionals keep clients longer and collect payments faster. It's great that they
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:57.880]   take payments. There's a dentist in New York City, had a million dollars in overdue collections.
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:03.560]   He just sent everyone a text payment request, collected 70%, $700,000 in just two weeks.
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:10.120]   Because it's easier people like using text. Today's customers expect on-demand everything,
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.920]   even from local businesses. This is the time. Stay ahead of the competition with podium.

[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:53.720]   podium.com/twit. We thank you for your support. This week we had a fabulous week. Before we get
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:57.960]   back to the stories of the week, let's take a look at what happened this week on Twitch.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:04.920]   This was tweeted. A mother raccoon and her babies invaded my attic. I put a speaker wish
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:11.560]   where she could hear it. You and Leo prompted her to decamp. Why did you include me in this?
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.200]   It could have just been you. Previously on Twitch.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:24.600]   Twitch news. A brand new look for Windows. Windows 11. The App Store is brand new and I think pretty
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:30.760]   much the biggest announcement will be that Android apps will be available in the Microsoft Store
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:38.840]   via Amazon's Store and using Intel Bridge software. All about Android. I review the Pixel Buds A
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:45.880]   Series earbuds and this new chipset Google says is there to improve on that wireless connectivity
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:50.920]   issue that last year's model saw. I can tell you in my time with this, I didn't have any dropouts.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:56.760]   I didn't experience any of that. This week in Google. There's all sorts of issues and I don't
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:01.720]   see amazing, I don't see anything interesting coming out of Google in the last couple of years.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:06.760]   I think we're going to have to stop measuring technology based on cool devices and start measuring
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:12.760]   it based on five years ago. What did my experience look like and today how much smoother is it and
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:18.200]   it's going to be super incremental and we're not going to be odd by it. Smart tech today.
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:23.160]   It's like being part of a group project. Yeah. And a group project with each of the individual
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:28.360]   assistants and it's just like, oh my god, like Siri just is still not even working.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:31.720]   The Google Assistant has said I can't do that for you. You didn't know it all.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:36.600]   Can I order something from Amazon for you? Twitch. You know what? I'll just do it.
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.720]   I'll don't need it all. I'll do it. I love it.
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:50.920]   John McAfee, it was breaking news, I think on Wednesday. He was held since October in a jail
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:58.600]   in Barcelona, held for extradition to the United States where he's being charged with tax evasion.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:05.160]   Word came down from a Spanish court that he would be extradited several hours later.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:12.920]   He was dead, found dead in his cell in a prison near Barcelona. 75 years old. He actually was
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:18.840]   arrested in Barcelona in October as he was on the run from Belizean authorities who wanted to question
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:26.680]   him about the murder of his neighbor. Well, his wife, Janice McAfee, just held a press conference,
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:33.480]   she said, John was not suicidal. She somehow blamed United States authorities for this tragedy.
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:39.720]   I'm not sure exactly how. You may remember when he was arrested in October, he tweeted,
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:44.920]   "Hey, this is a great jail. I like the people. The food is good. If I ever commit suicide,
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:53.960]   no, it's more of an Epstein thing. It wasn't me." That's also led to a little conspiracy theory.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:58.520]   Well, I guess we're left with just two words. What's that?
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:05.320]   Sotation conspiracy. Sotation? Those are whales. Whales.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:20.040]   He was, I mean, look, in the early days, he was a very impressive guy. I think he was working at
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:29.880]   Lockheed in 2000. I'm sorry, when he discovered the brain virus and wrote the
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:35.640]   first antivirus, McAfee became a very dominant antivirus force, was sold to Intel, I think, in 2010.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:43.480]   He had other businesses that he followed, including some oddball drug use and cryptocurrency
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:49.640]   businesses. That's what he's in trouble for, is apparently crypto-scurrency scams and not declaring
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:59.720]   income for two years. But he also ran for president for the Libertarian Party in 2016 and 2020.
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:05.480]   He thought he was being persecuted for running for president. I don't think so.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:11.880]   Yeah. I know people who knew him back in the days. I talked to one of them last week. He said,
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:18.120]   he was never bolted together correctly. Even in the beginning.
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:30.440]   There's a tremendous record of people. Tremendous creativity goes with tremendous dysfunction.
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:37.960]   Then you throw a lot of money at it. There's no longer any rules.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:48.520]   No consequences. There was the guy who started, Tony Shea, the guy who started Zappos.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.920]   Isn't that a sad story? Yeah, that's a very similar story.
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:50:02.280]   In some ways, if someone who made so much money that anybody who said no to him,
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:12.120]   he was just able to disappear and then became at that point whatever dysfunctions you have
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:22.280]   become the dominant force in your life. When you go through the Wikipedia article about his
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:28.680]   various businesses, he was incredibly energetic and creative. He started one of the first instant
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:36.040]   messaging platforms, Pow Wow, with a company, Tribal Voice. He invested and joined the board of
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:44.360]   zone lab makers of a zone alarm back in the day prior to its acquisition. At one point in the
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:50.520]   2000s, he was investing in an advertising ultra light flights. He called it arrow trekking.
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:59.560]   He started a company called Quorum X, headquartered in Belize in 2010, aimed to produce herbal antibiotics.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:08.280]   He uploaded a parody video called How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus on his YouTube in 2013.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:14.760]   In it, he critiques the antivirus software while snorting white powder and being stripped by
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:24.280]   scannelling glad women. He got 10 million views. In 2013, he founded Future 10 Central,
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:29.560]   which aimed to produce a secure computer network device called the Decentral. He announced a
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:35.080]   company in 2014 called Cognizant, which in a way, I think it was ahead of its time. It was an
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:39.800]   application for smartphones, which displays information about the permissions of other installed
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:48.040]   applications. Did eventually release an Android version of that. In 2014, he warned people at
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:53.640]   DEF CON not to use smartphones saying apps are used to spy on clueless consumers who don't
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:52:03.880]   read privacy agreements. That wasn't wrong. Anyway, it goes on and on and on. He clearly had a lot of
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:12.280]   energy. He was doing cryptocurrencies towards the end, and he's being accused of fleecing investors
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:22.040]   with his crypto security companies. It's a sad story, I guess. His fortune was estimated at one
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:28.520]   point to be worth 100 million towards the end, much, much smaller as low as $4 million.
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:40.040]   John McAfee did at 75. I'm sure that the conspiracies will now proliferate as they have.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:46.920]   He said it out perfectly, right? He always trafficked it and used it in conspiracies.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:50.520]   I can't think of a better way to do that than just preemptively put it out there. Like,
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:55.080]   hey, if anything happens to me, it's because of a conspiracy. Then of course,
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:02.040]   now you're going to see it's true. It's like, I don't know. He was a master of coal. Andy Kaufman
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:06.120]   is doing what he did. Andy Kaufman is going, damn, dude, wish I'd thought of that.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:13.080]   Right. Yeah. Well, I actually saw some people speculate that he is not dead, that he paid off
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:25.720]   the Spanish jailers. I don't know. He got a tattooed. He had tweeted, if you read that I've
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:35.880]   been, that I've committed suicide, I was whacked. He actually got a tattoo whacked, W-H-A-C-K-D.
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:41.880]   He said, I got a tattoo. He tweeted, this is back in 2019. I got a tattoo today, just in case.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:47.640]   If I suicide myself, I didn't. I was whacked. Check my right arm. I'm not sure what the dollar sign has
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:53.720]   to do with it. Whacked. Huh? Shwacked?
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:54:05.720]   Is it because of Bitcoin maybe? I was shocked. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not one to believe
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:10.840]   in conspiracy theory. It was about to get extradited to the US to... Yeah, the timing was interesting.
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:20.200]   Yeah. I mean, he's going broke. Right. And he's going broke and his legal fees for a case like that
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:31.800]   are going to take every penny that he has. And he's facing a 30-year potential 30-year
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:37.800]   sentence. It's a life sentence. And if he believed, as I'm sure he did, that the government was at
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:42.280]   again. I mean, he probably doesn't believe he could get off. So yeah, maybe he just thought,
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:49.400]   I'm going to deprive them of the... I mean, people change their minds when you want to say.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:56.040]   Yeah, he changes his mind. He said there would be no more nothing after Windows 10, right?
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:59.320]   Yeah, there we are. People change their minds. People change their minds.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:05.480]   And not to be too late. We can pretty much credit Microsoft for his success, right? He was able to
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.680]   sell a very effective antivirus. Thanks to Microsoft Windows.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:13.800]   Yes. Right. Now, there are... I think he started with MS-DOS.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:18.200]   Oh, yeah. I think he was thinking '80s. You're right. It was the '80s. You're exactly right.
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:23.560]   Yeah. Hey, before we move on, I do want to mention, as we should anytime suicide is mentioned,
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:28.680]   that this is a triggering topic for a lot of people. If you are thinking about suicide,
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:33.480]   or you're worried about a friend or a loved one, there is help out there. People really care.
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:38.680]   We really want you around. If you want some emotional support, if you want somebody to talk to,
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:46.280]   the Lifeline network is available 24/7 everywhere in the US, suicide prevention lifeline.org or call
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:55.240]   800-273-8255. And I'm sure every country where we have listeners offers something similar.
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:58.600]   Please take care of yourself. We don't want anything to happen to you.
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:07.160]   Frank McCourt, real estate mogul, billionaire, he apparently is going to save the internet.
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:13.960]   He's a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He says, "I'm going to spend $100 million to rebuild
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:19.960]   social media." The effort he's called Project Liberty centers on the construction of a publicly
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:25.880]   accessible database of people's social connections, allowing users to move records of their relationships
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:32.760]   between social media services. I don't know what the technical underpinnings are, but $100 million
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:39.080]   is enough money probably to get some people working on this. It would use the blockchain
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:46.760]   to construct a new internet infrastructure called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol,
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:55.080]   DSNP. The guy he's hired to build it, I don't know, his name is Braxton Woodham,
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:01.080]   co-founder of the Meal Delivery Service Sun Basket, former CTO at Fandango.
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:06.440]   Apparently, Woodham had been thinking about something like this. This sounds like a TV show.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:12.280]   Maybe that's the... Maybe Netflix is going to give a billion dollars for the $100 million he's
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:19.960]   going to spend. Doesn't it? It sounds like startup. The one I like about this idea,
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:26.760]   the one thing I like about this idea is they're going to have a public version of this,
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:30.520]   like a demonstration app or something, but they're not really trying to be like,
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:35.320]   "We're going to create another Facebook just differently." They're creating the underpinnings
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:42.120]   for further newer social networks to build off of. That might actually stand a chance,
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:47.800]   because this was just... All we've seen so far is like, "Oh, Twitter stinks. Let's do Parlor."
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:52.600]   Everybody's trying to create just an alternate version of something that already exists.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.480]   It knows almost never work, but this is a little bit different. I do like the...
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:03.720]   Let's go under the... Create the underpinnings for a new system of social apps. I think if we
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:09.000]   could reset the internet right now, we would all do it way differently to be... We wouldn't...
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.480]   Charging people for information. I've just given away for all for free for once.
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:20.280]   There's maybe a way to do that. I still think it's a massive uphill to climb, but it is different.
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:25.480]   I like the idea. It's the idea is use blockchain for two reasons. One, to make your social graph
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:30.360]   portable so you can move it around. But he also says blockchain would discourage bad behavior,
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:34.600]   because people would be tied to their posts forever. I don't know if that's a good idea.
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:41.480]   That's way trippy. But maybe it is. Maybe if you knew that what you wrote on Twitter was going to live
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:48.680]   on forever. Doesn't South Korea do this where you have to be registered with ID and stuff like that?
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:53.000]   I know some countries do control this. There's always been this attempt of...
[01:58:54.200 --> 01:59:02.920]   When it's tied to your public real name and a history, that does a result of accountability.
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:08.520]   The way people behave on the internet is very differently than how people would behave in person.
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:13.320]   Not always the case, especially in the United States. People do still bad behavior on Facebook.
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:18.360]   But there's at least a beast just having a random name or something like that and no
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:23.240]   accountability. I think this is an interesting thing with the blockchain.
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:26.520]   It follows you and it works both ways.
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:35.800]   The ACLU is selling a new t-shirt. Have you seen it? I think you've seen it from your laugh.
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:44.920]   The ACLU... Yeah, I can show it. I don't know if I can read it. I can show it. Go ahead, show it,
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:49.960]   John. Come on, John's my unofficial sensor. You can show it. I won't say it out loud.
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:58.440]   F school, softball, cheer, everything. Denise, you know what this is. This is a very famous
[01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:05.320]   tweet. Tell us your story. As a lawyer who deals with social media issues and the mother of a high
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:10.680]   schooler, I definitely know what this t-shirt is. I may be buying this t-shirt from the ACLU.
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:20.040]   I know, I kind of like it. Tell us the story. Interestingly, there was a young woman who was 14
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:25.160]   years old, which I think is really interesting. You see that sort of glossed over. How many 14
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:30.680]   year olds get so upset about not making varsity? Is that really the era we're living in now? But
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:39.240]   apparently so. She was a cheerleader. She did not make varsity and got upset and went on Snapchat and
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:47.720]   did that t-shirt quote rant. And importantly, didn't do it on school premises, didn't do it on
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:51.960]   school time, didn't mention anybody. The school didn't even mention the school.
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:59.080]   Just did a message because she was upset. And she was sad and she used a strong word,
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:06.840]   but that's not illegal. No. And that's exactly where the courts wound up with this. Ultimately,
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:13.480]   the Supreme Court of the United States in an 8-1 decision. So we had sort of resounding
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:20.840]   agreement on this. Who was the dissenter? It was Clarence Thomas, who said historically,
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:26.360]   schools could discipline students in circumstances like those presented here. Well,
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:31.800]   historically, we didn't have Snapchat that kids could rant on. So she was 14. She was a high
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:37.640]   schooler. And what did the school do when she posted that? They suspended her for a year.
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:46.520]   Wow. It got yes. It got that year. Yes. And importantly, public school, right? Who are the
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:52.760]   only school entities that we need to concern ourselves with and discuss the First Amendment
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:57.720]   about. A private school could do it, I presume. Correct. Yes. Private schools, private companies,
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:01.800]   First Amendment doesn't impact their mission. So John, if you were to actually tweet this,
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:06.920]   even if it was at home on his private time, I could fire him for that? No.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:14.120]   You can. Yeah. I could. It wouldn't be illegal. We're in an hour. If you have an
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:19.320]   out-will employee. Yeah. All of our employees are out-will. You're not constrained by the First
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:23.640]   Amendment. You are not part of the government. But the government, which is a public school,
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:27.800]   is the government. The public schools are. Historically, it's always, you know,
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:31.240]   and I come from an era where the schools would tell you how long your hemline could be,
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:36.840]   whether what t-shirts you could wear, you should cut your hair. And it's always bugged the hell out of
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:42.920]   me. But still, that's attending school. This wasn't even during school hours on school property.
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:49.080]   Correct. So the school was reaching out to say to this teenager, we control every aspect of your
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:54.600]   personal life. Right. And I know you have school-aged kids, Leo. I don't know about
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:03.400]   Dan and Ed, and lots of folks listening. But I've been noticing more and more that schools
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:10.200]   attempt to get parents and kids, even that don't get me started. They try and get kids to sign
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:16.920]   documents, which I always think is hilarious because, of course, anything a child under the age of 18
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:23.400]   signs is not legally valid as a contract or anything else. But be that as it may. They think
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:28.760]   it sends a message if you have a child sign off on something that they've read and acknowledged it.
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:36.200]   But they have parents, which is more critical. Also agree that these are the policies that
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:41.720]   will govern their children. And those off-campus policies are starting to get a little concerning
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:49.320]   where the school will let you know, hey, we reserve the right if your kid is misbehaving in a way
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:54.440]   that we find troublesome that we can discipline that child even when they're not on campus.
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:04:03.080]   So this case was sort of a test of that and how much authority they actually have. And it's not
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:11.960]   that they have no authority if the court was clear that there could be situations where there's a
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:18.760]   substantial interest in regulating the conduct. For example, severe bullying threats aimed at
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:24.200]   teachers or students, participation in online school activities or hacking into school computers.
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:31.720]   She said, "If another person on the cheerleading squad, that would be very, very different." I
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:39.240]   don't think a court upheld this or would have overdressed this. But just a general teenage rant
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:44.760]   with something that-- You should be allowed to be upset. Yeah, good quote from the opinion,
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:49.560]   sometimes it is necessary to protect the superfluous in order to preserve the necessary.
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:54.040]   Great line. Who wrote the decision? Justice Breyer, who wrote the decision.
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:59.880]   Beautifully written. And Justice Breyer who's in his 80s and is under some pressure to retire.
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:02.280]   That would be a great opinion to go out on. It really would.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:04.600]   There the pressure continues.
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:09.080]   I don't know what this--
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:18.360]   I was going to say my only concern with this decision was it was kind of an easy decision.
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:24.360]   When we look at what she said being the context out of school, to me it was cut and dry, this was
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:29.880]   an issue. The question is, Denise, you're just talking about this idea of regulating behavior,
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:35.640]   what if it was racist behavior? I feel like people on the left then would have come from the
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:40.920]   other angle because when the school wants to do some kind of punitive action against the
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:46.920]   student from maybe going on a racial tirade on one of your social networks, what would that
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:52.520]   be like? So this case was really easy to decide, but go ahead.
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:58.840]   I think in the wake of this decision, there's at least guidance on that. I think that what you
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:06.840]   would see is courts deciding, well, it's unpopular speech, but if it's not directly threatening or
[02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:13.480]   there might be some protection there, but it would depend on the exact statement and whether it
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:18.120]   could be construed as bullying or a threat or some sort of--
[02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:28.200]   Well, the school said we took action because other students followed her Snapchat, including
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:32.920]   some of the cheerleaders. One of the students who received the photo showed them to her mother,
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:37.560]   who was a cheerleading squad coach and the images spread that week, several cheerleaders and other
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:42.360]   students approached the cheerleading coaches visibly upset about her post. It's really interesting.
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:47.960]   You raised an interesting question, Daniel. What if they had been racist? That's an interesting
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:56.520]   question. You're right. In this case, it was pretty clear cut. Nobody's feelings were heard.
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:00.840]   Nobody was named. Maybe some feelings. You could put it on a t-shirt and wear it.
[02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:07.320]   Right. It's funny, which goes to tell you how unserious her speech was, or the comments she made.
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:12.280]   Talk about making this Supreme Court case out of it, though. Her dad in the ACLU said, "No, no,
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:14.680]   we're going to take this all the way to Supreme Court."
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:19.000]   And it's the issue of you. You know how long that takes? She's in college now.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.920]   She's in college. Yeah. And the ACLU has a history of defending
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:31.560]   unpopular and even unpleasant speech, going all the way back to the case involving the
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:38.440]   Skokie, Skokie, Illinois. And that's it. Yeah. And I don't have kids,
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:45.320]   but I do have a history with the ACLU in free speech. When I was in junior high school,
[02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:51.320]   I was suspended for publishing an underground newspaper. Really? And it was the ACLU that
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:56.680]   took my case to the school board. It didn't have to go to court. It took it to the school board,
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:08:03.720]   and the school board reinstated me. And they said, he could hand out his newspapers
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:09.560]   in the lunchroom. He just can't go into classrooms and do it. But I think we had either three or
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:18.280]   four editions that we published. And thanks to the ACLU, we got to do it. What a great story.
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:23.400]   That's fantastic. See, Ed and I have a lot in common because I, too, have an ACLU high school
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:29.160]   story. What? My best friend. My best friend wore a, there's a punk band called Bad Religion,
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:35.160]   and their sign is the cross crossed out called a crossbuster. And he would wear it to school.
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:39.560]   The principal told them he couldn't wear it. And it kicked off a whole dress code fight in our
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:44.360]   school. And he said, Oh, it came in and, you know, we were going to sue them, but they backed down.
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:48.440]   So yeah, they're, they're a good organization. And then you learn a lot in high school.
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:58.120]   The, the shirt. Both, both of those are good ACLU cases dealing with on campus speech. But I think
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:02.840]   it's even harder to make the case that something that's done off campus. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:08.680]   Wow. There you go. There's the, yeah, there we go. There's the bad religion logo.
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:12.520]   Hause is a lot of looks. Public high school.
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:18.760]   Wow. We got a couple of rebels here. I'll tell you, that's awesome. It's great,
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:24.040]   great to have you. Cash, we're kind of at the two hour mark. Is there any other story
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:30.840]   that I have missed the bad week for Bitcoin? China is now shutting down over 90% of its Bitcoin
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:38.840]   mining capacity, which has led to a drop in the speed with which Bitcoin hashes are calculated,
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:46.040]   slowing down the transaction rate Bitcoin, maybe coincidentally, also went down in value. And then
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:49.800]   there was the South African Bitcoin,
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:59.080]   the brothers brothers, yeah, who disappeared with a significant amount of Bitcoin, probably the
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:05.560]   biggest since Mount Gox disappearance of Bitcoin. They were creating a Bitcoin
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:15.480]   investment fund and claimed they had been hacked for $3.6 billion then disappeared.
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:21.960]   Probably were probably was hacked. They were probably hacked. Yeah.
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:36.200]   I just, I do not, I do not understand, I cannot wrap my mind around where cryptocurrency is going
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:45.160]   to end up in the scheme of things. There seems to be this sort of wall that it hits
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:52.280]   some point where it doesn't take the place of fiat currency. I don't care what the country of
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:58.840]   El Salvador does. It's, and they may live to regret, by the way. I mean, it's such a
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:07.560]   bottle currency. They may live to regret that choice. I just don't, I can't wait to see how it
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:15.000]   ends, but I just can't, I keep trying to plot this out and seeing how it all works out. I know
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:22.920]   I saw that Andresan Horowitz is now there on their third cryptocurrency fund.
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:29.800]   Huge fund. Yeah. They're up to billions of dollars that they're investing in cryptocurrency
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:37.880]   infrastructure and brokers and traders and stuff. And this just seems to me like,
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:48.120]   beanie babies where you don't even get a beanie baby. You don't even get a beanie baby. What's the point?
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:59.080]   You could get a crypto kitty. I think that's well put in the sense that you don't know what's
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:05.000]   going to happen. It's not like this is a bad idea, but I don't, I don't, I don't either see clearly
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:11.160]   how this happens. I think something's happening, but I don't understand how it's even, even major
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:17.480]   government banks, including the Federal Reserve have said some sort of stable coin might well be
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:22.520]   in the future for, for governments. There's a lot to be, I mean, really,
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:30.600]   these days your dollar bill is as digital as anything. None of my, I don't have cash for anything.
[02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:36.920]   I own it's all bits being, you know, in ledgers, decentralized ledgers is the only
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:43.880]   and touchless, touchless payment. Yes. Just basically become, I don't, if they just like,
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:48.200]   I don't give a cash for the grocery store anything. I don't, I don't like virtual meeting,
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:53.960]   watch over it. Yeah, virtual meetings in virtual school were able to skip like five years,
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.320]   thanks to the pandemic. Right. And, and touchless payments have done the same thing.
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:05.080]   I agree on it. I actually looked now for somewhere where I can use my Apple watch to pay. And I'm
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:10.920]   very always very happy when I find it. And I have to say, by the way, it, when I first started doing
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:17.800]   that, I think was with a Samsung phone or watch. People thought I was crazy. Now it's like obvious,
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:23.320]   you know, everybody does it. You're still using dollars. Yeah, they're technically dollars.
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:31.480]   But that's just a word. I mean, I do carry cash, but yeah, because I'm crypto is it's,
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:36.600]   it's very complicated. Like we're all most of us here involved in tech and it's like,
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:42.920]   oh, you start going into crypto. Yeah, it becomes very, very complicated, not just economics, but in
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:49.560]   terms of how it works, how to back it up the ledgers and the keys. And then that's just dealing with
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:53.640]   like say, Bitcoin, we all understand, okay, there's this thing Bitcoin. But then when you
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:58.200]   learn, there's like 150 other cryptocurrencies out there and even more, you can just create them
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:04.040]   yourself. It becomes very weird. Like, what is that? That is one thing to say, here's a US dollar.
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:08.760]   Here's an alternative to the US dollar. What does it mean when there's 200 other alternatives
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:14.840]   all of a sudden, which one means anything, right? So I think that's basically puts us another way.
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:20.200]   I don't think Apple would ever invent this, right? It's too opaque for the masses to really get
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:26.360]   evolved with. It's also ready to take a look at these guys. We've just made off with 69,000 Bitcoin
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:33.000]   or Mt. Gox, where people lost a lot of money. Now the UK financial watchdog has banned Binance
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:39.880]   saying they're violating some sort of UK finance rules. That's one of the big Bitcoin exchanges.
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:45.320]   Binance markets limited is not permitted to undertake any regulated activity in the UK
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:51.960]   as of yesterday. So I think that's probably the biggest problem.
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:56.360]   It's just-- I read that article and was unclear on whether that meant they couldn't continue to let
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:15:02.600]   people buy and sell or whether it was more of a securities- Is that a regulated activity, though?
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:08.040]   I don't know. I don't know either. I do know that the SEC to the extent they've waited in in the
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:15.000]   United States has looked at ICOs and things like that and treated them as securities falling within
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:22.840]   the securities laws and wanting to curtail fraud and things around that. But that's different than
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:28.760]   saying you can't buy and sell. And to be clear, it was Binance markets limited and that's not the
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:34.200]   same as Binance.com. In fact, Binance says BML is a separate legal entity that does not offer any
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:41.320]   products or services via the Binance.com website. So Binance.com continues and still, it's got to
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:47.400]   make you a little nervous if you're using Binance to store your Bitcoin in the UK.
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:53.880]   Although, as pointed out in the IRC chat and it's like, I can verify this, Bitcoin's going up again.
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:59.880]   So yeah, we raised $2,000 with this conversation alone. Yeah, people are buying the dip. I mean,
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:04.760]   they always buy the dip, right? It's all going to work out.
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.960]   Dip coin. That's the... Well, I'm coming up with dip coin.
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:14.520]   Dip coin. Everyone's going to buy it. Buy the dip. I love it. That's the slogan.
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:17.320]   At least it's original. It's not a dog meme. Yeah.
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:24.760]   Don't knock the doge, man. Don't knock the doge. All right, I was going to do the...
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:29.720]   I think I was going to mention Facebook launching live audio rooms and podcasts. Who cares? I don't
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:35.400]   care. I don't care. So I mentioned it. I did it. There's the story. Read about it if you want.
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:41.400]   I think we should wrap this up. It has been so much fun to hang out with you guys. Denise Howell,
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:46.280]   I miss you. Love having you on the network. Whenever you can give us some time, it's really great to
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:49.400]   have you. Denise Howell.info, is her website anything you want to plug?
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:54.200]   Yeah, if you don't mind. I launched my little business that I've mentioned on
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:17:00.440]   Twitter before. I don't know about you guys, but I've found it even more difficult to get out of
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:06.680]   the house and sort of put yourself together in a way that bears public scrutiny after the pandemic.
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:13.240]   Like some of us have lost those skills entirely. So to assist you with that. And also to assist
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:20.360]   the planet. I started a little business called Fits with Fits, which is using sustainable,
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:25.240]   pre-loved clothing that is pre-styled for you. So you can turn yourself out. Hopefully
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:30.360]   Leo and others have told me over the years they like the way I put things together. So I'm putting
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:36.120]   things together for you. So if you go to Fits with Fits.com, you can possibly pick up something
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:41.320]   for yourself or a gift for someone else. I've tried very hard to make things pretty size neutral so
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:44.440]   that you can buy one of these sets. It would even fit me.
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:58.200]   They're more aimed at women. So women. So I get it right. F-I-T-S. F-I-T-S. W-I-T-H. F-I-T-S.
[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:05.320]   Fits with Fits. Yes. And this comes from your Instagram, which is, as I've said many times,
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:12.200]   so fun because you pose in your outfit of the day, all of which acquired its secondhand stores.
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:18.760]   That's so great. And so you've now made this a little business. And you know what? At least it's
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:24.760]   going to be thrilled because every time your name comes up, she says, "I love how she dresses. I love
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:31.880]   how she looks. We've always enjoyed your eclectic look and now you can be participating with this."
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:37.640]   Yeah, it's fun. It lets me experience the business considerations that my clients are always
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:43.000]   wailing to me about. It lets me kick the tires on long-time sponsors here like Squarespace.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.320]   And that's a good honor. I love it. Well, what's great is,
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:53.880]   lately I've been thinking a lot about sustainability. And the biggest problem we have in this world is
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:58.040]   we're a consumer culture. We buy stuff, we throw it away, but buy more stuff, we throw it away.
[02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:03.800]   This is the ultimate recycling. I think this is very good for the world.
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:12.120]   Circular fashion. Circular fashion. FITS with FITS.com. And you get what monthly drops?
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:17.560]   Or seasonal? No, seasonal. Yeah, so the spring/summer drop is live now.
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:24.120]   Very nice. 21 outfits for summer 21. How do you get 21 of anything?
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:28.280]   I mean, how do you get that? They're all different or I don't understand.
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:31.800]   They're all different. Yeah, each one of these is a set of four pieces, usually four.
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:34.040]   I see. So once somebody buys it, it's gone forever.
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:36.760]   Yes. Got it. One of a kind.
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:40.920]   I like that tie. The Norman Rockwell tie.
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:48.920]   All right. Father's day is over, so it's too late, unfortunately for me.
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:52.920]   Thank you, Denise. Great to see you. Congratulations on the new business. That's wonderful.
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:59.080]   Thanks. Daniel Robino is executive editor at Windows Central. Always a great place to get
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:06.200]   the latest Windows news. Anything you want to mention? It's going to be a busy year. Windows 11
[02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:10.360]   obviously is going to be big. So we're going to have plenty of guides explaining all the new
[02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:16.840]   features, how to upgrade your PC, and just a lot of content around that, as well as Xbox and gaming.
[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:25.160]   So we're very excited for the rest of the year. Yeah. I ended up getting a Dell Alienware gaming
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:29.240]   machine, but now I'm starting to look at laptops. And so I'm going to get a Windows 11 laptop.
[02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:34.280]   I'll have to check out your reviews to find out which one I should get.
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:39.560]   There's a lot of good stuff out there, actually, and more coming. A lot of good stuff. HP is
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:45.240]   doing the best right now, in my opinion. You like the HP? The Specters or the Elite Book?
[02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:52.520]   Specter 14 is just a phenomenal laptop. It's got OLED, 4K, it's a convertible pen support,
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:57.080]   really nice keyboard. But they're all doing well. Actually, Dell, Lenovo also making
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:03.800]   credible machines and now Razer is involved with non-gaming laptops. So they're all easy to recommend.
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:05.160]   I had the first spec-
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:06.920]   That's the copper one. I really loved it. Yes.
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:09.080]   Not the 360 or the-
[02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:09.400]   Yeah, 14 knows.
[02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:14.600]   Yeah, the X14, the one you just showed is phenomenal.
[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:21.640]   Yeah, I really like the design, the style of these. HP's transformed their business because
[02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:26.120]   they used to be the Junkware Kings. They would load more crap on their computers than anybody.
[02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:31.080]   But I think when they spun off HPE, whatever they call it,
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:37.160]   suddenly they got more focused on the PC side and it's really good, really good stuff.
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:42.440]   Oh, now you got- maybe I'm going to have to pull out the credit card. I thought I'd be buying an
[02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:48.520]   Apple laptop by now, but no. Get the OLED model. That's all. Oh, I love OLED.
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:54.040]   I love OLED. Bad battery life though, probably. Yeah, it's all right. It's not bad at all.
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:59.080]   Still looks good. That's the most important thing. How's it run Linux? That's all I really care about.
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:01.000]   I think-
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:05.800]   Yeah, it should run Linux just fine. I know some of the HP and some of the Dell laptops you can
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:10.680]   order with Linux. Yes, yeah, yeah. I have a Dell XPS 13. It came with Ubuntu.
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:19.160]   Yeah, love it. Mr. Ed Bot, the Ed Bot report on ZDNet, my old buddy. Anything you'd like to plug
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:24.600]   these days? Well, you know, you start a fashion business? I think that might be a good idea.
[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:30.200]   No, I'm not going to try and compete there. All right. I'm not going to try and compete there.
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:38.280]   But when this week's announcements were coming out, I thought that I'd be talking to my publisher
[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:43.080]   about doing Windows 11 inside out. And of course, I will be-
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:43.880]   That's the book.
[02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:49.000]   ... for them next week. But Windows 10 inside out for the edition looks like it's going to
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:53.560]   have a little more life than I thought. Yes, that's right. So, run out and buy that one.
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:58.680]   Run it out. Is it on Amazon? Are you self-published? Where is-
[02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:01.000]   Where can I find it? It's on Amazon. It's published-
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:08.120]   It's under the Microsoft Press label, but it's Pearson that actually publishes that license.
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:09.000]   Oh, I know those guys.
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:17.400]   Microsoft Press label. And it's the fourth edition, the fourth print edition, but it's the seventh
[02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:19.960]   action edition that we've done. Wow.
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:25.560]   And I think we really- Well, it's the most secure edition we've ever done.
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:26.360]   Wow.
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:29.480]   Is that how I'm supposed to- It's the most- It's the thinnest book we've ever written.
[02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:33.080]   No, no, no, that's not right. Definitely wrong. It's the most secure.
[02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:38.200]   That's good. I think- No, but I think it's- I think we've got a lot of really great content
[02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:46.040]   in there. And it's aimed at people who already know Windows, but there's just things in Windows
[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:49.800]   10 that you just don't notice until someone points them out to you.
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:49.800]   Right.
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:54.360]   And that was sort of our mission with this edition. And I think we did a great job.
[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:55.640]   Nice. Nice.
[02:23:55.640 --> 02:24:00.200]   Thank you, Ed. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Denise.
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:05.720]   Thank you all for joining us. We do Twitch every Sunday, right after the tech guy.
[02:24:05.720 --> 02:24:09.000]   Now, a little programming note next Sunday is the fourth of July.
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.280]   I hear that in the United States, that's a big holiday.
[02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:14.520]   We don't want our people to work on the fourth of July.
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:19.000]   So we're going to do Twitch on Saturday instead on July 3rd.
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:26.120]   So if you like to watch live, little programming note, same time, which is 2130 UTC. That's 2.30
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:33.240]   pm Pacific, 5.30 Eastern. So next time it'll be Saturday from then on Sunday at that time.
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:38.760]   You can watch us live at twitch.tv/live. There's live audio and video feeds.
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:43.800]   If you're doing that chat at irc.tuit.tv, those are all the people watching live or if you're a member
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:49.640]   of Club Twitch in our Club Twitch discord. After the fact on demand versions of this show and every
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:54.040]   show we do available in a variety of places, of course, every show has a YouTube channel.
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:58.440]   But on the website, twitch.tv, you'll find a link to that YouTube channel.
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:04.920]   You'll also find the links you can use to subscribe at a podcast player, including just the plain
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:08.840]   old RSS feed. That's probably the best way to get it. That way you get it automatically.
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:14.520]   And if your podcast player offers a review section, please leave us a five star review.
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:19.560]   Spread the word. Let others know about this week in tech. We've been around a long time,
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:25.240]   but believe it or not, there's still some people have never heard of Twitch. Don't forget we are
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:32.680]   going on an Alaska Cruise in 2022. If you'd like to join us in July, a Twitch Cruise is going to be
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:43.080]   a lot of fun. Some great people are coming along. Find out more at cruis.tuit.tv. We figured July
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:48.200]   2022, things should have settled down a little bit. I don't go up and see the salmon and the
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:54.600]   grizzly bears and have a great time. The glaciers cruis.tuit.tv. I look forward to it.
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:26:01.080]   Lisa and I'll be on that cruise. I think we're getting close to the number of signups. I think
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:05.160]   it's close to 60, which means we can add another host. We're going to see which
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:10.040]   Maria Steve gives and he says, "Lori won't let me go on cruises, but maybe we can talk him into
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:16.520]   it." Anyway, we'll let you know when we invite additional hosts. That's about it for the show.
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:21.320]   Thank you everybody for being here. We'll see you next week. Remember, Saturday, July 3rd for the
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:24.840]   live show. Another Twitch. It's in the can. Bye bye.
