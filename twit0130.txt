[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   >> Here, actually recording this a little bit early,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I realized our normal record time Sunday afternoon
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   was not going to be ideal this week.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I guess there's an all football game going on or something like that.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   So we're taping a little early with a different kind of crew
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   because Devorax on Trute and Transit.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Patrick Norton's at the, believe it or not,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   this is not a joke at the farmer's market.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   But good news, I can't imagine a better couple of people
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   to talk about the hot news today.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Jason Calicanis of Mahalo, hey Jason.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   >> Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   >> Oh, great to have you and of course Robert Skobel,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   fresh from Davos.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   >> Yeah, it's a great honor to be here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   >> Yeah, honor.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And Fast Company, congratulations on the new gig.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   >> Hey, thank you.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Fun for a couple of weeks so far.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   >> No kidding.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   So Jason, you're pretty happy about your Giants.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   >> I'm pretty happy about the Giants.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I think we got a good chance tomorrow of competing.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I mean, that last game of the season,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   we led the game for a couple of quarters.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So it's going to be a great game.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   >> Yeah, it's going to be a great game.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   >> Yeah, it's going to be a great game.

[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   >> Yeah, I think Robert's a unique talent and I have a great way of negotiating with him.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I just see his wife.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   >> Mary Ann says, "Take the job, take the job."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   >> Like, you know that Jason, he's a smart fella.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Consider it.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   >> That's a good, I have to remember that, Jason.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Only negotiate with married guys.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   >> I always--
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   >> And the other thing I do is I always just tell people, like, at the very least, let me hear out what I have to offer because then you can at least bring it back to the perfect job if there's something better for you.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And tell them to pay you more because Calla Canis is willing to overpay.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   >> There you go.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> And everybody knows I always do overpay for talent.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> Yeah, you're famous for that, yeah.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   >> And I know, you know, I tell you, scored big with Veronica Mahalo Daily is incredible.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   It is-- you know, clearly there's a lot of writers behind the scenes too.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   >> We have five people including Veronica working on the show, so it's a pretty significant staff.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   >> Makes a difference.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   >> You know, there are 30, 40,000 views per show in three months.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   You know, I gave him the goal of hitting 100,000 views per show by the end of year one.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   They're going to hit it in the second quarter, I think.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> That's awesome.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   That's fantastic.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   >> Yeah, her show is actually entertaining.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   >> Isn't it?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   >> I'm not sure mine's going to be that entertaining.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> Well, you have a different thing going on.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I mean, it's all about, first of all, it's all about the fact that you're doing it with a cell phone.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   The funniest thing-- and then Merlin Mann was giving you a hard time.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   The funniest thing is you're using-- and you did it to me at Macworld right before you went to Davos.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   >> And it surprised me.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   You hold up a Nokia N90 find and you say, "And by the way, we're streaming live on the Internet right now."
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And there's usually a bunch of people watching, which makes a lot of fun.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   >> Oh, cool.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   >> And makes my interviews a lot better, by the way.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   >> Well, but you also get the stunned looks, especially at Davos.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   People go, "What?"
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   >> Yeah, there were a few of those looks of--
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   >> What?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   >> They didn't realize you could broadcast a video off of a cell phone.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   >> I didn't know.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   You surprised me.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Do they feel like they were being ambushed?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> Definitely not there because I was pretty careful about making sure that, you know, I could film them.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Because, yeah, people like that, you got to be careful.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> Although, I had a few people who didn't realize what I was up there.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   >> So, is that kind of-- how you're going to do it?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Are you going to go back to the old, you know, big camera?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   >> I'm doing two shows, one will be with the cell phone and interactivity.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Because the neat thing about the cell phone isn't really that you're broadcasting live, although that's pretty cool.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   But the audience can participate in the interview while we're going on.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   >> A chat.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   >> And that makes the interview a lot more fun and a lot better to tell you the truth.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I interviewed some brain researchers in Davos.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And I really don't know the questions to ask, you know, a brain researcher.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But people were posting links to--
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   >> So, you're watching these things on the phone while you're taping?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   >> Yes.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   If you-- if you watch a quick video, you can-- when you check-- when you comment, the comment goes to the phone while you're filming.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And that's what's really killer because it makes the interviewer smarter, you know, because the audience that's watching, sort of like the power of crowds.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> Interesting.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> And--
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   >> You only really get it if you try to do it yourself.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   But once you start doing interviews with an audience watching live and you're interacting with that audience, then you realize, wow, that's-- you're getting better questions because of that.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I was asking questions off my cell phone, you know, from people around the world.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And interacting plus, you know, like when I interviewed Yossi Bardi, Jeff Pover was on the phone.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   >> That's really--
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   >> And we're just asking questions.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And it just brings a lot more into the conversation than just one person.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   >> And what you didn't mention was when you start broadcasting, it sends a tweet to your Twitter saying, I am broadcasting live.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   >> So--
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   >> It's different now.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I have to hit 55 on my phone, but as soon as I hit 55 on my phone, it sends a message to Twitter saying, you know, "--"
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   >> Oh, so you can pick when you do it when you don't?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   >> Yeah, like today I was coming in a bomb a lunch and I didn't send a Twitter.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It was kind of spamming Twitter for a while.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I was like, oh, come on.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Every five minutes.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   The other problem--
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   >> The reason that was happening a lot was if the Wi-Fi went away and my connection got dropped, then I'd have to restart it.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And it would send another Twitter.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   >> And like I filmed the concert on Saturday night and my Wi-Fi went away four times.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So it sent four Twitters for the--
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   >> Ah.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   >> That really pissed people out.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   >> Of course.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   >> Had the same thing at the DLD conference when I was doing it.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It really is like William Gibson had mentioned in one of his books this like thing called "God's Little Machine" and it was like a--
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I remember correctly, like a little Zeppelin that flew about 10 feet over your head.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   >> [laughs]
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   >> And it was like GPS coded to you.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   So like if you were walking down the street, there might be people with these little, you know, Zeppelin floating above their heads with cameras,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   life casting them, and recording their entire life, putting it on a shared server on the web so that at any point you could pull up any moment in a person's life.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   >> And that's what this is.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And it's different than Justin TV because that requires a whole rig and you know, this is just like, oh, I met somebody interesting, I'll turn it on.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   >> It's amazing.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   You could do it with an N95.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   It's mostly Nokia phones.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   This is qik.com, as to say.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And there'll be several competitors within a couple months.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   >> I think so.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   >> And within a month, I think Seismic is going to be doing it any day now.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   >> Well, the quick already sends video from Quack over to Seismic, which is really interesting.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   So everybody who follows me on Seismic gets the video as well.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   >> I got, by the way, I should mention like two top Twitterers of all.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Robert's number two is the number one human with 6,866 followers.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Jason's number seven with 6,528.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   >> Damn, Jason, catch it up.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   >> Hey, never going to catch him.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   >> Oh, you're close.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   You're close.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   You're only close.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   >> If I was in my readership, I would be sitting ahead.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   >> What the hell's that sound?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Who's got?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   >> Is that you, Robert?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   What is that?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   >> That's not me.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   >> Sounds like television in the background.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   >> Oh, it's quick.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   >> Oh, it's quick.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   >> I opened the quick website.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   >> Yeah, it all launches very weird.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   >> That's not good.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   >> I'll tell you something.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   You know, like we were talking about on that other show, the value of someone like Robert
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Scoble to accompany.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   >> That's right.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   >> Robert Scoble owns his audience.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   >> You know, like, you know, offense to Podtech, but if he had previously been working at CNET
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   or like when you guys worked at Tech TV, right, you guys all had to scramble and restart your
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   enterprise, right?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And now what's happened is Robert seamlessly brought his audience over to Fast Company.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   So when he negotiated his deal with Fast Company, as I was saying, you know, each of those people
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   is worth a dollar, I think, you know, per year.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   So he's got whatever, or maybe two or three, 7,000 people on Twitter, 5,000 people on Facebook.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   >> My desktop just paid what a few, more than 1,000 people.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   >> Let's get to that.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   That's the story, and that's the reason you two are on.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I couldn't think of anybody better to get on.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I mean, you guys, this is a fascinating story and controversial.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Microsoft, essentially a hostile takeover bid 44.6 million in cash and stock for billion.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Do I say, with a B?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   >> Yes.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   >> For Yahoo.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Now, of course, rumors have been flying for the last two years that Microsoft might take
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   a stake in Yahoo, but this is an out and out attempt to buy the whole kitten kaboodle.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   You're sitting on the sidelines.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   You probably know better than anybody what's going on right now.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   What do you think?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   >> Well, the piece of this that's the most important is the advertising.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And so if you look at the advertising space, search marketing, direct search inventory
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   is the greatest advertising inventory on the planet right now.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   It's the most profitable and the most desirable.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And we may have talked about this before, but the reason is pretty simple.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   If you're typing, you know, Nokia N95, people listening to the show are typing that into
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Google right now.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   We know they're interested in the Nokia N95.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   That inventory is actually better than in gadgets inventories in some way because if you're
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   reading in gadget, you might be interested in the Nokia N95, but you might not be in the
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   mode to buy it right at that point.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And then, you know, after that comes things like social networking advertising, which would
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   be like, we know that you own a Nokia phone or your friends own it and maybe we're going
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   to try to target it to you.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   That's worth even less.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And so advertisers are flooding to that.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.720]   Yahoo has a big chunk of that, right?
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.400]   Like 20% of that and Microsoft's got 10% of it or whatever.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.760]   So now they can actually have this very big overture slash Microsoft ad center base of
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.520]   advertisers.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.800]   So why is that important?
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   Well, it's very affordable.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.440]   It's a very good business and it's a very profitable business.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.600]   But Microsoft is going through a seed change right now.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   No kidding.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.680]   I mean, they were a software company.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680]   And they still will be.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.200]   The difference is how does that software make money?
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.520]   And for 30 years, they sold it for $99 with your computer or $300 for office or, you know,
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.560]   $5,000 for a server.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.480]   Now what they're faced with is, okay, 90% of people are going to use a free version of
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.840]   office, you know, five, 10 years out.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.360]   And it will reach the corporations at some point and the cost is going to go down.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.920]   So they need to have some sort of advertising monetization engine to have their company
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.640]   shift from being subscription based, i.e. paying every year or two advertising based.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.800]   And so that's really what they're buying.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.520]   And that's the core of the thing.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.800]   I mean, there's other reasons as well.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.360]   If you look at what the main businesses that have been established on the internet for
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.640]   gaining traffic are email, instant message and search, right?
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.880]   So you have Microsoft and Yahoo are, I think, you know, the number one in three player in
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:18.400]   email, one in two in, or one in, I think the one in two in email, one in three in instant
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   messaging.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.960]   So now consolidated, they're by far and away.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.120]   The number one instant message platform and the number one.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.800]   But how do you merge those two communities?
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.560]   You keep them both alive as it's actually very simple.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.800]   It's a great question, but it's, you know, when I had my time at AOL, they consolidated,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.360]   you know, CompuServe email, AOL email, Netscape email, all these different email platforms.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.040]   So what you do is you let people keep their email address.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.920]   You then when you have whatever's next in the upgrade cycle, you know, when Yahoo went
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.600]   from Yahoo mail to the Ajax version to compete with Gmail, which was a guest based on outcast
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600]   or out.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   Yeah, what was it?
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   That was.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.600]   They bought for 30 minutes.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   Outposts, outposts, right.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.840]   So whenever they make that next switch, then you just move those users over and they keep
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.760]   their email box and this is pretty seamless.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   So then when you look at is, then that doesn't have to car year one.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.800]   That can take two or three years and it, if you look at Flickr, Flickr is only grown, right?
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.520]   And now you're logging with your Flickr with your Yahoo.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.320]   As a Flickr user, I don't, I'm nervous about Flickr.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.600]   Let me ask you, Robert, before we start talking about individual properties, is this a smart
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   move for Microsoft?
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:27.280]   Yeah, it gets Microsoft back in the web and makes them a lot more interesting, which they've,
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.480]   you know, they've really not done anything in the web or, you know, they've tried their
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.480]   live services.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.480]   I mean, they've tried.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.720]   They've tried, but they've failed and this gets them back in the web game in a
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.720]   big way.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.040]   You know, I remember being in a meeting and Microsoft where Kevin Johnson came out to
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.440]   our group and he said exactly what Jason just said, which was the advertising market
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.280]   is 10 to 20 times bigger than the software market.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.520]   You know, the selling of software market market is.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.160]   And so he saw that Microsoft was going to make all its future growth at least off of
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.160]   advertising.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.480]   Well, this is a huge play to get them back into the online advertising world, mostly
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:14.280]   with the search, you know, having a decent search engine with millions of users is a
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.000]   big deal that you add that into what they were trying to do with live and they get them
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.640]   back into search in a big way, which they just were completely out of the game.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.040]   I asked Jerry Pournell.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.040]   He was going to join us.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.680]   He's not feeling well as under the weather, but I asked him what he thought he said.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.960]   And I kind of agree with his Microsoft should stick to its knitting, make a better version
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.960]   of Windows.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   They got problems with Vista.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   What are they?
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.400]   They're getting into a new business entirely and I have to say it doesn't look good when
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   you've got Vista, which is a complete flop.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.480]   If I'm a Microsoft stockholder, I'm not sure I'm happy about this.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.080]   I mean, it's a different company now.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.960]   So I guess the thinking is if you're failing at one of your two core competencies, should
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   you take on a third?
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   Right.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.160]   And that is a valid argument.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.600]   So especially since neither Microsoft nor Yahoo is the leader in search.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.520]   I mean, everything Microsoft's done in the last two years looks like they're chasing
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.280]   to try to play catch up with Google.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.600]   But you know what the other thing is, is Yahoo, Microsoft, Yahoo and Microsoft are the
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.760]   leaders and AOL ahead of Google and email and it's the messaging and some other things.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.760]   They're bigger than Google.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.760]   Combined they are.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   No, no, individually.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.760]   They're bigger than Gmail.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.800]   Gmail's got no users.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   Really?
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   Nothing compared to Hotmail.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   I had no idea.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.880]   Yahoo, mail and yeah, because well, those things take a long time to get people to switch off
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.880]   of them.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   The switching cost is high.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.080]   Instant messaging and email, high switching cost.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.720]   So, um, yeah, Google's not a player and I am at all.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.360]   No, AOL's the dominant I am player, obviously.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:54.160]   I mean, you know, people have to, it's very easy to look at Google and get intimidated
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   because of the growth.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.720]   But you have to remember, they're really only number one in two businesses.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.600]   The advertising network that they have in search advertising and search itself, everything
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.200]   else, they're not even a player.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:11.120]   And so, you know, if you can compete with them on the two things they are, you don't
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   have to beat them necessarily.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.760]   You just have to be competitive and you're in the game.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.560]   You know, it's sort of like you don't have to have perfect special teams or perfect defense
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.080]   if you have, you know, these other things.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.480]   So, it's okay to be number two.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.280]   It could be fine for, um, Microsoft being number two, it could be just fine for Microsoft.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.080]   And keep in mind when you say failure on VISTA, how many tens of millions?
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.360]   They sold 100 million copies of VISTA, but this is why I consider it a failure.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   They sold 250 million PCs that year.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.560]   So, 150 million people are buying XP or something like this.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.720]   Yeah, but it was like I met Michael Dell at Dallas and I met the CEO of Lenovo and both
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:54.280]   of them said, "Come on, be realistic, you're going to buy VISTA because it comes on our
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.280]   machines."
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.280]   Well, that's the point is that people are...
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.200]   You know, even if Apple doubles or triple its market share, which it did in the last,
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:07.720]   you know, 18 months, it's still a very small player in terms of the number of machines
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   sold.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.400]   So, you're going to buy VISTA, whether it's a failure or not.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.720]   And that's why how Microsoft looks at it internally.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.720]   You're going to buy...
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.720]   You can't lose.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   You know, they're going to sell 100 million copies of VISTA.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720]   You know, in a year.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.720]   And so, where are they going to get any growth?
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.720]   That's depressing.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.880]   That's Microsoft saying, "Yeah, it's okay.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   It sucks.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.880]   Big deal.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.880]   We're going to get the business anyway."
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.880]   Yeah, but it is refreshing.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.040]   Well, you have to define what a failure is, right?
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.720]   So, I mean, we're saying VISTA is a failure.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.520]   You know, it's maybe not as huge a success as it should be.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.960]   Maybe it's not as good as OS 10.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.840]   You know, obviously it's not.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   But they have time to fix it.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.720]   I mean, Microsoft always puts out, you know, schlocky stuff and then all of a sudden,
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.720]   you know, gets better.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.280]   It's not like the first version of Windows they've done, Jason.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.280]   Come on.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   Exactly.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   Well, listen, I'm not saying it's forgivable.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.680]   I mean, it is kind of shocking.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   But you know what?
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.960]   I have to say, a big part of it.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.520]   I always believe that the, you know, leadership, you know, from the top is a big determinant
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.880]   in, you know, the success of companies and specific products.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:12.280]   And I don't think that VISTA being a failure on a, you know, technological basis, on a,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:19.360]   you know, reviewer basis is not, is because it was launched during the transition of
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.360]   Bill leaving.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.360]   Right.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.640]   And now if, you know, some of these new people, you know, take over and have 100% ownership
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.400]   of it, I think you may, and that's not like fault to Gates.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   It's just the way it is.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.840]   You know, it's hard to stay focused like that.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.920]   I guess I'm out the door.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:37.360]   So, but if you're buying stock, do you buy stock in Microsoft now or do you worry that
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.320]   Microsoft is a new business and let's wait and see.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.840]   I mean, it sounds like it's a new business.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:53.320]   I, I, I think over the next two or three years, Google far out runs the Microsoft Yahoo group.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   Microsoft and Yahoo getting together are going to have a lot of trouble integrating.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.440]   And it's going to be a year before, first of all, they're going to have to get this deal
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.880]   approved by the governmental agencies, right?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.920]   Not just the US, the EU, which is hostile.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.080]   You know, which, so let's say, let's say they do get it passed because neither, neither
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.160]   Microsoft nor Yahoo have a monopoly in search.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.360]   It's still going to be, you know, six months before that happens.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.600]   And then it's going to be another six months before these groups really get together and
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   gel.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.240]   I remember when I got a job at Microsoft, it took me six months just to figure out, you
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:32.040]   know, how to work with people and which, which people were important to work with and how
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.520]   to, you know, where, what I should be doing there.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.080]   And then all of a sudden my career started taking off.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.640]   It's going to be a year before these groups get together and really understand each other.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.560]   And before the executives can really figure out which, like, you know, Hotmail has what,
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.640]   250 million people on email.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.320]   And Yahoo mail has 300 million active users.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.400]   Which team wins out of that?
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.480]   And which engineer goes where?
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.520]   And man, that's a lot of work to figure those things out.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.120]   And then there's going to be culture clashes and political fights.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:10.200]   And, you know, Yahoo is down here in Silicon Valley and Microsoft has a real strong headquarters
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   culture.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.600]   So if you're not up in the headquarters, you're going to feel left out eventually and you're
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.560]   going to get pissed or you're going to have to move up to Redmond to figure it out.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.080]   Or you're going to have to travel a lot up there.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.600]   There's going to be, you know, a year to 18 month period for these companies really to
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.360]   figure out each other and work together to really get something going.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   And in the meantime, Google's going to just keep running.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.280]   And the real growth market right now is mobile and Google is firing on at least seven of
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.880]   its eight cylinders on mobile.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   And you're going to start.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.480]   Except they haven't been a penny from it yet.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.480]   So, yeah, I know.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   But they're going to end up.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.480]   I'm looking at the growth and the stock market cares about growth.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.120]   They don't care about what happened.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.160]   And I think it's safe to say Google will make money on low.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.000]   So, from what I'm hearing inside Google, the growth on mobile is just astounding.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.400]   It's outpacing all of their expectations.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:13.840]   So I remember when Microsoft used to talk like that, that kind of talk turned into quarterly
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.160]   profits, you know, within one or two quarters.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:22.120]   And I expect Google is going to be the one that owned out of this thing.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.560]   Let me say, certainly the market agrees with me.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:30.080]   Microsoft went down, you know, 10% or 5% yesterday, something like that.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.600]   So, but we're making one assumption, which is that the Yahoo board will accept the offer.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.440]   Jason, do you think it's a given?
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.800]   I mean, it's a 62% premium over Yahoo's stock price, closing price on Thursday.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.360]   A deal is going to get done.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.560]   The question is at what price, right?
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.720]   Because they may have to increase the offer.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.560]   And with who?
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.120]   It's not, Microsoft put in a very aggressive offer and, you know, again, going back to
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.920]   like the principles and these companies and, you know, the hedge fund, the, you know, the
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.580]   investors who own a lot of money in it, et cetera, you know, they're going to like the
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.840]   idea of making 50, 60% of money overnight.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.520]   And they're going to want to bank that because it might take Yahoo a couple of years to actually
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   get that kind of growth.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   Right.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520]   If ever, Yahoo's not exactly.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   And it's a downside risk.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   And it's huge, exactly.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.240]   It's huge downside risk.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.800]   So you could lose money.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.000]   So people are going to want to take the deal.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   It's a very rich deal.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.400]   Now, how about a white knight?
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   Could we see some?
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   That's the thing is I think that there's yet what could happen here.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.480]   There's two or three scenarios.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.360]   There are other players like News Corp and hedge funds who could try to make a run at
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.880]   it's really, it's pretty.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880]   That's a lot of money.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   It's big.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:46.360]   I mean, News Corp could pull it off and they could certainly pull it off with another partner.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.640]   And the thing that will be interesting though is what Google might do and nobody's really
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.280]   talked about this yet.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:59.920]   But Google and Yahoo have talked about in the past, you know, giving Yahoo's search advertising
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.520]   business over to Google.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:10.440]   So what if Google bought Yahoo's search business for $10 billion, which is the increase in,
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.000]   you know, what we see in the Microsoft deal and Yahoo said we're going to try a bunch of
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.400]   other businesses, content and services, et cetera.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:25.280]   And we're going to, you know, give our search business over to Google and then, you know,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.120]   that that would be a bigger regulatory issue, obviously.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.080]   Would the shareholders go for that?
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.760]   Well, that would give you the blend of get the money, get some, get some money and get
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.360]   some upside in the company still there.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.240]   So, but I think the Microsoft deal is going to get done.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.640]   It just feels like they're determined.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:47.880]   And also, I mean, Jerry Yang has been at it for what now, 94, 95, we started the thing
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.600]   or whatever, 12 years in.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   It's tired.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   He might want to go.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.640]   He increases, I think his personal stake and David Fowler's personal stake went up a
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.840]   billion dollars that day.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.960]   So, you know, it makes sense for them to get out now.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.800]   You know, WebLogz Inc joined AOL after the AOL time Warner merger.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.040]   But did you see culture clashes though when you came in?
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.040]   How difficult was it working with time Warner?
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.120]   There's things I can say and there's things I can't.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.440]   What I can say is I was outside of the main organization, but there was definitely a dynamic
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.280]   there that's been pretty well documented in a lot of different publications.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.480]   And there always is a dynamic like that.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   However, I think people like Robert who are in the thick of it, like Robert is actually
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.880]   when he was at Microsoft, correct me if I'm wrong, was actually doing work.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.000]   And so he would be like, oh my God, it's a lot of work.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.960]   Yeah, but to guys like me, not that I'm like CEO of Microsoft Yahoo, but guys who are in
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.160]   the CEO slot are looking at it going, yeah, it's a lot of work, but I don't actually
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.160]   have to do that work.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.600]   You've got people to do that.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   Exactly.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.320]   And all it is is like you sit in a meeting, you've done this, like you sit in a meeting
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.880]   and you say, okay, give me the three proposals of how we're going to consolidate Hotmail
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   and Yahoo mail.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   Okay.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   This one seems like it makes the most sense.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   Mail.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   Mail seems easy.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.880]   What happens to Flickr?
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.000]   Well, I mean Yahoo, the great thing for Yahoo, I think in the last couple of years is
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.200]   they learned how to buy things and not destroy them.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   Right.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.560]   Delicious and Flickr are good examples.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.280]   And Weblogs, it would be a good example at AOL and there's other examples, MySpace
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.920]   at News Corp.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.200]   A lot of these big companies realize, you know what, our managers are going to screw
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.760]   these things up, let them run themselves.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.600]   But then the founders go away and that's what's going to happen here at Yahoo and they take
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.440]   a lot of brain with them and momentum.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.760]   But then again, Yahoo had an ability, I think Yahoo just had, they get in their ass kicked
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.160]   by Google every day and then they have an identity crisis, you know.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.960]   Are they a content company, are they a services company, are they doing display advertising,
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.240]   search advertising, just, they felt like they were all over the place and you can really
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:54.800]   only be great at one, maybe two things, you know, as a company and Microsoft and Google,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   perfect examples of that.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   eBay, perfect example of that.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.160]   eBay is good at two things, auctions and PayPal, that's it.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:09.040]   In terms of Flickr, the places where it would go off the rails is if Microsoft forced the
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:15.400]   team to translate from Linux over to Windows, which they did with Hotmail and it caused
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.880]   Hotmail a lot of trouble.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:23.480]   I don't think the culture is there anymore to have that kind of strategy tax, but you
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.680]   never know, you know, if somebody gets it up there.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.320]   Yahoo has a number of money to go to Windows.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   Yahoo has a number of small but important open source projects like the Yahoo user interface
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   system, which they've been giving away and a lot of people use it and things like that.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.920]   I kind of think if they go to Microsoft, Microsoft's going to say, "What is this?"
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:48.680]   The place I'm more worried is I'm sure there's going to be pressure to monetize Flickr and
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.680]   I'm not sure there's a good way to monetize Flickr.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.760]   Flickr is a big money loser from what I hear from you.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   It absolutely is.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.680]   It's a crown jewel in terms of a brand, but it hasn't made money.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.600]   How do you put ads into a photo stream without pissing off your user?
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.960]   That's going to be a tough thing for Flickr to do.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.840]   Actually, one of the bright spots about Microsoft is in their research team, they have some
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.960]   really great people doing photographic research.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.680]   Both in China and in the red me.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.040]   There's some neat stuff in the labs.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.640]   Oh, they have amazing stuff with photography.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.040]   The photos sent back, I gave a demo of the year in 2006.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.200]   It was the best demo I'd ever seen.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.760]   How do you turn that research into products that people can use and get excited about?
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:45.120]   Flickr certainly has that kind of cache with the community that we're really scared that
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.200]   Microsoft would come in and screw it up.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:53.240]   There's a couple of other deals that went on that we probably should mention Etsy, which
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.120]   is a site that does handmade goods, which I love.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.120]   It's a great site.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.120]   It's a craft site.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.400]   It's raised $27 million.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.880]   It's a stunning amount of money.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.000]   I don't know if crafts are the next big thing, but boy, somebody thinks so.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.880]   Any thoughts either of you?
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.680]   You ever use Etsy?
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.600]   Your wives use Etsy, trust me.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.100]   I have it.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.540]   It isn't a lot of money.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.700]   Here's the deal of the century.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.900]   Amazon buys Audible for $300 million.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.540]   Ain't how Audible, that's a good company.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.540]   There's a good company.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.980]   I tell you, how much I use Audible.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.180]   They sponsor the show.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.340]   There's still sponsors.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.340]   The funniest thing.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.100]   The day before the deal goes through, I get an email from Audible's agency saying how
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.100]   much they love us.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.340]   They're going to stay on through all 2008 and all the shows.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.340]   Next day I read the headlines.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.660]   It's like, okay, well, we'll see what happens now.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:51.980]   Until that deal goes through, which is at least Q2, Audible is still a sponsor.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.820]   But that makes sense when you look at the candle.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.500]   I think that's a great synergy, actually.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.420]   Yeah, it makes a lot of sense when you see the Kindle.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.660]   Kindle already plays Audible audio.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:06.140]   Yeah, but it makes sense when you start thinking about their strategy there.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:13.100]   Look at their move well into the electronic book world.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.700]   I'm sure that Kindle is not the last device we're going to see from Amazon.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.700]   No, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.140]   Why not have both or all three, the print version, the electronic text version and the
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.540]   audio version of every book published?
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.020]   Why not?
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:32.700]   And subscription-based services to underwrite the cost of the Kindle, which is high.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.060]   You know, they, I think Audible had a subscription program.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.060]   They still do.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.060]   Yeah, they still do, right?
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.060]   You subscribe and get like you take out one.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.740]   It's a monthly thing and you get credit, certain number of credits.
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.580]   That's a highly profitable business for them, I'm sure.
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.420]   And there was actually this audio book.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.700]   I'm trying to remember the name of it, but there was a Netflix of audio books and I was
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.980]   subscribed to it for a year and I really enjoyed it because you know, you just get to, you
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.500]   know, keep rotating and that stuff.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.500]   Right.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:04.660]   You know, and that, those kind of services, it seems to me like with the cracking down on,
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:10.780]   with the combination of cracking down on people, stealing stuff on BitTorrent, et cetera,
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:17.420]   combined with a reasonable price and the wireless devices, you're going to have this
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:22.620]   great resurgence, I think, in people subscribing to this kind of content, which they haven't.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.660]   I mean, everybody subscribes to their cable television, but nobody subscribes to music,
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.660]   right?
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.380]   But all these people I know are getting Sonos and the reason they're getting Sonos is not
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.820]   just the Sonos, that's half of it.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.820]   It's Rhapsody, right?
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.820]   That comes with it.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.580]   So like they're like, look, I can play any song I want.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.580]   Any song, yeah.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.180]   You just detail that monthly fee.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.500]   Yeah, it's genius.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.820]   And so, I mean, that's what I'm waiting for with iTunes and, you know, why do you think
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:51.420]   that people prefer iTunes prefer to buy than the subscription services like Rhapsody?
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.420]   It's a habit.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.500]   They're just used to the idea of owning music.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.780]   People used to go to Blockbuster and not pay for HBO, right?
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.780]   And then this took people a while.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.780]   Yeah, I make sense.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.140]   Remember people renting VHS tapes?
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.340]   I mean, it was a weird thing in the 80s.
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.580]   It was like, there was a whole culture around going to the video store.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.180]   You remember, like, and strategizing?
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.020]   Right.
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.780]   When you went, you want to go on Thursday?
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.580]   You want to go at three o'clock releases?
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.940]   Like when do people return the latest releases?
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.180]   People will be waiting at the desk.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.180]   You know, what came back?
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.180]   What came back?
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.660]   You know, oh, three movies just came back, which ones were?
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.180]   They may have, you know, sort of wait in the queue there.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.980]   You know, it's interesting that whole culture is gone.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.660]   Do you subscribe, Jason, to music or do you buy?
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.420]   I buy music on iTunes and...
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.180]   I buy a lot on Amazon now, actually, because of the lack of DRM.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.340]   I'm going to start doing that because I hate this DRM.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.340]   I have to like...
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.340]   Yeah, the DRM is crazy.
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:43.140]   I'm constantly losing my music because I replaced my laptop literally every six, 12 months.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.380]   Like, I just got the Air, the Jesus book, by the way.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.460]   Did you get it?
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.460]   I got it.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.460]   I've had it for like three days.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.460]   And?
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.020]   This thing is unbelievable.
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.420]   Anybody who thinks it has any downside is absolutely kidding themselves.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.340]   There is zero downside to this device.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.340]   Zero.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.940]   What makes it so cool besides this size?
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.540]   I was sitting on my couch watching the Nick game and I usually sit there with either
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.220]   my black MacBook, right?
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.860]   Or I have the little Sony tiny one.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.140]   The Sony tiny one, the screen is too tiny.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.420]   The keys are too tiny.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.980]   And I can't really put out a thousand more blog posts without my hands hurting.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.860]   The bigger one is heavy and hot.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:23.660]   And you know, it's just huge that MacBook, the black one.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:29.900]   This thing has the lightness of the Sony Vio tiny ones combined with the Mac OS.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.900]   It's a beautiful screen.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.900]   Full, beautiful screen.
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.900]   Yeah, that LED battery.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.260]   Full, beautiful keyboard.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.340]   That feels like you're on a 24 inch monitor or something.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.060]   And it's so light that when you put it in your bag, you'll pick up your bag and say,
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.220]   oh, I forgot my laptop.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.340]   Open your bag up and it will be in there.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.060]   Still sit on your bag because the thing will snap.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.060]   It feels, I don't know.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.220]   It feels kind of sturdy actually.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:54.900]   When you close it, it feels like it's like a, it feels like a, just a piece of metal.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.900]   Like one piece of metal.
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.260]   And the price is going to come down and you know, the.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.700]   The driver driving my only say, 80 gigs.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.700]   Oh man.
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.700]   It doesn't, you know what?
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.700]   You don't put all your music on it.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.700]   You don't put all your photos on it.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:07.700]   I know.
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.980]   I'm getting trained by Steve Jobs to accept smaller, smaller spaces for all my.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.660]   It's funny because I just bought a MacBook with 250 gigs because I wanted all that space.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:18.820]   I want the space.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.540]   Now Jason, did you must have now come on?
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.940]   You're comfortably off.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.940]   Did you buy the solid state?
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.660]   Oh well, embarrassing enough to say about three of them.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.100]   For the regular one of the solid state.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.260]   So tell us about the solid state.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.260]   Do you have you been?
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.260]   Solid state's not in yet.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:41.380]   I told my assistant to watch the keynote and whatever, you know, they put out to buy me
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.660]   three of them, whatever the three different versions were.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.300]   Because I said, I'll give one to somebody on my staff.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.140]   We're having a contest at the office for one of them.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.140]   We're calling the certified.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.140]   You could have had this job, Robert.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.140]   I could have.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.140]   He might still.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.140]   You never know.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:57.140]   Things might not work out.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.820]   I just like, you know what?
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.900]   For my friends, I just like pumping up their deals with other people.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.940]   I used to do this with Gina from Life Hacker all the time.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.940]   Yeah, it's a bit of fun.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:10.540]   I was trying to hire her for Web Log Sync and I said, Gina, you know, I know that you're
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.500]   really comfortable and you're good friends with Nick.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.420]   Will you at least let me sit down and explain to you the value proposition, right?
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.380]   So she's okay, you know, no harm in that.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.100]   So, you know, see her and say, okay, I'll give you this amount of equity in the brand,
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.580]   this amount of cash, you know, in this kind of budget and, you know, whatever.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.060]   And she's like, wow, that's a much better deal than I have with Nick.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.900]   And I was like, well, let me give this to you in writing here.
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.300]   And you can always sign it, and then you can email to him.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.260]   And every like nine months, six, nine months, I say, how are you doing?
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.260]   I wanted to make you an offer.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.900]   I'd like to increase the offer 10%.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.420]   And I knew she wouldn't take it, but I was like, this is just great.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.700]   I must be making Nick Denton's life miserable.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.300]   So I just kept and I did that with two or three of their different employees.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.300]   You just ruined it, though.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.500]   Next time you do that, could you email me with a deal to an all at another 10% on it?
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   Me too, because I, this guy had twits not paying me.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.500]   Oh, never mind.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.420]   So I actually do want to hire Tina.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.620]   I've seen both of them.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.620]   Right.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.620]   It's really, yeah.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.140]   But anyway, solid state one, I'm going to get next week.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.700]   And I'll definitely let you know that.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.380]   I'm intrigued on that one.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.260]   And I don't know anybody who's willing to spend that kind of three grand on that.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.820]   If you're doing video editing, this is not the machine for you.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.820]   Obviously.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.820]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:24.700]   If you're surfing the web and doing word processing in Excel, it's the same as any other machine.
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.700]   How's the battery life?
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.700]   Because that's the one, one area that I've.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.900]   Because I can't swap out the battery.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.540]   Yeah, I carry two or three batteries.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.540]   I'm flying a.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.540]   Jason solved that.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.180]   He carries two or three air, but a MacBook Air is.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.740]   No, I have a plug.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.740]   The day, you know what?
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.740]   It's funny that you mentioned that.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.740]   It's light enough.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.740]   And see, this is a problem.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:49.980]   This is a machine that the executives are going to love, but the normal people are like,
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.820]   I don't know, or 80 gig drive, non-replaceable battery.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:54.820]   I don't know.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.820]   I think I'll say.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.820]   I don't know, I'm not going to say that.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:01.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:08.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:13.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:16.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:17.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:25.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.820]   I'm not going to say that.

[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.820]   I'm not going to say that.

[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:34.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:35.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:36.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:37.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:38.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:39.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:40.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:41.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:42.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:46.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:52.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:53.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:54.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:55.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:56.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:57.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:58.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:48:59.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:01.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:02.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:03.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:05.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:09.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:11.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:12.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:13.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:15.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:18.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:20.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:21.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:23.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:24.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:26.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:27.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:29.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:30.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:32.820]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.820]   I mean, so $3,500 you could get into an ad buy for the year.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:38.820]   It's about $4,500.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.820]   In traffic, it's up on podcast, right?
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.820]   You know, I don't know if traffic's up.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:44.820]   I'll tell you.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.820]   Let's not be.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:50.060]   I don't want to become the podcast about podcasts, but there's a lot of misinformation about
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.220]   numbers and podcasting.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.820]   I'd say traffic is pretty flat right now.
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.820]   I think in general, what's happening is there's a saturation.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.820]   People, everybody who could figure out how to use iTunes has.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.820]   Now, you're doing something completely different at Fast Company.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.820]   I don't even know if I would call what you're doing podcasts exactly.
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.820]   I make sure blogging and podcasting and blogging.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.820]   I'm sure your numbers are up here because what you're doing.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.820]   I mean, Davos must have driven a lot of traffic.
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.820]   I've not put them out.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.820]   Some of the videos got watched a thousand times.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.820]   Some of them may be 5, 10,000 times.
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.820]   Yeah, but you're doing a lot of videos so that you can't--
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.820]   Yeah, I did 50 videos in a week.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.820]   So we're talking 50 and a quarter of a million views.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.820]   You're talking about a lot of views.
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.820]   What was Fast Company's idea behind-- what were they thinking?
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:35.820]   What were they thinking?
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.820]   What were they hoping?
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:44.820]   They saw a way to get their online space expanded quickly and get a lot more visibility.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.820]   They spent a lot of money on a new social network that's coming out in the next--
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:50.820]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:55.820]   And from your point of view, control was key, right?
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.820]   Well, not really.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.820]   I don't control anything.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:01.820]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:02.820]   You just told us.
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:03.820]   You had an accident.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.820]   The woman, I want control.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.820]   What happened?
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:12.820]   No, what I liked about Fast Company was they have a great brand.
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:16.820]   They have a great team that can get me into things I couldn't get into.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.820]   You know, a dance for instance, I was at a Fast Company party just the other night and it was really, really neat.
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:22.820]   No, I think it's a good brand.
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.820]   A very excellent brand.
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.820]   And for me to do all that work, I'd have to beat myself up.
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:37.820]   I watched O'Malley have a heart attack in December and I just said, you know, hanging out with my new five-month-old is more important than spending every waking moment.
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.820]   That does change your perspective a lot.
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:41.820]   I agree with you.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.820]   And I got an offer that's just unbelievable.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:48.820]   And now I have teenagers, so I'm doing everything I can to get out of the house.
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.820]   You've got to come down to have me in vain.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.820]   Anything I can to get away from my kids I will do.
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.820]   You'll see.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:56.820]   I got a good part.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:57.820]   You got Patrick.
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:58.820]   He's great.
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.820]   Patrick was with...
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:05.820]   So do your sons or daughters, I don't know what they are, but do their friends listen to the podcast?
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:06.820]   You know, it's funny.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:07.820]   Henry...
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.820]   Some do.
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.820]   He has one friend who's a huge fan.
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:11.820]   Henry doesn't understand it at all.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:12.820]   Henry's 13.
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.820]   He says, "Why is this guy listening to your crap?"
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:20.820]   And then he was at Skates camp at Woodward West down in the Southland.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.820]   And one of his counselors was a huge Twitch fan.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.820]   And I think he got some points out of that.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.820]   But mostly my kids are like, they don't even know what I do.
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.820]   They say, "Oh, he's in computers or something."
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:32.820]   They don't know that.
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:33.820]   Internet thing.
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.820]   It's never going anywhere.
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.820]   Hey, you get ready.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.820]   Here's our art bell moment of the week.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.820]   Our conspiracy theory.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:49.820]   So the cable that crosses the Mediterranean carrying the Internet to the Middle East and
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.820]   Asia, there's three of them.
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.820]   Two of them get cut.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:55.820]   Egypt has to kind of shut down all...
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.820]   They say, "Please don't download movies and music.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.820]   We don't have enough bandwidth."
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.820]   There's a 20% cut to bandwidth to India.
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.820]   Iraq is offline.
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.820]   Then the third gets cut the next day.
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.820]   All three cables go down.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:12.820]   You think some sort of conspiracy or just coincidence?
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.820]   It sounds too...
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.820]   Kind of weird, huh?
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:17.820]   Kind of weird.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:18.820]   There are a lot of...
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.820]   It's not a...
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:20.820]   It's dragging a lot of anchors.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:24.820]   Our big allies do buy in Saudi Arabia also offline.
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:25.820]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:29.820]   I think it sounds too strange.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.820]   It's sabotage?
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:31.820]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.820]   Sabotage?
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.820]   What are you thinking, Jason?
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:35.820]   I don't know.
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.820]   What's that thing?
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.820]   Aacom's razor or whatever?
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:40.820]   Acom's razor.
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:41.820]   The most obvious thing.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.820]   Maybe it's the most obvious thing.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:43.820]   Maybe it's just an anchor.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.820]   Maybe it's just an anchor.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.820]   Maybe, you know, sometimes an anchor is just an anchor.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.820]   To paraphrase Sigmund Freud.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.820]   Exactly.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:54.820]   It does show you how fragile the infrastructure for the Internet can be in some of these countries.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:55.820]   I mean, that's a little scary.
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:59.820]   Well, waiting till we have our big 8.0 earthquake in the Bay Area.
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:01.820]   I'm between...
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.820]   Between me and Google is San Andreas fault.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.820]   You know, wait until that thing rips those...
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.820]   Well, that's all right.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:08.820]   You just use Microsoft Yahoo.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:10.820]   Go North.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:12.820]   Go North, young man.
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:15.820]   The cable to Microsoft area, a classic fault.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.820]   Our feel good story of the week.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:25.820]   Across the universe, NASA celebrating the 50th anniversary of its founding, the 40th anniversary
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.820]   of its Deep Space Project, which is big dishes.
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:34.820]   Actually, it's not sending, but receiving signals from some of these Deep Space satellites.
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:41.820]   And the 40th anniversary of the Beatles song across the universe on Monday evening, 7 o'clock
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.820]   Eastern time, they are going to beam across the universe.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:52.820]   They're going to aim at Polaris, the North Star, which is 431 light years away.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:58.820]   So in 431 years, the aliens on Polaris are going to finally figure out we're here and
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:54:59.820]   come and eat us.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.820]   Or no, they're going to just go to BitTorrent and download some Beatles.
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:05.820]   Whoa, these guys are good.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.820]   These guys are pretty good.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:07.820]   These guys are pretty good.
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.820]   Pirates Bay.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.820]   By then, who knows, 431 years from now?
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:12.820]   Pirates Bay may be all over the universe.
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.820]   Pirates Bay guys, that's actually interesting news.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:16.820]   They're getting sued by Sweden.
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:19.820]   Yeah, the whole thing is coming apart or something.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:22.820]   It seems that these guys are going to face jail time for guys.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:26.820]   Finally, the Swedish government, I guess, found a law.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:30.420]   Some sort of law they could prosecute these guys under.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:37.740]   And yet, the Pirates Bay announced just shortly before that 10 million users, 1 million torrents,
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.060]   they say, and this is usually their defense, the Swedish government, the Swedish police,
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.060]   they don't understand.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.060]   We're not sharing files.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.500]   We're just telling people where to find files.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.820]   They're just telling them where the BitTorrents are.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:50.820]   The BitTorrent files are.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:55.740]   They don't have any illegal files on any of their servers.
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.740]   How are they going to prosecute them?
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:58.740]   Or is that disingenuous?
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:55:59.740]   Is it obvious?
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.740]   Tributory infringement.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.860]   I don't know the law over there, but...
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.860]   No, it's contributory infringement.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:05.860]   Yeah, that's...
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:06.860]   I shouldn't do that because we have...
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:07.860]   How did 89,000 corona...
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.900]   We have many Swedish listeners, and every time I do that, they get mad at me.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.140]   1.2 million corona is the fine, 109,000.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.740]   They probably make that in their ads every day.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.180]   So it's a fine, it's not jail time.
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.180]   No, it's easy.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.180]   It's a year in jail, too.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:22.180]   Interesting.
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:24.100]   Should they be found guilty to the head pirates?
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.700]   Punish will include a year in jail.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:27.700]   Ouch.
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:30.980]   I always thought Pirate's Bay was kind of immune.
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:34.580]   They sure act that way with that section where they mock people for sending them cease
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:35.580]   and desist letters.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.580]   It seemed to have been an operation for a long time, so they shut it down and it's going
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:39.580]   to move it somewhere else.
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:40.580]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.580]   Remember they wanted to buy that...
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:43.580]   It wasn't exactly an island.
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:45.820]   It was an old oil rig or something.
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:46.820]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.700]   That was the one that was featured in, wired back in the day as it was going to be like
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.820]   the offshore place to put your stuff.
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:57.940]   I remember talking to a government official in the Bahamas and that was their plan.
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.140]   They said, his...
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:03.740]   He said, "This is where pirates came 200 years ago to store their booty.
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.020]   We want to be the kind of offshore...
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.580]   Like the Cayman Islands are for banking.
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:13.380]   We want to be the offshore home for data nets, free data nets.
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.020]   I don't know if they've done it.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:18.100]   They were putting in a big line to the mainland.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.780]   I think that's also known as China.
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.260]   Yeah, isn't that what China's up to?
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.940]   I mean, I was at the office of the day.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:28.300]   I walked by someone who's computer and they were watching South Park and some of these
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.380]   other shows and it was because it was on a server in China.
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:32.380]   Well, that's...
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:33.380]   Yes.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.100]   If you can go to the Chinese search engines and search for stuff, you'll find all the
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.100]   stuff there.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.700]   I just don't think it's not indexed in Google.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:44.020]   How are you going to stop this stuff when it's global and every country...
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.020]   That's why WIPO exists.
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.140]   They're trying to get our copyright laws in force for a while.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.140]   It's very simple.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:51.380]   You just charge people a fair price and make it more convenient to get it.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.380]   No, that'll never work.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:53.380]   That'll never work.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.380]   Sonos and the...
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:55.380]   Sonos and Rhapsody.
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:58:00.060]   I mean, it's so much easier to just pay your ten bucks and have everything than install
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:04.260]   a bit-touring client and then figure out how to just win rare and unzip stuff.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:05.500]   I mean, people don't want to do that.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.260]   Yeah, and the more you push down on this kind of stuff, the more you're just going to force
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:13.860]   the sneaker net to come back because I have a stack of terabyte hard drive sitting behind
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:14.860]   me.
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:15.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:19.820]   Well, and the iPod, despite everything Apple's ever done, the iPod is still the world's best
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:20.820]   piracy tool.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:21.820]   So, let's fill it up.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:22.820]   Bring it to your friend.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:23.820]   They download one of many programs.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.620]   It'll copy the contents and there you go.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.620]   I said, "I'm bidding in bother with that.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.620]   They just trade iPods."
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:29.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.620]   That's a good idea.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:31.620]   Patrick's a guy.
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.620]   We don't do that.
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.300]   Oh, Patrick's listening.
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.220]   What do the 14-year-olds do these days?
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.420]   What if you're playing WoW right now?
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.420]   Oh, that's what they do.
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.620]   What'll the Warcraft play well into it, man?
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:43.780]   Desi, is that his new thing?
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:44.780]   You better watch out.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:45.780]   You have...
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.780]   How many hours does he allow to play?
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:49.580]   What's that?
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.580]   How many hours does he allow to play?
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:52.580]   Unlimited.
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:53.580]   What?
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:54.580]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:55.580]   You're like Devorek.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:56.580]   Devorek said that.
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:57.580]   He brought up his whole family.
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:58.580]   His kids are grown now.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.580]   I think one's in jail, the other one's a drug addict, but they're grown now.
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.580]   I'm just kidding.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:04.580]   And he said, "You know, I never limited them and let them play whatever.
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:06.580]   They get tired of it after a while."
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:07.580]   Yeah, you know.
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:08.580]   I limit my kids.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:09.580]   Absolutely.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.580]   Oh.
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:11.580]   Do we limit you, Patrick?
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.580]   No.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:15.580]   Fortunately, my kid doesn't even want to do that.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.580]   He likes to skate.
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.580]   That's all he wants to do is go out and ride his skateboard.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.580]   Oh, you're lucky.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:23.580]   I mean, most parents are worried about their kids being like 800 pounds.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:24.580]   I know.
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.580]   No, he's not.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:26.580]   But he's not also.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.580]   He'd rather skate than do homework.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:29.580]   That's the other thing.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.580]   Oh, I mean...
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.580]   Did you do...
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.580]   Now, Jason, tell me.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   When you were in seventh grade, did you do homework?
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.580]   I was like straight sea guy.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:37.580]   Good.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:38.580]   That's what I like to do here.
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:39.580]   I was a total screw up.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.580]   But I knew how to use computers and I was hacking when I was 12 years old.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:42.580]   See?
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.580]   They're taking us all the phone-freaking, doing all kinds of illegal activity.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.580]   Oh, really?
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.580]   You got alone.
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:50.580]   I mean, this jobs and was, they were blue boxers.
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.820]   I mean, actually, you know what I shouldn't say was illegal.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:56.140]   It was unknown if it was illegal because there weren't laws on the books at that point.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.580]   It was just like 82, 83.
[00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:58.580]   It was pretty...
[00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:59.580]   It was great.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.180]   I guess they started busting people in '85, '86 when they started coming down and knocking
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.780]   people's doors down in Brooklyn and Queens and I was in Brooklyn.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.580]   And we used to do phone-freaking all the time.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.580]   Really?
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.860]   Yeah, I'd say it was basically, I mean, as the light is freaking and hacking, you could
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.860]   ever do.
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.620]   You basically, the people traded software via sneaker net where it would dial on your phone
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.860]   like the different codes and put in random codes and then you would get some of the...
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.860]   You know the first two codes and then you would randomly do the next codes.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.620]   You had to write a little bit of codes to try different things and it would listen to
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:27.620]   the tone on the phone.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:32.300]   And so if you called Sprint or whatever, MCI, if it was an 800 number, then you dial like
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.980]   an 8-digit code or 9-digit code.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.220]   If you got it right, you heard a dial tone.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.020]   If you didn't, you heard...
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.460]   So you just set your thing up to identify that.
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.460]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:46.580]   I met Captain Crunch one time and he got his name by blowing in or Captain Crunch one time.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.580]   Crunch whistles to make the tone.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.580]   Yeah, make the tone.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.580]   He's still around.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.580]   I've known him for some time.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:57.260]   He actually was a great influence in Woz and Woz has just agreed to serve on the board
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.260]   or something.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.460]   Some new business that Crunch is doing that's kind of strange.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.260]   Yeah, I heard about that.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:04.460]   Woz and Bob was something strange or kidding.
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.380]   Crunch and Bob went something strange.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:11.900]   I think it's probably for Woz, it's just supporting an old friend.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.780]   But apparently Crunch is coding still.
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:19.740]   The guy has no teeth and of course, I don't know why, maybe ate a lot of Captain Crunch.
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.540]   He also likes to wrestle.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.380]   He's big in a nude wrestling.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.540]   That's all I remember is that we'd go over to his place, hang out and eventually come
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.540]   around and...
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.700]   You want to go in the back room and wrestle?
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.700]   That's what I'd leave.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.940]   It's much more information than we probably did at this point.
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.940]   I don't know.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.940]   No, that was 60s.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.940]   There was a lot of these experiences going on.
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.940]   We did.
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:43.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   I needed the money.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.940]   What can I say?
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:46.940]   I don't know.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.940]   So then Captain Crunch and Woz were like...
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.580]   I don't know if they ever wrestled.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.580]   You want to talk to the fact that wrestle with us and Bill Gates and...
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.220]   I'll tell you, you want to see an explosion, Joe.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.540]   Just light a cigarette and Captain Crunch's presence.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.540]   Oh my God.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.540]   Oh boy.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.580]   There's something going on there.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.020]   Some sort of deep-sated resentment.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.700]   The interesting thing, I remember when I was a kid, somebody figured out with the New
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:12.500]   York City phones or the bell phones that if you took a hanger, like a normal hanger,
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:17.100]   you know, like a wire hanger, and if you bent it a certain way and made a curve and you
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:21.340]   stuck in the coin slot and you shook the phone and just ran it up and down, you could
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.340]   get quarters out.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.740]   Like, quarters would fall out.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.740]   Really?
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.740]   And not a lot.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.260]   It was something to do with, I think, if the phone was like sort of more towards the filled
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.260]   up end, you know, without...
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.260]   There's a little extra slop.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:36.740]   Even there's a little slop on the top and you would just do this.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.500]   So that's what we would do as kids.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.780]   We'd go around to phones and shake them and bang them.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.780]   I mean, I was involved in a lot.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.780]   You were a thug.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.780]   I was involved in that stuff.
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.780]   He still was a thug.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:49.780]   But he taught you.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:50.780]   Come on.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.780]   I am the most upstanding guy ever.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.180]   I'm an upstanding citizen now.
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.180]   I am totally honest.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:56.180]   Do you miss those days?
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.780]   You wish you were kind of a little bit fringy still?
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.380]   You know, no, actually, because I realized something really...
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:06.060]   I was having this conversation with somebody who just involved in law enforcement.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:11.180]   I'm just like, I don't understand people who are criminals because the system of entrepreneurship
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:15.580]   in our country is basically set up to be almost as criminal as possible.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:24.380]   I mean, you can start a company tomorrow, absolutely fail, run up debt, you know, screw
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.860]   up, lay off all your employees, not pay them, whatever.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.260]   And because of the corporate shield laws and everything like that, you get away with
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.260]   it.
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:32.260]   I mean, I don't necessarily agree with it.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.620]   I mean, that's why in Europe, they don't allow you to do this kind of stuff.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.780]   You're responsible for your employees.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:36.780]   You're responsible.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:40.660]   But with the exception of paying the government for tax, you know, if you don't pay your taxes,
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:41.660]   you are screwed and that will...
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.660]   No, the government wants its cut.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.180]   But anything else is up to you.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.300]   How much anything else basically can just...
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:51.700]   And that's why I am always confounded when people are like, should I take a risk and
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.900]   try this to do this company?
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.020]   Because I'm like, yeah, because you can always go back and work a Yahoo.
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.020]   What did you lose?
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.020]   What if you lost?
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.020]   Exactly.
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.020]   Well, what if it doesn't work out?
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.020]   That doesn't work out.
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.700]   Swung the bat, you missed the wall.
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.700]   You don't go to jail?
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.940]   Yeah, it's swing again.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:10.860]   You know, and so the life of crime is so ridiculous that...
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.900]   Well, it's somebody stupid who doesn't get it.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.180]   The amount of work that goes into committing crime is...
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.180]   It's too much work.
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.980]   It's too much work for too little benefit.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.500]   Start a company like just go be an accountant.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.500]   You'll make...
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.500]   Have you learned how to use QuickBooks?
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.500]   You can make 50 bucks an hour.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.460]   If you're trying to rob somebody, you're not going to make 50 bucks an hour?
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:29.460]   You've learned something here.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.180]   I mean, literally QuickBooks guys who...
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.700]   People who know QuickBooks, which you're going to learn in a weekend, are making 40,
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.500]   50 bucks an hour on Craigslist.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.500]   That's a crime.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.980]   That's a crime right there.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.580]   I mean, there's a huge loophole.
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.020]   I can't find people to do QuickBooks, you know?
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:50.820]   I want to start a new page on Mahalo forever.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.260]   Innovative ways to make money.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:58.140]   Tastes like Alikhanis is the founder of Mahalo, among many, many other things.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.540]   M-A-H-A.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.540]   I always get this wrong.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.540]   A-L-O, am I right?
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.540]   Yeah, Mahalo.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:07.580]   And you know what I have to tell you is, every time I do the show, the number of searches
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:12.420]   from Mahalo, we get maybe 700-800 people a day search for Mahalo and come to the site
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:13.860]   because you can watch that.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:17.060]   It doubles or triples whenever the show comes up.
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:21.020]   And I get at least, I don't know, 100 people adding me on Facebook?
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.020]   That's every time.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.020]   It's really amazing.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.540]   Every time I'm on Twitter, my Twitter goes mad.
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:27.540]   Knock on wood.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:33.220]   If you weren't CNBC or something like that or CNN, you don't get the response you get
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.220]   from Twitter.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.220]   I know, I was not amazed.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.220]   I was not a CNBC for an hour.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:37.780]   I didn't get the kind of resource.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.340]   Not one person called you, right?
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.340]   A few people, but not as many as...
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:43.340]   I got two.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.340]   I got two.
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.060]   I got two people like, "All right, so you're on CNBC."
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:53.780]   Twitter, it's like literally dozens of emails, hundreds of social network ads, it's crazy.
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:56.500]   I don't get it myself, but I'm, "Hey, knock on wood.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.900]   Thank you everybody for that."
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.980]   Jason is Jason McCabe-Calicanis on Facebook.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:06.020]   And you're not full yet, although I don't think, "Robert, you have any more room, do you?"
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.620]   No, I can't take more friends.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.620]   I talked to Zuckerberg about that last week.
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.020]   He said they're going to fix it.
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.420]   Oh, don't fix it, because who wants more than 5,000 friends?
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.420]   I do.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.220]   I got to stay ahead of Jason.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:19.940]   I'm at 4,470 friends.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.260]   I've got room.
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.580]   I think I'm going to save 30 slots.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.180]   I have like 300 ads to do.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.180]   I just haven't had the time.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:28.180]   You know what's in the ring of a simp chip?
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.380]   It's about 30 or 40 people a month drop off.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.380]   Oh, okay.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:36.100]   So it's a decay rate, which we could be fascinating to compare.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.100]   Yeah, no, that's good.
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.820]   So those are people who are annoyed with all your old posts.
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.340]   Well, you can't unfriend somebody.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.980]   Robert Scobull and Jason Calcano are in a relationship.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.980]   They're not in a relationship.
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.540]   That's my favorite part.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:51.660]   When you have a lot of friends on Facebook, you see a lot of that.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:54.660]   Every day, if it's raining out, I get like seven breakups.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.660]   Isn't it funny?
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:57.260]   Hey, Elwood's on everybody's in a relationship.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.260]   It's so funny.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.260]   I love that.
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.020]   There's a correlation between the weather and relationship up and down.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.900]   It's like breakups and makeups.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:07.300]   I think it's just that's part of the best part of having a lot of friends on Facebook.
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:12.620]   On Twitter, of course, Jason is Jason Calicanis, C-A-L-A-C-A-N-I-S.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.260]   Robert is Scobullizer.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:17.660]   They're in a race to the top.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:18.660]   I'm in there somewhere.
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:19.660]   I think I'm number 12 on Twitter.
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:23.420]   I'll take still a cop 3 and a half bucks.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:27.100]   I'm still accepting friends on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.900]   I'm trying to catch these two.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:29.900]   I'm a laggard.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:33.060]   If you had never left Twitter, you would have been there.
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.060]   I'm starting.
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.060]   I had to start over.
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.060]   You were the guy.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.900]   The reason I joined Twitter is that I was.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:40.860]   I had to start over just to get back to where I was.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   This is not right.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:42.860]   Talk back.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.340]   You know, you will help you.
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:46.140]   Everybody will do a little rush.
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.500]   We'll get you in the top 10 within a month.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.500]   I guarantee you.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.500]   A month.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.420]   I think closer to sooner than that.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.180]   I'm right out of the top 10 right now.
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.500]   It's going up a couple of hundred a day.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.940]   I think I'll catch up with you.
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:56.940]   I don't know that.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.940]   I don't know that.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.500]   I want to Twitter right now until everybody's a friend to you.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.500]   No, no, no.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:02.740]   We do it too, yeah.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:03.740]   Oh, stop.
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:06.740]   The thing that's weird about Scobull.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:09.540]   I have to look at your page, Jason.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.900]   How many people do you follow?
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:14.100]   I follow almost all of them, but I don't do it on my phone.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.100]   I only follow them on the web.
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.980]   You follow everybody on those friends with you?
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:17.980]   You follow them?
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:20.620]   There used to be a button that said "add everybody."
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:21.620]   They took that way.
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.900]   You have 4,313 friends.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:28.620]   Robert, I don't know how this happens, has more friends than people follow him.
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.620]   Because people drop me.
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.620]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:36.700]   Well, Dave Wider the other day was doing the political stuff, so he was literally using
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:37.860]   Twitter like that.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:38.860]   Oh, no, yes.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.700]   He was live Twittering the debates, right?
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.100]   By the way, there's nothing wrong with the numbers right now, whatever.
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.100]   On Twitter, haalik.
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.700]   Oh, on Twitter, I was just looking at the debt.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.260]   What happened with Twitter and Joyant?
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:50.260]   Does anybody have...
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.020]   Yeah, they moved off of Joyant.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.020]   Was that a divorce?
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.020]   Was that a bitter divorce?
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.020]   I don't think it was bitter.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.940]   I think they just outgrew Joyant's ability to scale.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:03.420]   Evan ounces or business ounces on the Twitter blog.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:06.940]   We're going to start using "Joyant" for Super Bowl coverage because we know it's going
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:07.940]   to be big.
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:13.980]   "Joyant" is a web service company that offers peak bandwidth and times of need.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:18.060]   And then all of a sudden, and then all of a sudden, Twitter is having all sorts of trouble.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.300]   All of a sudden, I'm so sick of that error message.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.260]   And then we see they've split up.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.260]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.580]   I heard a month ago that they were moving off of Joyant.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.580]   Okay.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.100]   So maybe that was planned.
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:35.260]   Hopefully they get these problems under their belt and move on.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.660]   We're getting tired of getting kicked off.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:41.180]   I have to say, I'm glad I'm back on Twitter because it's not about functionality.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.420]   It's not about features.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.260]   It's totally about who's on there.
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.260]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.260]   That's all it matters is the community.
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.260]   That's it.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.660]   It's amazing the friendships you build on Twitter.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:54.060]   And then when you go to a conference, everybody, you meet people that you know on Twitter,
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.060]   it's really amazing.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:58.180]   Well, if I could figure out some way to follow all the people who are following me, I would,
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.020]   but there is no button anymore to do that.
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.020]   There's a script.
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:04.020]   If you write a Twitter team, they'll turn on the script.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.020]   Ooh.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.020]   I don't know.
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.020]   It makes me...
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.020]   I get so much...
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:11.220]   I only follow 134 people, but I get so much, including you too, and I get so much out of
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.060]   the links that you guys put up.
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.980]   It's very valuable.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.980]   The problem...
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.780]   I wish I could follow two groups.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.860]   One really close friend and then one the math group.
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:24.100]   Because the problem is when you follow so many people...
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.540]   You can't find the good stuff in the drawers.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.740]   No, it's just that it's a chat room.
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.940]   And you have to watch it like a chat.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940]   Constantly.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.940]   There's a new post.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.940]   Yeah, it moves way too fast.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:38.180]   There's a new post every two seconds on my Twitter, and I just can't keep up.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.940]   So now I'm using search engines to pull things out.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.300]   To search your own Twitter?
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.300]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.780]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.100]   And there's some really good tools.
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:55.900]   I'll put them on my blog that let you watch live Twitter.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:02.260]   Like I was watching the Mike Stop Yahoo reactions yesterday on one of these Twitter search engines.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.180]   Twitter's an interesting platform.
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.500]   They haven't really done anything to monetize it, I don't think yet.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.260]   And yet there's all this interesting stuff going on.
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:10.260]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:11.260]   It'll be very easy to monetize.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.420]   If you were the CEO of Twitter right now, what would you do, Jason?
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.500]   Well, they have enough money.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.460]   So I would just try to get your own.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.460]   It's an urgency.
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.460]   Yeah, I said this.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:24.340]   They should be trying to build a billion dollar business and try to get to 100 million users
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.340]   globally.
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:26.340]   That's it.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.340]   I mean, if you do that, you'll have a huge business.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.900]   So there's no reason for them to.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:32.180]   I wouldn't even focus on trying to build a revenue model right now because all that's
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:37.540]   going to do is take 30, 40% of your energy and put it towards servicing advertisers and
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.300]   they take over your life.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.060]   Just focus on getting to critical mass.
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.060]   That's what I'm doing.
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.060]   That's my philosophy.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.060]   Just build the audience.
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:49.580]   If you focus on building critical mass, what happens is the advertisers just show up.
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:50.580]   That's my experience.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.580]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.300]   So it's like you could spend all this time trying to convince an advertiser who doesn't
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:58.500]   believe you or you can prove it by showing I have a lot of traffic.
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.820]   How could you not advertise here?
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:01.820]   Make it a must buy.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:02.820]   Guys, you're the greatest.
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:08.260]   It's really good to talk to you, Jason Calicanis, Mahalo, M-A-H-A-L-O.com and Twitter and Facebook
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:11.260]   and many other.
