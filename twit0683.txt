[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   Hi, my name is Ian Thompson, I'm a reporter with the Register and I'm standing in for
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.000]   Leo LaPorte in this Sunday's The Week in Tech Roundup.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.080]   With me in the studio, we had Alex Wilhelm, who is the editor-in-chief of Crunchbase,
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.200]   Lisa Schweitzer from ITPro and Skyping In from Houston, Dwight Silverman, who's been the
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.520]   Houston Chronicles tech guy for the longer than most of us have been in the industry
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.000]   and has some fascinating insights.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.480]   In this week's show, we'll be discussing Google 20 years on the recent shenanigans in
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.360]   the Senate over North Korean hackers, the non-appearance of Google to explain themselves
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.640]   to our nation's elected representatives and the ongoing debate into the Supreme Court
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.640]   justice.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.720]   We're also looking at holes in the International Space Station and whether it's really worth
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:01:05.720]   reconsidering your choice of browser.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.160]   Hello, this is Twitch, episode 683 recorded on the 9th of September 2018, here at the

[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.680]   Hi, this is Ian Thompson, a reporter with a registered standing in for Leo LaPorte,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.600]   who is currently over the other side of the Atlantic and doing weird and wonderful things
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.800]   on the coast of Europe and Africa.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.560]   This will be Twitch and we have a distinguished corny coper of computing talent around me.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.720]   Next up, let's start off with Dwight.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.840]   Dwight, as you well know, this is his 50th show.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   5.0.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.320]   I know, the big 5.0.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.080]   How does it feel?
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.880]   It's a surprise, but it feels just right.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   Excellent.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.640]   Well, Dwight, of course, is editor of Tech Burger for the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.800]   And with me in the studio also is Lisa Smyser, editor of ITPro and a frequent guest on the
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   show as well.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.040]   Not quite as up to Dwight, but we're looking at it.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.840]   No, I'd have to buy a factor of eight.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.640]   And I have a goal now, I have a new goal.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   Yes.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.480]   Well, everyone needs to go in, but it's...
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.600]   And you've just been up in the countryside, I understand.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   I have.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   I spent the weekend on the Russian River.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   It was lovely.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   Fantastic.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   I'm very jealous.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.400]   And last but by no means, Lisa, Alex Wilhelm, editor of Crunchbase and come up from the
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.560]   bay for the show today.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.800]   How's your week being?
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   You had disrupted this week.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   Yeah, it was a busy one.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.600]   It was a short week, but it didn't feel short at all.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.160]   It actually felt quite long.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   So I'm glad we're all back together to kind of go over the stuff that I'm sure I missed.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.920]   It was hectic as heck.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.440]   Ah, so it was the way with conference.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.920]   You sort of...
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   You go around and it's...
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   You know what it's like.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.920]   I mean, you go to a new week.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   I didn't get sick, though.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   Like, I'm not sick.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920]   Really?
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.920]   I'm very...
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   Don't jinx me, it's too early to show for that.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.680]   But like, I actually went for a little bit and left.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.120]   So I think I got away with it, which would be the first to shoot ever that didn't give
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120]   me the plug.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.280]   I'm anticipating going to Microsoft Ignite in two weeks and I'm keeping it down to two
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.520]   days in the hopes that I avoid the sickness that way too.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.520]   I'm flying in Sunday night, flying out to stay night.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.640]   I did six days in Vegas for B-Sides, Black Cat and Def Con and came out with a wicked
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.320]   case of conference cold that lasted sort of two days.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.320]   But in the spirit of being healthy and in the spirit of Elon Musk's latest views on how
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.120]   we should do these sort of things.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.440]   Oh, who's up for a split?
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   Oh, my God.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.840]   No, no, no, I'm kidding.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.040]   This is a family show.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.200]   There is nothing in there other than Pure Legal Tobacco, which will only kill you if
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.880]   you use it as per the manufacturers instructions.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.920]   But what was Elon thinking?
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.080]   I mean, seriously.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.440]   So are we familiar with the Joe Rogan show as a group in general?
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   Yes.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   Have you seen the story?
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   Yes.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.440]   Okay.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.600]   So for people who don't know the Joe Rogan show, it's one dude who is in the MMA scene, Joe
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.960]   Rogan, who's also a quasi-comedian, who doesn't know.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.640]   MMA is mixed martial arts.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.640]   That's basically two people.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.760]   He was basically just the bow hunk that was brought on to be the muscular engineer type.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.360]   And it sort of amazes me that he swerved into this niche.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.680]   I mean, he's mastered it.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.680]   So kudos to him.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.520]   Yeah, but his show has great reach.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.440]   Like James Headfoot from Metallica went on after the latest album.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.640]   Every celebrity of knowns dropped by and it's a long form interview.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.720]   Now what would happen if you took that format and put a kind of really under stress tech
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.320]   executive with a history for drug use and crazy stains?
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.600]   Well, what you can imagine happened.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.640]   So yeah, but I mean, 9% off the share price of the company initially it bounced back slightly.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.680]   The US military is now looking into this because as a federal contractor, he can't actually,
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.800]   he's not supposed to have anything to do with drugs.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.760]   I mean, Dwight, at the end of the day, was this mental breakdown?
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.400]   Was this just publicity seeking?
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.760]   Well, if you watch the whole video, you know, I don't think Elon necessarily was expecting
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:04.880]   it, but haven't there been tweets between his girlfriend and another musician about
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.520]   him getting stoned all the time?
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.600]   I seem to remember a story about that a couple of weeks.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.200]   He was joking about taking it up and he's propped private.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   Yes, right.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   Exactly.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.720]   And so I think he's got, I think he's not, I think he's 420 friendly anyway.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:27.000]   And he's not the guy actually working, turning wrenches on the rocket.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.960]   So I'm not sure exactly how that extends up.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.120]   One of the things that's really fascinated me about the legalization of pot around the
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.520]   country is you have places where it's now legal, but you have businesses who will fire
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.320]   you if you do it.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:49.680]   And this kind of dovetails into that a little bit because what are Teslas and space and
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.080]   exes rules about doing marijuana?
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.520]   Are you even on your own time?
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.520]   It's certainly in public.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.080]   Yeah, there was a report of a woman who was fired from Tesla because she tested positive
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.680]   for marijuana cannabis and she was mad because Elon was out there smoking weed.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.080]   Now, I don't have a problem with what you do in your own time for sure, but I do think
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.640]   that it was a failure of crisis communications to in the middle of the struggles that Tesla
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.840]   has had in the last 12, 18, 24 months, do go through this level of distraction and stupidity
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   into the mix.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.040]   Well, I guess the question is the question I have is how does Musk understand his relationship
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.880]   with his shareholders and his board of directors because it's one thing when it's your company
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.600]   and there are not people who have put their money into it and are relying on you to make
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   the kind of decisions that will increase market valuation.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.240]   But when you become a public company, you are essentially making a contract with shareholders
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.280]   that says, when I act as a representative of this company in the public space, everything
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.880]   I do, I do in the interest of increasing value.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.880]   And I don't know.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.520]   It's totally value doesn't it?
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.520]   He hasn't demonstrated.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.480]   Well, he hasn't demonstrated an awareness of that.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.160]   He hasn't demonstrated an understanding that once your company is publicly treated, your
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.320]   relationship to both your intellectual property and your corporation is much different than
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.120]   when you own the whole thing the whole way down.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.000]   Well, also, he spends so much time complaining about short short sellers going after his
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   stock and then to give them such blatant ammunition seemed quite frankly a little bit
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.600]   bizarre, but self-defeating even.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.080]   But this is the story of Elon in the last couple of years.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.360]   I mean, he's done with through his firms a lot of really great stuff.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.080]   I still watch SpaceX launches come a huge nerd.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.080]   None of me too.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   He's revolutionized.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   Love the live videos.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.080]   Fantastic.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.040]   And the model three launch has finally revved up their claim to hit possibly this year.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.320]   If he just said nothing, a lot of stuff would have gone away.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:46.400]   Instead, Joe Rogan, a large blunt and a thousand million memes that were born from that moment.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.120]   I mean, just unnecessary and he's better friends to tell him not to do this stuff.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.080]   Well, I also wonder if there's the fallacy of intelligence where the idea is if you're
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.480]   really smart in one area, you're smart in all areas.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.200]   The Germans do have a word for this.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.600]   It means someone who has highly skilled in one area or complete fool in others.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.840]   I'm not going to Google what that is.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.280]   Yeah, I don't think it's definitely in that.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.560]   Because I wouldn't contest his innovation or his genius in a lot of ways.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.680]   And in that interview, one of the things I really liked was how he nerd it out over
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.160]   alternative energy sources.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.840]   I mean, good for him for getting those ideas out to an audience that is not typically hearing
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.760]   those ideas like good for him for that and good for him for being smart about this stuff.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.840]   But is he smart about how to be a CEO of a public facing publicly traded company?
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.120]   Do I have that same interview?
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.040]   He also reiterated the idea that maybe we're all just living in a simulation.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.560]   That came up again.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.320]   And that was after the toe couple of years.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.600]   There's a philosophical term for that too, where, and I forget what that is.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.920]   I read about it recently where there somebody like did an entire philosophical syllogism
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.120]   who's like, this is the only logical conclusion.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   I was like, really?
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.640]   Yeah, that's what Elon believes.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.440]   And that can't be good for a shareholder's either.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.680]   He wants shareholder hope.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.680]   So I mean, that's clear.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.880]   He said you want to get rid of him and he just had like a bunch of Mr. Smiths come in and
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   sit down.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:09.080]   A bunch of Hugo weaving lookalike sitting in the audience all just completely unmused
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.440]   and simulation this Elon.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.760]   Hey, I know that.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.080]   The relation comes for you in this case, I guess.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.800]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.440]   But he just needs to have to be reigned in.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.840]   I'm sorry, like flat out.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   I know he's rich.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.080]   I know he's interesting, but you got to be a better manager in that.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.240]   And you're screwing up your employees.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.840]   That was not just yours.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   It's not just about you.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.400]   In the center of that politics feels all Trump right now.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   All car feels Elon.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.760]   But there's thousands of people that work there that have 401ks and have, you know, I'm
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.760]   sure are.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.760]   Who are invested in this and they don't lie?
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   The terms and the things that are college.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.200]   This is the conundrum of being a CEO is if you're doing it right, a lot of your time
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.360]   is actually spent looking at really big picture stuff and understanding the effects
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.680]   that you have on dozens of people, dozens of constituencies, each with their own priorities.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.360]   And as a public facing CEO, he doesn't demonstrate an understanding or knowledge of that.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.360]   He has the EQ of a six year old.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.040]   Speaking of which, did you see Trump's tweet about Apple over the over the weekend?
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.480]   No, I actually try and staff social media on the weekends now.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   I do.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   That's for the sake of sanity.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.480]   That's actually a mark of maturity.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   Right.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   I feel like this way I don't go into Monday.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   Oh, God.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.480]   I know.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.560]   I took a couple of days off Twitter.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.560]   Yes.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.280]   He's saying basically Apple prices may increase because of the massive tariffs we will be
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.880]   exposing on China.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.680]   But there's an easy solution with a B zero tax and indeed a tax incentive.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.480]   Make your products in the United States instead of China.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.240]   Start building new plants now.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.160]   Exciting exclamation mark, MAGA.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160]   So does he realize?
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.840]   Well, of course, what am I asking that part?
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.400]   So does anyone here realize how long it takes to build any sort of fab plant, bring it online
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   and hire for it?
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.760]   Oh, well, no, it can be done on the twinkly when I am sure.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.280]   So what are the economics of hiring American workers as opposed to Chinese workers?
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   What are the shipping costs?
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.120]   What are the shipping relationships set up with frontline suppliers?
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.600]   Well, the frontline suppliers are also all in China.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.040]   So if you want to do a last minute, and if you take a look like one of the stories that
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.080]   actually that I am, I can't believe I'm going to have to say it this way.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.680]   I began covering this back in late 2005, 2006 was China.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:19.440]   No, China investing a great deal of infrastructure in mobile and mining in Africa.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.000]   And it's paid off for them with smartphones tremendously because they've got locks on
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.360]   the supply chains.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.000]   Chinese investment into Africa has been a 25 year story now.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.240]   It's been fantastic in terms of the scale.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.760]   So exactly how is Apple supposed to somehow like replicate all of that in a few weeks
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.240]   to prevent the price of?
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.240]   Oh, it's completely impossible.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.640]   I mean, the tweets, I'm going to try to be politically neutral this year because I know
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.920]   it's a show with broad region.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.040]   We're not just talking amongst us for, but like there's a lot that's wrong in that tweet
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.120]   and a lot that's kind of silly and just cut off from the economic reality.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.280]   I knew it was going to come up.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.000]   So I pulled the famous tariff quote that everyone really loves to bring up.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.360]   That's why I think tariffs are done.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.560]   So here's kind of the conical.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   This is stupid.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.480]   It goes tariffs not only impose immense economic costs, but also fail to achieve their primary
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.000]   policy aims and foster political dysfunction along the way.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.600]   And here we are kind of living through that moment and everyone called this and we're
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   here anyways.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.320]   It's just it's fantastically frustrating that this has kind of settled economic theory.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.200]   And instead, when I need to buy a new iPhone in a couple of months, I'm probably going
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.640]   to pay more for it and I'm cross.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.800]   I'd like to see more manufacturing in the US.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   I would I would.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.440]   That's what it would be old.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.880]   Yeah, but I would I would like to see that I'd like I'd actually like to see people who
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.280]   work in manufacturing making a living wage in whatever country they're working in.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.320]   I'd like to see humane conditions and I'd like to see a diverse economic base in America.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   I think it's good for us, but I don't think that ignoring what is in favor of trying
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:50.360]   to deflect the blame for a policy that you've put into place yourself, which benefits
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.600]   no American.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   No, no, no, no, no, I can understand.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.600]   I mean, do I.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.160]   Texas used to be a real hub when it came to manufacturing, particularly Houston.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.120]   So do you see this coming back?
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.760]   It seems somewhat difficult.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.720]   Well, Apple has already said it's going to open some factories.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   I think of the US.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.200]   There was in there like a Wisconsin factory that's coming online, but but it can't be
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.560]   done immediately.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:23.200]   And it just shows a complete lack of understanding for how manufacturing works by the president.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.520]   And I think that, you know, Houston is a good example.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.920]   It used to be, for example, compact when it was based here, built everything that they
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.840]   did here in Houston.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:39.040]   And slowly they farmed it out overseas and by the time HP bought them and then when
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.080]   HP took it over, it was pretty much all overseas.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.360]   So this is not this and this happened over a period of years and years.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.960]   It's not something that could come back instantly.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.000]   And it's not something that certainly is going to keep Alex's iPhone cheaper next week.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   So that time is for me and my checking account, but also Niele Patel from the Verge, whom
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.160]   for we all know, was tweeting about this a little bit.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.560]   And he said, you know, reminder that Steve Jobs told Obama that there weren't enough
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.680]   trained engineers in the US to build the iPhone here and recommended opening up immigration
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.680]   to allow for it.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.480]   And I can pull some sights on that if we need them.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.800]   But I mean, we're also, we don't have the talent geared up for this.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.920]   We don't have the infrastructure in place for it.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.880]   The global supply chains wouldn't sync up that way and a bunch of other reasons.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.880]   But of course, you know, POTUS.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.880]   45.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.040]   Again, when you are CEO, you really have to be able to look at a huge picture and understand
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.320]   all of the different working parts and all the constituencies in place and...
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.680]   Or when you're a competent business person.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.760]   I think yeah, I think one of the things that we're seeing actually with the tariff policy,
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.160]   because we're all becoming tariff experts, obviously, talking about this.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.320]   Welcome to Economic Twit.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.320]   This week in tariff.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.520]   No, I think what we're seeing now is a lot of us are finally beginning to understand that
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.840]   it's not commerce isn't a straight channel from, oh, someone made the widget, now I can
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.040]   buy the widget.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:57.280]   There are so many different companies and steps along the way and we are now beginning to
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.120]   understand how it affects us as tech reporters and tech consumers.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.280]   I mean, I'm also in the market for an iPhone.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   And we can split one.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.280]   And we can split one.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.280]   I'm super excited.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.160]   Well, you may be able to check out the new ones on September.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.640]   The 12th, the invites have gone out.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.640]   Of course, the register is blacklisted as ever.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.640]   Are you going, Alex?
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.280]   No, Apple is emailing back one time in my entire career of writing.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.280]   Right.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.280]   Yeah, okay.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.280]   I cover B2B for a living.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.280]   So I'm never on the list.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   I don't know.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.640]   But I watch it just to see if, honestly, I feel like with Apple, it's one of those brands
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.160]   where you can see how it's going to affect the enterprise in 18 to 24 months as people
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.640]   bring the technology into their company and start making it box standard.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.040]   So I watch it for that reason.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.040]   Yeah, we'll see.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.840]   I mean, I was speaking to a journalist who is going and apparently the list of things
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.720]   that you can and cannot do during the presentation is really quite strict.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.360]   You're only allowed to take photos from a certain angle, from a certain position.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.840]   It all looks very sort of tightly controlled, but we're expecting anything really revolutionary
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   from this.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.560]   I hope they have stand breaks every 15 minutes.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.760]   So everybody with the Apple watch can stand up.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.560]   Oh my God.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.120]   That would be staying very on brand, I feel.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.680]   Tim Cook comes out.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.480]   All right, everybody, let's do a stretch.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.120]   I want you to reach into your core.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.040]   Well, apparently it's quite bizarre at Apple headquarters because at 10 minutes to the hour,
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.000]   about half the staff will stand up and start wandering around because they're watching
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   to just tell them to.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Oh, yeah, no, it's all right.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.200]   So this one almost almost everything about it that I mean, as far as we know, has been
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   leaked.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.440]   You know, we even had the nine to five Mac images that were leaked last week.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.600]   And so we kind of know a lot about this already.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.440]   There probably will be some surprises.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.120]   One of the interesting things I think that's coming out of this, you know, if we do have
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.920]   these three iPhones, these three different size iPhone 10 designs, this will be the first
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.440]   time since the iPhone was released that you will not be able to buy a new iPhone with
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.640]   a home button.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.920]   The home button essentially is dead on new iPhones.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.240]   You'll probably be able to buy a seven or eight or some of the older iPhones, but this
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.240]   is basically it.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.360]   It's the death of the home button.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.040]   And for people who like them and still want them, you know, they're going to have to go
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.560]   backwards as opposed to forwards.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.560]   Or just get off the platform altogether and go to and forget off the platform altogether.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.280]   Yeah, I feel like this is the headphone jack.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.560]   Talk all over again.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.880]   I need to apologize actually about that.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.360]   I think I was on Twitch when the whole jokes about courage were made like it's courage.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.920]   Not how the I say that's what we did.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.920]   We all laughed and I was very rude.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.080]   And I probably wasn't good about it because I tend to get a couple of tweets from Twitter
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.920]   fans who are like, you're an idiot, but it's okay.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.920]   I mean, I can't.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.920]   We'll get those.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.760]   Yeah, I did buy AirPods a while ago now.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.760]   And I love them so much.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   I bought some of my fiance.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   I love AirPods.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   They're amazing.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.760]   I do not miss my headphone jack whatsoever.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.080]   I never use a dongle.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   Apple was right.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   It was wrong.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.680]   And I will buy another set the moment they launch version two of them.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   Just get out.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.080]   I know I 3.5 mil Jack is there's no reason whatsoever to get rid of it.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.640]   It's perfectly perfectly from an engineering standpoint.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.800]   It does the job.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.320]   It doesn't take up that much space.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.400]   I could rant about this for absolutely.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.160]   Coke, Pepsi, Coke, Pepsi.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.240]   Okay, how do other two panelists feel about this?
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:11.600]   I have been using Bluetooth for a long time before they dropped that out.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.640]   I very seldom used wired headphones anymore.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.360]   And so it didn't bother me.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.160]   But I think Apple has a history of making the right move and dropping technology.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   And I think that was it.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.480]   And you kind of seen it in a bunch of other phones that have now been released without
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.480]   headphone jacks.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.400]   I think it's and the other thing it's interesting is that wireless headphones, Bluetooth headphones
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.000]   have gotten better since this happened.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.240]   The market has responded by making the sound better and making the quality of the product
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   better.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.720]   And so it actually has held that as well.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.120]   I think it was a brilliant move.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   Sorry, Ian.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.520]   Please tell me I'm not alone in this.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.440]   I'm honestly just here for any headset that makes it like Janet Jackson for Rhythm Nation.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.640]   That is the apex of cool headset technology as far as I'm concerned.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.960]   And if it's not here, let's let me do it.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.400]   But this week aside from new iPhones, I think we're all hoping for a new Mac mini.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.800]   And then the go to complaint from us kind of as a group of people forever.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   So I'm really pulling for that.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.120]   Also, there's dark mode in OS 10, I think's coming up and I was on 12 or something.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.040]   I'd like to see some news on where they're going on the laptops because that's just
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.520]   been such a disappointment over the last couple of years and it's driving users away on an
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.520]   active basis.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.280]   But I don't think we are going to hear.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.280]   Sorry.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.280]   It's good for Microsoft.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   I mean, finally, yeah, we've got a set.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.280]   It's good for them.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   It's kind of cool and Apple laptops aren't good.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.520]   Like 20 teams a weird year.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.520]   I know.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.520]   We've got a surface event.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   The Lenovo Yoga.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.240]   If you take a look, one of the one of the things I love about it.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.400]   At least the two in one.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.600]   Yeah, the keyboard snaps on or snaps off as you need it to.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.640]   It's just very it's it's very elegant.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:50.360]   I've had a chance to get hands on with them and they're they feel so nice.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:56.080]   And I think one of the things Apple has done right is it's kind of predicted a post PC
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.640]   consumer tech environment.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.720]   And that's why they've done a really great job with say their phones.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.400]   They're making the incursion to smart home the iPad and especially the general site
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   pad.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.600]   They're doing a great job there.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.120]   They do seem to take their eye off the ball when it comes to the laptops.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.760]   I think they might be leaving money on the table, but.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.760]   And Microsoft has come.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.120]   I mean, we've got a surface event coming up in first weekend, first, second week in
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.120]   October.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.920]   And October 2nd is the surface.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.920]   Right.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.320]   I mean, I've been using a surface for years.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.600]   It's not a great travel laptop because if you're a short house like me, then you can't
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.520]   balance that kickstand on your knees on the train.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.360]   But at the same time, if you're looking for high volume, sort of high end expensive kit,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.240]   like the air, you know, surface is good.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.520]   I mean, I get the feeling that when Apple runs the numbers, they think there is they
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:48.120]   probably make money more easily with the mobile ecosystem they've set up and with the
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.800]   services that they're doubling down on now.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:56.000]   And so compute, perhaps laptops and other computers are things that will continue to
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.640]   make money for them, but they'll be more of a legacy business.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.560]   To draw parallel, perhaps it's the same way where if you look at Microsoft's business
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.000]   strategy, their Windows division still makes the bulk of their money.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.280]   But year over year, the growth in that division has gone down fairly steadily as the growth
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.720]   in their other divisions has gone up.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.240]   And it's pretty evident that they're like, we're writing this business out.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.480]   We're putting our resources and building our customer opportunities in other areas.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.240]   So maybe that's what Apple's doing.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.200]   I mean, we all obviously love the Apple computers.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.760]   I would happily buy them.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.160]   Is that a Chromebook pixel you're using?
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.320]   This is the original incredible pixel.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.400]   You could fry bacon on this baby when they've been using it for more than three hours.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.120]   You've got to send your fingers after 15 words.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:44.480]   But I don't think Apple's going to be a laptop company for much longer.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.360]   And I will be curious to see how long-time Apple customers feel about that compared to
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.680]   people who came online and came of age in a much different competing environment.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.760]   Can I be wrong about one more thing about Apple before we move on to the Apple Watch?
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.760]   Well, it means.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   I broke this is a 2013 MacBook Pro that I have from work.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.080]   And I broke the keyboard because I type too hard and I just broke it.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.080]   It's also an Apple keyboard.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.600]   Let's face it, the quality is not great.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.600]   Right.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.920]   But this is the non-new version that breaks the whole time.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.400]   Anyways, this was sent into Apple to be fixed.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.760]   And I was given a brand new 15-inch MacBook Pro with the touch bar and the new keyboard.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.760]   Everyone hates it.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.160]   I love the touch bar.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.160]   I thought it was fantastic.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.160]   I was the only person in the history of the world to like it.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   But I thought it was just great.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.160]   Hey, are you unicorn?
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   It's a...
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.480]   Oh, finally, time has come and I'm the Apple fanboy in the room.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.480]   It's the first time ever.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.480]   But I really liked it.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.480]   It feels dizzy.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.720]   It feels like I've crossed my integrity.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.720]   So...
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.960]   The touch bar is great if you want to use photo editing and video editing.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.520]   Things be able to move your finger across the screen.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:51.760]   You know, when you're doing sizing and doing color, it's great.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.120]   My wife has one and she likes it.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.760]   And when I can get it out of her fingers, I use it.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.560]   And that the touch bar for certain things is really nice.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.600]   If you don't ever do any of that, then for a lot of times it's kind of pointless.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.120]   But for those kinds of users, it's actually good in a professional way.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.840]   So you know what I've noticed when I move between my iPad and my laptop computers is
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.600]   I will find myself swiping across my screen.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.600]   Yes.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.240]   Because I'm just so used to that.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:23.120]   Because I have a keyboard for my iPad and I'll switch between the two back and forth depending
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   on what I'm doing.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.800]   And on my iPad, I can of course switch between touching on the screen to typing.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.840]   And the muscle memory carries over.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.880]   And I'm just wondering, and this might be how...
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.040]   Maybe this is how Apple Gloid off of the laptop category at some point is they figured
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.880]   a way to incorporate...
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880]   Touch.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.880]   Touch.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.360]   You know, maybe there's a glove coming that we don't know about or something like that.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.000]   Because people at this point have gotten to where swiping and gesturing is as much a part
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.960]   of a user interface as a mouse.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.400]   It is remarkable when you go back after being with a touch laptop for so long going to another
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.200]   one and going, "Oh, oh for goodness sake, oh right."
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.120]   It feels like you're using an acronym.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.040]   And my oldest nephews are like 11 and eight now.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.880]   And they've grown up only kind of in the smartphone era effectively.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.520]   And they, when they were younger, would try to like touch my laptop screen and they were
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.520]   like five and two.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.960]   Because that's how you touch a computer.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   It's broken on call Alex.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.600]   Well, no, it just doesn't do that.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   There's a question though, does Apple create a hybrid OS X iOS operating system or do they
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.120]   stay distinct because of the state is distinct?
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.200]   I don't see touch ever going to the laptop.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.760]   I think they're going to eventually have one...
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.160]   I think they're going to have to.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.160]   Windows 8 from Apple.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160]   Great.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.160]   Everyone's going to love that.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.200]   Well, I mean, it'll go the same way that Chrome OS went in that you can...
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.520]   With the last couple of iterations of Chrome OS, you can narrow on Android apps in it the
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   first time.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.240]   You can run Android apps very badly in it because no one would resize their apps for
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   the screen.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.920]   But I think that's the way they've got to go.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.920]   The other Windows Universal Window platform now, which is what they're trying to do, is
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:53.000]   encourage the idea to develop once to play across a mobile device or a desktop.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.040]   They've been on that since the Terry Myers scenario, the Windows team.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   Yeah, they'll say.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.040]   Okay, right.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.840]   We're just going to break for a quick word from our sponsors that make this podcast available
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.360]   but we'll be back shortly with the other big news of the week, which is the Senate hearings
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.200]   into technology companies.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   But here's Leo.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   Hi, Ian.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   Hi, gang.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.440]   If you don't mind, I've come back.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:19.320]   I'm a ghost back from vacation just for a moment to tell you about the new Ring Security System.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.320]   I just got mine.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.000]   Ring's alarm security kit.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.680]   By the way, I know people know I'm out of the house, right?
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680]   I'm on vacation.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.240]   You might want to think twice about popping in.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:37.320]   I've got the Ring alarm security kit in place along with my Ring doorbell and my Ring
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.440]   spotlight cams.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.800]   If you do visit the little port of boat during my vacation, you will be smile.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.240]   You'll be on camera.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.960]   And oh, the police will be right there just to escort you out.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960]   You've heard of Ring.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.200]   We talked about the Ring video doorbell for ages.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.840]   They're the ones who reinvented the doorbell to let you answer it with your phone and I
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.840]   love it.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   I use it.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.040]   They've also now reinvented the home alarm system.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.320]   So you probably know this.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:17.200]   The old school alarm companies make their money on the big, high monthly cost for monitoring.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.440]   And they know that you know they make their money because they tie you into like two and
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.960]   three year contracts and they charge through the nose by the month.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.380]   So Ring, just like they've disrupted the doorbell industry and the spotlight industry, they
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.600]   are disrupting the security industry with the Ring alarm.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   This is one kit.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.040]   This is the basic kit, but you can get all sorts of sensors for all kinds of situations.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.600]   They're easy to install.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.820]   You build the system that's just right for you with the sensors on the doors and the windows,
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:55.460]   the motion sensors, the keypad, the siren.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:00.920]   And of course, the 24 hour monitoring and no long term contracts.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:07.740]   You can build the system just right for you and have 24/7 professional monitoring.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.260]   Get ready for this.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.740]   They only charge $10 a month for the monitoring.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.740]   $10.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.740]   Now, you got a base station, you got a keypad, you got a contact sensor, you got a motion
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.440]   detector, you got a range extended, there's all sorts of those.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.380]   You pick the ones you want, you put them in, you install them.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.360]   $10 a month, no long term contracts.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.780]   This is the best, the smartest way to protect your entire home.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:33.060]   The Ring Alarm Security Kit, get it at ring.com and retail stores throughout the country.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.660]   R-I-N-G, ring.com/twit.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:41.940]   Learn how you can get a whole home security, protect your entire home from like $10 a month.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:47.300]   Ring.com/twit, they've done it again.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.100]   Thank you, Ring, for your support of this week in tech.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.660]   Hi, and welcome back.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.420]   Okay, now, of course, the week starts off fairly slowly with Labor Day weekend and everyone
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.380]   taking the Monday off, particularly in the halls of government, but then we were back
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:06.340]   with a bang where you had Jack Dorsey from Twitter, Sarah Sandberg leaning in to Congress
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.380]   for her talks and Google not showing up at all.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.260]   So the Chocolate Factory didn't come along.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.620]   Why do you think that was?
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.860]   They wanted to have the political stunt played on them.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.020]   They sent out a chair for them, gave them a little name tag and then no one sat down.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.140]   It was a bit of a kind of political theater, but it was effective.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:26.380]   I mean, everyone took a picture of the empty Google chair and political shame done soon
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.740]   and I guess everyone else from Google.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.740]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.740]   All right.
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:31.740]   Google has a really dusty.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.740]   Go ahead.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.740]   Go through it.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:39.060]   I was going to say, I think Google gave it what it deserved.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.300]   It was political theater.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:49.060]   It was conservatives kind of whining about not being treated fairly by a business.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:54.100]   It was essentially, it was shaming is what it was.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.260]   It was a joke and I think that Google probably played it exactly as it should have been.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.220]   I like the testy Google statement where they were like, over the last 18 months, we've
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.580]   met with dozens of committee members and briefed major congressional committees numerous times
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.100]   on our work to prevent foreign interference in US elections.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.980]   And the reason I like how they start off with the timeline is they imply that they were
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.740]   on this before Congress was concerned about it.
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.980]   And then they go on to continue that their chief legal officer is going to be in Washington,
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.940]   DC on September 5th.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.100]   So they're welcome to meet with him then.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.620]   But do you think this was in any way related to it?
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.660]   And they also say we informed the Senate committee that this was happening in July and we had
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.860]   understood this was okay with us.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:41.460]   So again, they're written response basically lobs several balls back over the net to Congress.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.660]   All right, your move.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.860]   This isn't plus one minus one though.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.740]   I think they should have shown up and done well.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.980]   I think when you look at the reviews, I mean, is it stupid?
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.980]   Yes.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.980]   Is it useful?
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:51.980]   No.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.860]   Because Tech has had a history of not being as regulated as it could be.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.860]   We're seeing a lot of discussion about regulation right now.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.500]   And I think it was a tactical error, especially when you look at the different reactions that
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:06.460]   Dorsey got compared to the Facebook executive because he was less scripted than she was.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.180]   And that was better received.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.980]   And I think that you showing up there and putting a human face to the company, which
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.500]   is why they didn't send Zuck, of course, because he's a bot.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.980]   So he's trying to send a huge--
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.980]   Still only a rumor.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.340]   It's unconfirmed per the register.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.660]   I think you could have done yourself some favors there.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.620]   And instead, they opened themselves up to an obvious political attack.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.100]   No one read that statement except us.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.780]   Everyone just saw the empty pictures of the empty desk.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.300]   And I don't think they even got a moral victory here.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.660]   I agreed they're right, but this is politics and that doesn't matter.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.660]   But I'm--
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.180]   What I do think is interesting about this is this is the hearing that finally got Alex
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.780]   Jones kicked off Twitter.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.780]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.780]   You know?
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.260]   Yeah, that's a tricky one.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:50.420]   I mean, part of me thinks you should be-- you should allow him to say equal platforms for
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.940]   all the rest of it.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.820]   On the other hand, when you look at the families of the Sandy Hook victims who've been hounded
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.700]   out of their homes, it's-- it's-- ethically, it's a really tricky issue.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.700]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.700]   So I'm not sure what we go on.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.060]   I feel like it was lose, lose for Twitter in that way.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.820]   Because they did ban Jones, which had been a flashpoint and had actually provided a rally,
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.660]   a rallying point for people who have basically become professional boycotters.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:21.900]   And by the way, I think the boycott is a very effective tool for raising awareness.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.900]   I'm never clearing out what's in the bottom line.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.140]   Working hard to say Nike, everybody hit it out the box this week.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.180]   Oh my god, we can hear that in a minute.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:34.900]   But at the same time, what-- it's notable that Alex Jones only got banned after he went
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.780]   after the CEO of Twitter.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:41.340]   And as you pointed out, the bereaved parents of children have been harassed.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.940]   He was allowed to arrest the bereaved parents of children without consequence for years.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.820]   And so I feel like that's kind of a bad look for Twitter because as well, all users are
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.140]   equal, but some users are more equal than others.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:56.740]   And since they've been fighting that kind of imagery all year long, this just sort of
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.740]   extends the street.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.780]   I mean, Dwight, how did this play down in Texas as a true red state, although I gather
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.500]   tech cruises in a bit of trouble at the moment?
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.500]   Yes.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.660]   Well, you know, Alex Jones is from Austin.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:15.900]   But he is-- until he kind of surfaced in a higher profile in the last few years, he was
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.300]   considered basically something of a joke.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:24.340]   You may remember a series of military exercises down here that was codenamed Jade Helm.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.340]   Oh, yes.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.780]   He was panicking about that.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:31.060]   Yes, yes, which Alex Jones was at the root of.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:36.220]   They were-- he was saying that they were going to round people up and put them in abandoned
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:42.220]   Walmart buildings and that that was kind of what the real thing about this was.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.980]   And people had always laughed at Alex Jones, but in this case, the governor of Texas said,
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:52.220]   "Well, maybe we should investigate what Jade Helm is doing and elevated it to a higher
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.220]   level."
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.020]   And then that, along with the Sandy Hook thing, kind of kicked him into a national figurehead,
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.500]   which he should never have been because he's a crank.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.420]   Well, the Jade Helm stuff happened during the Obama administration, right?
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.420]   That was the fear, Mommy.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.220]   The fringe right, if you will, that it was somehow a different takeover.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.420]   Remember when they used to be the fringe right?
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.020]   Yeah, and then they became the alt-right and became the right.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.020]   I didn't actually mean that.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.020]   That was slightly unfair.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.420]   Paul Ryan can still be your daddy.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.420]   It's okay.
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.420]   Now, let's just do it.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.420]   That's my Apple Watch doing this.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:27.740]   On the Alex Jones thing, though, I've struggled with this a bit because I'm a big fan of free
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.820]   speech.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.220]   I think anyone who's-- I was a philosophy major in college.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.100]   I spent a lot of time reading about this.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.100]   And then I discovered that Twitter is a private company.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.100]   It's their own platform.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.900]   And if you're a jerk, they can tell you to leave.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.900]   Any restaurant, any Uber can just be like, "You're a jerk.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.900]   Go away."
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.900]   And in this case, you know what?
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.060]   Maybe the rules should be, if we don't like you, a whole bunch, you're gone.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.900]   And then that's a great policy because you can never run foul of it, if you're told.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.500]   Look, if you want to express yourself, that's great, but understand they're going to be
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.500]   consequences for it.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.500]   This is it.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.500]   This is not consequence for you.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.500]   I know.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.300]   It's something that I found as a foreigner being over here.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.100]   You always hear, "Oh, that's my first amendment, right?"
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.100]   No, that's only the-- That's only the government.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.100]   That's only for the government.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.100]   The government saying that you can't say that.
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.180]   You can still say it, but it doesn't mean we're going to take you seriously and be thinking
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.180]   you're not a wanker.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.180]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.180]   So it's-- And Twitter doesn't shadow ban Jack.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.840]   Also, you have the right to have an opinion.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.380]   Other people have the right to think your opinion is ridiculous.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.860]   And this is something that seems to get lost in the shuffle, too, is having the right
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.620]   to have an opinion does not mean you have the right to have your opinion received uncritically.
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:28.620]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.500]   And deplatforming off Twitter has been incredibly effective.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.540]   I hate to say the following name out loud because I'm pretty sure it's going to give
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.540]   me trouble somewhere.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.540]   We're summoned in the studio.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.980]   Well, yeah, but Milo, you're an op-less.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.580]   An exporter from the UK, actually.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.580]   I sincerely apologize.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:43.580]   Don't worry.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.380]   Complete waste of flesh and organs and an oxygen thief to boot.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.380]   I did once smoke a cigarette with him.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.020]   He smokes mint falls if I call correctly.
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.020]   Oh, goodness.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.020]   What is he?
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.020]   12?
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.020]   That was a while ago.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.020]   That was an unnecessary aside.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:59.860]   When he was deplatformed from Twitter, essentially, his profile fell apart.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.620]   He was just completely gone away.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:06.180]   So I wonder if Twitter does kind of occupied this critical part in our media landscape,
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.620]   because everyone who's in media is on Twitter, that if you deplatforming from off of Twitter
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.260]   itself, it's more effective than taking them off Facebook, for example, or some other social
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.260]   network.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.300]   It's probably maybe a bit more than others.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.740]   Especially on some hackers at Defcon, and they were from the socialist hacking group,
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.420]   and they were saying that some of their members have been kicked off in the same way.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.980]   And it was terrible.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.540]   We can't possibly allow this.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:32.300]   I checked out the archives of their Twitter feed, and it's kind of like, "Yeah, I'd probably
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.060]   kick you off for that as well."
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.060]   To be honest, but...
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:46.300]   As someone who has moderated content before, I have managed the Houston Chronicles comments
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.300]   section.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.500]   Did they give you a combat pay?
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.900]   They should have given you a combat pay.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.620]   You need a right-of-height for that kind of job.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.780]   It is not easy.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:04.660]   But the thing is, it's often not what you say, but how you say it that gets you in trouble.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:09.900]   A lot of people can say things that make other people angry and are offensive.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:15.660]   But if you don't couch it in a way that's threatening, if you state it as an idea that
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:21.940]   you want to discuss, if you're smart about it and don't do it with anger, you probably
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.260]   can stay on a platform like Twitter.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:30.700]   But it's when you become abusive, when you threaten people, when you threaten violence.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:34.460]   They have every right in the world to kick you off their platform.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.140]   It is their platform.
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:42.020]   They want to create a specific kind of community with a specific kind of vibe and feeling.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.780]   And if you're messing that up, you're out of there.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:50.020]   And Twitter, the problem with Twitter and the way they handle Alex Jones before is that
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.060]   they were kind of feeling guilty about it.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:59.060]   Jack Dorsey wanted to show, hey, we're being fair, but sometimes you can't be fair in those
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.660]   circumstances and then still be fair to everybody else on your system.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.420]   And you have to make the hard decision.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.420]   And they finally did it.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:11.900]   It is a shame that it took Jack Dorsey getting harassed to get Alex Jones out of there.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.660]   And Apple removed his app too, that same as well.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.260]   So he has a much smaller audience.
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.980]   Well, the new talking point of response to all this among certain elements of the right,
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.860]   I think that's a polite way of saying it, is that Twitter and Facebook should be treated
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.860]   as utilities.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.860]   And some of the--
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:27.860]   The bottom was saying something about this.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.180]   They should be nationalized, which coming from him is quite a vault fast.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.980]   So what I was going to say is I can't believe I'm going to say this.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:40.340]   There is actually a legitimate discussion to be had about where and when people have
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.820]   the right to a public space.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:48.140]   For example, there have been stories about people kicked out of shopping malls for trying
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.980]   to hold events there where the shopping mall manager is like, no, you can't have an event
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.620]   here because this is a private property.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.300]   We know we position ourselves as a community space, but we're not.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:03.660]   We're actually a business and only some types of activities are here.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:08.380]   So I don't think it hurts to have a discussion about what constitutes a public space, especially
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:13.420]   when so much of our public dialogue is shifting to these companies.
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:20.020]   But at the same time, if you're going to treat social media companies like utilities, why
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.020]   are you not actually starting with telecom and making broadband a utility and wiring
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.020]   the US?
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.700]   That's what the tell goes, how to make a huge amount of money.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:32.260]   I would argue that's a poor urgent priority in making sure that Steve Bannon can get unfettered
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.180]   access to Twitter or whatever.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.180]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.180]   But yeah.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.020]   This goes back to what I was trying, maybe not doing a great job of making earlier about
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.020]   Google showing up because I think Dwight's right that it was all political theater and
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.020]   stupid stuff.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.720]   But I mean, you don't want to give any fodder to the argument that you need to be heavily
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.500]   regulated from the government on down because the government will not do a good job of it.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.820]   And the irony here is that this is the argument that political conservatives in America have
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:58.140]   traditionally made an opposition to government influence in private business and private
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.140]   enterprise.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.980]   Remember the whole, you know, they pick winners and losers as an anti-argument to government
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.980]   influence?
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:08.060]   This is the opposite of that advocacy and favor of it to correct a perceived wrong shadow
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.860]   banning that isn't even happening per the companies themselves.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:15.140]   So we've reached kind of the peak of Mount stupid.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.940]   And there's the title for the show.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.940]   There's the title for the show.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:24.820]   This stuff is infuriating to explain the same stuff tariffs, the same ideas free speech,
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.420]   where it applies, and the same idea of private companies again and again and again to an
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.060]   audience that remixes them in the wrong way each time and then claims political grievance.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.020]   Well, they made sure they would tear out my last five hairs because I'm going to kind
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.020]   of...
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.300]   It's an effort to preserve power.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.100]   It's let's bring the system in our favor so long as we're in charge.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.580]   It's the gerrymandering of tech.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:47.100]   Well, speaking on that thing, we also had the hearings for the next Supreme Court justice
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.100]   in Washington.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:54.460]   And Kavanaugh's testimony was a masterful account of Weasel words to avoid actually asking
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:55.980]   answering questions.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:00.620]   But then emails leaked out that he'd done from 10 years before, 5 years before, that
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:05.540]   she showed him, well, lying would possibly be too strong, but at least being economical
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:10.380]   with the truth when it came to his testimony for the actual congressional hearings.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.260]   It's like, bearing in mind, I mean, this guy is fairly young.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.580]   He's no doubt fairly healthy.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.580]   He's going to be running things for the next...
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.380]   He's going to be on the court for the next 40 years.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:22.940]   Given some of these emails about his views towards online surveillance, targeting, that
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.380]   sort of thing, certainly net neutrality, is this something?
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.980]   I mean, is he going to get in your...
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:31.980]   I'm not an American person, but I mean, does it look like this could be our next Supreme
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:32.980]   Court justice?
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.980]   Yes.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.980]   I mean, it's 99% chance, right?
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.980]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:41.980]   It's unfortunately yes, because they've got the woman from Maine who's a former priest
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.980]   or sinnerist.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:43.980]   Oh, Ms. Carro.
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.980]   They've got Collins on lock, I think.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.980]   Interesting.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.980]   I did it.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.620]   No, it's speaking of political theater, what Cory Booker did when he was like, "Yeah,
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.980]   you know, I'm just releasing these.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:52.980]   Feel free.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.980]   Do what you want with them."
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.180]   That was a nice bit of political theater this week.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.140]   There was a lot of acts of that particular theater.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.140]   Yes.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.480]   And it's too bad it's come to that as opposed to having a hundred thousand different
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.180]   documents which should have been open to the public.
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:10.540]   Literally released documents, I think, the day before the hearing.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.540]   Four to two thousand and like an hour before or something.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.540]   No, it was...
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.580]   What do we think about Tim Wu's idea that Facebook should be broken up?
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.060]   Because Tim Wu was big in the net neutrality discussion that we mentioned just a minute
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.780]   ago with broadband and utilities.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.620]   This smacks to me of Microsoft in the 90s.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:27.620]   And...
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.140]   Yeah, but when it happened to Microsoft in the 90s in the US, pretty much they got away
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.140]   with it.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.140]   And then you just took a massive e-find.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.480]   And they came back more powerful than ever before.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.240]   I mean, you guys were reporting before I was.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.240]   I'm deferring here.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.240]   Well, okay.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.840]   I mean, certainly it was being talked about, but it was the EU which actually brought the
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.760]   fines and forced Microsoft to disengage the browser.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.080]   The US were kind of like, "Well, it's kind of naughty, but you know what?
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.840]   It's not that naughty?"
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.040]   Yeah, yeah, just try and sort it out.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.280]   But yeah, I just don't see how it would work.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.040]   Well, how would you bring it up?
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.940]   Well, how would you take Instagram as a separate company?
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.780]   Yeah, I think there's three companies there.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.780]   Yeah, we'll stop Instagram.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.780]   Yeah, we'll stop Instagram.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.780]   Exactly.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:09.780]   There's three properties.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.300]   Facebook is essentially the whale of the group in the gambling terminology.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.260]   And that's a big cash flow that will eventually decline.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.060]   Instagram is a rising star breaking out into television and the new e-commerce app that
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.060]   Casey Newman wrote about for the Verge.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:25.820]   And WhatsApp is the international multilingual power play that exists from India all the
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:26.820]   back to Pittsburgh.
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.460]   So there's three companies there inside of One House.
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.640]   WhatsApp is also the growth engine right now.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.920]   So I don't think, I think Facebook would fight it mostly because Instagram and WhatsApp
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.640]   are where the future of the revenue is going.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.760]   Yeah, and Facebook has a lot more power than any regulator does.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.600]   They're not going to get broken up, but the idea is fascinating because once again, this
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.600]   is coming up.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.600]   Are these companies too big?
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   Is Amazon monopoly?
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.600]   It's not.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.600]   Etcetera, et cetera.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.160]   But this is a conversation, again, back to the idea of people being stupid that we're
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.520]   going to have for a long time, I think.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.520]   Thanks, sir.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.520]   I mean, Dwight, what's your view on this?
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.440]   Because I mean, it's, you've been around in the business, I think probably along the
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.440]   other than any of us.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.180]   And you've seen them, but we've seen this with Microsoft.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.340]   We've seen with calls, I mean, help.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:08.260]   Those rumors that Microsoft was just keeping Apple afloat just so it could avoid antitrust
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.820]   action back in the late '90s.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.500]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.900]   So I think one of the things I think is that yes, it owns WhatsApp and Instagram.
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.900]   And there's a little bit of cross play between Facebook and Instagram in some of its products.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:27.420]   But I don't necessarily see the same thing that was happening with Microsoft or Microsoft
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:34.120]   was using the presence of its browser to keep other, to keep competing browsers ineffective
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:38.200]   and off of Windows.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.400]   It owns all three companies, but they're fairly distinct.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.040]   In fact, if you talk to a lot of Instagram users, they're not even aware that Facebook
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.080]   owns Instagram.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.800]   And so I'm not necessarily sure that one is that they're leveraging one to do the other.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.240]   The one thing that they have done is they purchase these companies smartly.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:03.280]   They do that these companies were growth companies and that they would dominate their space
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.920]   if they had not already been doing so at the time.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.840]   And so I think they have been smart in that sense.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.480]   But I don't see them leveraging one thing to keep competitors away.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.920]   They're just there and they're just doing very well.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:19.360]   Yeah, the old Cisco model whereby you buy up the competition as it emerges.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.320]   I can remember thinking the price they paid for Instagram at the time was insane.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.600]   It's about a billion dollars back before that was the thing.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.600]   And then WhatsApp, the price was really insane.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.000]   The 19 billion dollars they have made a profit out of both and a hefty one as well.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.840]   They've been pretty well.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.920]   The only caveat to that, to my comment that they're not one that's not leveraging the
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:44.640]   other is that they clearly have been predatory in terms of features.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.560]   So I think you can really argue that Snapchat has been wounded by the features that have
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:55.000]   been added to Instagram and that some of which are now available in Facebook itself.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.520]   So in that sense, I think you can look at it like that.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.680]   But I haven't read Wu's piece.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:06.280]   I'm not sure what he argues in terms of why they should be broken up.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:12.320]   But I think that probably it is not at all yet on the level that Microsoft and Internet
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.480]   Explorer was in the 90s.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.520]   The crux of the piece, what he's looking at now is he's explaining the idea that the
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.000]   law should prioritize competition.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.600]   And that said, can you plausibly make the case that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.600]   have eliminated competition?
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.440]   I think if you look at the pitiful amount of numbers, people using Google+, that would
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.640]   certainly be a sort of a little...
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.000]   Or you could look at Snapchat's or Snap stock price as another...
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Right.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.720]   I think the answer is not yet.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.560]   I thought the Snapchat stock price was done in by Kylie Jenner.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.240]   I didn't think Facebook had a message to tell me that.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.240]   Maybe it was Elon Musk this time.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.080]   It's a safe bet these days.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   It is.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   It is kind of who to blame.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   Ah, Elon.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.280]   The reason why I wanted to cite this is that Tim Wu is a very important public intellectual
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.120]   in the tech policy space.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.360]   And so to see him use the Verge, which is a big platform to make this point, is a strong
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.360]   statement.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.360]   And one that we should keep in mind as we...
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.360]   I know we all like, you know, gadgets and gizmos and kind of the cool bits of tech.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:15.960]   But this political stuff really impacts the flow of who builds stuff and what you get
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.960]   to use.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.040]   Now, it's a bit before all that stuff comes out, but it still really matters.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:25.000]   Well, at the end of the article, House Singer notes that we actually have a better antitrust
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.080]   case against Amazon because they're arguing that companies like Zappos and diapers.com
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:34.000]   would not have had to sell themselves to Amazon if they felt that the market was still going
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.200]   to work in their favor or if they felt that the competition was still possible.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.200]   Amazing, though.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.800]   Walmart's huge e-commerce push by and things like jet.com.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   No, no one says anything about that, though.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.680]   Is creating the Apple to Microsoft in the '90s for Amazon by creating a second player in
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.080]   the e-commerce space that they can cite as a theoretical or a punitive competitor.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.560]   But I think we all know that Amazon has about like half the US e-commerce.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.560]   So it's really...
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:01.800]   Their market penetration is pretty heavily weighted towards upper income deciles.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.440]   And so what you're looking at is Walmart...
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:10.960]   They could probably comfortably coexist with Walmart penetrating from solid middle class
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.920]   on down and Amazon penetrating from solid middle class on up.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.920]   Quippling.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.680]   The point is that neither one of them is going to want that.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.680]   I was back to say, yeah.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.680]   Amazon Sherry.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.160]   It just doesn't sound like a thing that actually happens in the upper culture.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.440]   No, I get the feeling that Jeff Bezos was either an only child or one who didn't really
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.080]   get that whole sharing thing.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.280]   I feel like this show is going to get me one of us in trouble.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:35.120]   How is he going to react when he gets to space and discovers there are other species?
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   Well, they'll sell them stuff.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.160]   They're still that wonderful show though.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.960]   They'll sell them stuff.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.640]   There's that wonderful shot of him in sort of 1998 with this sort of floppy head guy.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.640]   Just like, I want to sell books online and then that ripped shot of him from last year.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.640]   Like this is...
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.640]   I want to sell whatever the F I want.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:56.400]   It's like Linda Hamilton and the Terminator 2 where you're like, "Whoa, what happened to you?"
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.800]   This is what a billion dollars worth of fitness and like pre-mate, yeah.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.560]   Like the higher a chef, you can look like that.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.960]   Or we're going to discover in like three or four years that he's actually had all
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   like a genetic engineering startup on the side and he's made himself the first test subject.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.760]   Maybe he would place himself with a robot like Mark.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.320]   I thought Larry Ellison had beaten Mr. Beaten everyone to buy a show.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.200]   No, Larry Ellison has been devil in a human suit.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.600]   I thought Larry Ellison was sailing the high seas with his yachts and his catamaran.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.000]   He's getting in and cheating that the America's cup.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   I want to stop talking smack for him.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   I just want to be random.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   I just want to be random.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   I just want to be random.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Okay, right.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.480]   It seems like a good idea to take a break and speak to some of the sponsors that make this
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.480]   podcast possible.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.480]   So here's Leo to tell you what it's all about.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.320]   I showed it a brought to you by rocket mortgage from quick and loans.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:40.840]   Let's talk about buying a house for a minute because of rising interest rates.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.320]   This is something new in the market, right?
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.320]   There's a lot of unpredictability when it comes to buying that new home.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.400]   It's causing a lot of anxiety with people.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:54.600]   Well, the good people of quick and loans know that and because they're very customer-centric,
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.920]   they're focused on your experience.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.200]   They're doing something about it.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.320]   They call it the power buying process.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.520]   And here's how it works.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:06.240]   Second loans will verify your income, assets, and credit in less than 24 hours and they'll
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.840]   give you verified approval.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.200]   Now that means now you have the strength of a cash buyer.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.040]   You are in lack Flynn, man.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:18.720]   You can go there with that letter, give it to the seller's realtor, and they'll put you
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.440]   right at the top of the list because you got them, you're good for it.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.720]   You've got verified approval.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.840]   Once you're verified, this is how they take the anxiety out of home shopping.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.240]   You qualify for their all-new exclusive rate shield approval.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:38.080]   They'll lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.040]   If rates go up, your rate stays the same.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.000]   If rates go down, your rate drops.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.240]   But either way, you win.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:50.320]   It's exactly what you'd expect from America's number one mortgage lender, the biggest, the
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.120]   best, quick and loans, and rocket mortgage.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.200]   You get started right now.

[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.880]   And the number two.

[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:31.800]   For assembling this fine panel today, now I send you back to Ian Thompson.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   Ian.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   A fine panel.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.520]   It's very nice of you indeed, Lear.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.400]   Right, as I say, we have the panel here and ready to go.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.640]   And the final bit of news out from Washington came late in the week, but it was the news
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.560]   that apparently the US intelligence services have identified.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:51.260]   One of the North Korean hackers accused of not only hacking Sony pictures, but also the
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:57.280]   WannaCry ransomware outbreak, the $81 million heist against a Bangladeshi bank and many,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   many more computer crimes.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.080]   Now, Parkey and Yok, I've probably pronounced that wrong.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.920]   We'll probably not be leaving the borders of North Korea or as best Korea as I understand
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.240]   they call themselves, if without the slightest hint of irony.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:16.680]   I mean, do statements like this actually help because this guy is never leaving Korea
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.680]   now?
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.440]   We're never probably going to get our hands on him.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:23.520]   I think the fact that we can chase down who it was individually shows that we can see
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.820]   through things.
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.620]   And so maybe people will be less incentivized to try things they might have thought they
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.100]   could get away with, but in fact, we know exactly what's going on.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.620]   So the idea is that by putting out the wanted poster, what the government is doing is sending
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.740]   a message saying, we'll figure out who you are.
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:37.740]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:38.740]   And if we can get to you, we will.
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.100]   And during our next round of sanctions talk, we're going to have another set of things
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.100]   to talk about.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.100]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:47.660]   I mean, these sort of hacking incidents, whenever they happen, the news flares up around them.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.920]   It talks about them, and one cry was an enormous deal for about 12 minutes.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:55.060]   I felt like, well, no, I mean, it very nearly shut down huge chunks of the British National
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.060]   Health Service.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.240]   It was only thanks to Marcus Hutchins and a couple of other people.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:03.060]   We actually stopped in his tracks, but yeah, it was a huge deal.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.580]   And then it wasn't all of a sudden.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:07.340]   Like I feel like once we get under control, I mean, he's sending the text to actually
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:10.240]   fix the things everyone else goes, aha, and the news is on.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.240]   It's too bad.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.780]   I think that people forget because like you pointed out, it very nearly brought down health
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:20.300]   services, most computing environments are heterogeneous, where you'll have machines
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:25.060]   that are 10 to 12 years old, all the way to machines that are 10 to 12 days old.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:30.500]   And what hackers can do is they can exploit this because you're not going to have one
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.780]   security protocol that one size fits all.
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:33.780]   And it can have terrible results.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.740]   I mean, imagine if they had gotten to the point where they were shutting down power or
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:42.220]   racing medical records for like a pediatric ICU or something like that.
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:43.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:47.380]   And when, you know, I know the way we covered it was, oh, there's a patch.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.900]   Here's what you can do.
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.020]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:54.100]   But what I would like to see are follow ups where you talk to the companies that got affected
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.180]   and how many man hours of work did you lose?
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.940]   What was the bottom line?
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.860]   What people were affected by these systems being down?
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:05.460]   And so something like this where they're like, look, we've identified people who can
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.380]   do this kind of damage and we will find you.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.940]   And we will talk to you very sternly through a press release.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:11.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.940]   That's right.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.940]   You can see it.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:14.940]   You can see it.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.540]   Because we haven't gotten to the point where we have like a massage, a massage like apparatus
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.380]   in place to, to extra to, to take you from the country.
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.780]   That's a very dangerous road to go to.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.780]   Exactly.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:25.780]   That's an Israeli special forces.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:26.780]   They will come in.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:27.780]   They'll steal you.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:28.780]   And they're fantastic.
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.140]   Dwight, I mean, why do you stand on this?
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.940]   Because it's obviously very contentious topic.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.100]   But do you think it helps?
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.500]   I'm just saying.
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.620]   I think that, you know, it does say, yeah, we will find you.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:39.620]   That's about as far as it goes.
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:43.300]   Now they have to find them if they arrest them and catch them.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.900]   You know, that will be, that will be the ultimate.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:52.140]   But I liked, I liked the list of stories that we should have been doing afterwards.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.220]   The Lisa came up with.
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.420]   And one of them should also be, how have things changed?
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:01.460]   Because I would suspect that in a lot of cases, not very much.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.460]   No.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.460]   No, this is it.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:07.220]   I mean, Bruce Schneier of the famous security guru has a new book out called Click Here
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.220]   to Kill Everyone.
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:13.620]   And it's basically looking at how this is going to impact us.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:17.540]   We've got millions of devices that are unsecured, that are unpaturable.
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:21.340]   And no one's really got an incentive to patch them.
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:25.660]   Because what you need is, you know, because if you're a manufacturer, that costs time
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:30.180]   and money and you're really just about selling the devices moving on and going to the next
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.180]   one.
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:34.100]   And if you're a government, then it's quite handy to have some things like this around.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:38.060]   But once this goes mega, I mean, he calls it Internet Plus.
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:42.340]   Well, there are industries who use industry-specific software.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:47.660]   And I've read of use cases where there are people who are still running Macintosh computers
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:54.620]   from the 1990s because the software developer never made an OS 10 version of their software.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:56:00.420]   And so in granted, nobody is busy trying to break into your performa from 1995.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:01.980]   That's not happening.
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:05.580]   But this is one of the reasons why a cry was such a... because people were still using
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:07.540]   XP and paying Microsoft for the update.
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.540]   Right.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:13.260]   Because if you are a school system or a local government or a community of a hospital,
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:18.940]   you don't have the IT budget to continue the kind of tech churn that an operating system
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.420]   vendor is going to expect you to have.
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.580]   Or even that a software maker is going to expect you to have.
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.940]   And even when you upgrade, it might be one thing for like, "Oh, good news.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:30.660]   Our school system is finally moving up to Windows 10."
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:37.220]   But if the software that you use to log attendance and student grades only runs on Windows XP
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:43.180]   or Windows 8, then you're heavily disincentivized because the whole point to upgrading your system
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.180]   is gone.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.180]   It's not going to help.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:50.220]   And you're like, "Well, I will take my chance with the odd virus or I can completely
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:54.820]   shut down a school system, go back to the school board, ask for another $10 million,
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:59.340]   make the case, and tell them, "We're worried that some kid with a keyboard might bring
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.340]   us down in a couple years."
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:04.100]   Although it seems that if you go to most school boards in the US and ask for $10 million,
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:06.100]   are today fast out laughing?
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:13.300]   But this is the reality of a lot of tech ecosystems in the US is, again, you're not
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.220]   going through a whole lot of, you don't have infinite IT budget.
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:22.100]   And if you are the end IT user, you are dealing with a hardware vendor.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:25.180]   They may or may not be the same person as your OS vendor, who is definitely not the same
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:27.660]   person as your software vendor.
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.260]   And I think the fantasy that persists in some of these companies that they've locked down
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.260]   the whole channel.
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:36.700]   Well, you had this with the National Academy of Sciences report this week that said, basically,
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.820]   electronic voting isn't going to be secure by 2020.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.500]   We should all go back to a paper ballot system.
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.500]   Absolutely.
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:43.500]   We should go and mail in ballots.
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.500]   I'm secure of that.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.180]   Honestly, paper ballots I'm fine with.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.740]   Alex, do you take a view on this?
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.380]   Oh, I mean, I'm a huge paper ballot fanatic.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.940]   I mean, the worst thing I've heard in technology recently, which is a huge prize to win, was
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:54.620]   like, "Let's do voting on the blockchain."
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:55.620]   Ah!
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.620]   Which is just...
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.780]   Say blockchain to me one more time.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:00.780]   I double dare you.
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.780]   No, I don't want to...
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:02.780]   I can be punched.
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:03.780]   I don't want that.
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.500]   I think voting by mail is great.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.820]   I grew up in Oregon, which is a state that has a universal voting by mail, and I vote
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.820]   by mail in California.
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:11.820]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:12.820]   It's 100%.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:13.820]   And it's great.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.460]   We don't need to do anything else.
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.780]   And the thing that, you know, e-voting won't be safe by 2020.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:20.260]   It won't be safe by 2,200.
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:21.260]   Yeah.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:24.580]   I mean, the American electoral process is a prize, as we have seen in recent moments.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:29.060]   That people will want to exploit for their gain or to cause disharmonating disunion.
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:33.820]   So why would we make it more hackable and target the bull when we know it's going to
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.260]   be a hacked target?
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.260]   So let's just use paper.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.340]   Paper, by the way, comes from trees.
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:42.060]   And if you don't know this, we grow a lot of those in America, and we have enough to
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:44.220]   make enough ballots for ever.
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:45.220]   No shortage.
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.220]   100% coverage.
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.220]   It'll be great.
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:48.220]   It isn't...
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.220]   It's a tree.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.220]   It's a renewable resource.
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:51.220]   You can grow them.
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:52.220]   You can grow them.
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.220]   If you make a little tree and you put it in the ground, it makes a bigger tree in time.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.220]   Lots of ballots.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:58.180]   It's a river drive through Washington State, just the acres and acres of managed forests
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.300]   with the sign saying, "This is getting cut down this year.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.300]   This is planted this year.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.300]   It's amazing."
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.300]   Although, it's not paper voting.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.300]   Or a band of paper companies.
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:05.300]   Or a band of paper companies.
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:06.300]   It was actually...
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:10.660]   There was an interesting talk at Schmook on earlier at the start of the year about this.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.660]   The old Florida voting machines that caused all the initial panic in 2000, where you
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:19.220]   actually had to physically punch through the paper, actually had a primitive denial
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.780]   of service attack built in.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:26.020]   If you had a really popular candidate, then the space behind his paper got full of these
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.860]   little punches and it became harder and harder to push through the paper to actually get
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.860]   your vote registered.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:34.540]   Then we had the hanging chads and all that malarkey.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.940]   What do you stand on this twite?
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:37.900]   Electronic or paper?
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:40.100]   I think electronic with paper.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:44.860]   I think that you, if you have a paper backup, which is how a lot of systems are going now,
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.300]   I think that that's good.
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:52.500]   The problem is you don't even have to actually hack a system in order to create an issue.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:57.460]   All you have to do is make people think that the system is insecure.
[00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:03.140]   The discussions that we've been having this past year, that no election system is secure,
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:09.100]   that everything is hackable, that you can't trust your election system, is ultimately,
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.780]   I think, going to come back to bite us.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:17.180]   That way, the system that we have cold deer, we don't trust anymore.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.100]   Well, that's my concern.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.100]   This is the organ democracy.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.180]   This is how we breed in and out of the country.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.420]   You don't even actually have to do it.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.620]   You don't actually have to do it.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:33.900]   The stuff the Russians were doing in 2016, they never actually got into an election system
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:39.300]   that we know of and changed any votes, but they didn't have to because they created chaos
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.740]   around the system.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.220]   That's all you have to do.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:44.940]   It's a lower target that has the same price.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:49.100]   It's a good point, but also if they wanted to hack and change the votes, given how every
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.580]   single attend there's a kind of a black hat hackathon, they go, "We have to vote a machine
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.580]   in four seconds.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.580]   Ha ha.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.940]   I'm curious if it's not a technical impossibility.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.260]   Maybe it could happen in the future.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.260]   That worries me."
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.260]   No.
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.380]   Rather, literally grab a pen and vote.
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:06.660]   If it costs a little bit more money to do at the national and state level, that's a really
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.660]   good thing to spend money on.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:13.420]   I mean, obviously no election is perfect and back in the day then there were ballot stuffing
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:19.060]   where they get armies of people to vote on ballots before the election, stuff them into
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:23.220]   ballot boxes, but that required armies of people to do it and in an age where everyone's got
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.780]   a smartphone, then someone's going to take a few photos of this and put it around and
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.980]   it easily comes out.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:31.420]   With electronic voting, it's so easy to change it.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:35.340]   And to not leave a trail, which means you can't figure out how it was done and make sure
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.340]   it doesn't happen again.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:44.260]   The Defcon voting village last month, and it was just an 11-year-old managed to get into
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:51.660]   a mock-up of the state election system and change the votes to make dark tangent the
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.860]   next Senate candidate.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.540]   And it was so easy to do.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.300]   Nobody seems, only a couple of months ago, Congress voted down and said, "No, no, we
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.020]   don't need to spend any more money on this."
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.020]   I'm curious.
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:08.260]   There was that vote was dumb on a lot of levels.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.060]   And I don't understand.
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:15.020]   I'm still baffled as to why it went that way when we have had nothing but coverage on how
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:20.260]   vastly insecure our election system is, how our 2016 elections were systematically under
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:25.260]   attack from state actors and how the incentive to do that hasn't gone away.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.260]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.380]   I'm also curious how they got the 11-year-old to stop playing Fortnite long enough to hack
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.380]   the voting machine.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:34.620]   It was like an enders game type thing where he thought he was playing Fortnite, but it
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.180]   was the end of the novel.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.660]   It turns out those were the formats.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.660]   It wasn't a game.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.660]   No, it turns out those were the electors.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.260]   I'm going to say, it was really encouraging at the election seeing how many, you know,
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.260]   rounds of youngsters were around.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:50.260]   I mean, there were some talks that you couldn't get into unless you had a child with you.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:53.940]   And people get really asked you, by the way, if you asked to borrow theirs for an hour,
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.940]   but...
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:55.940]   Could I borrow your child?
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.940]   It just...
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.940]   But I mean...
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.940]   You're just asking the wrong people.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.940]   Wow.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:00.940]   You're just comparing who is more than three.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.940]   They're like, yeah, you can have two here.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.740]   It was a good run.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:05.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:06.740]   You're seven.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.740]   Good luck in the world.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.380]   Just see heels disappearing over the horizon to a dust cloud.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.180]   This is the age of reason in the middle ages.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.180]   You're fine.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.180]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.500]   But yeah, I mean, we've had paper balance.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.540]   They worked for plenty of years.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:22.020]   I mean, Dwight, you've got some serious elections, some seriously close elections going
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.020]   on down there and also some very weird tactics as I understand it.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.020]   Oh, man.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.060]   I understand that you guys are turning into California with your tofu.
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.580]   Here's my phone.
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:32.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:39.700]   The thing is, yeah, Ted Cruz said this weekend that he was worried that Beto O'Rourke would
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:45.220]   turn Texas into California with silicon, tofu, and dyed hair.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:52.420]   I would love to invite Ted into the Montrose community in Houston where there's plenty of
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:56.220]   silicon, tofu, and dyed hair already.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.460]   It's already happened, Ted, under your watch.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.460]   And it's just going to get more.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.700]   Beto is really interesting.
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:08.460]   He's kind of become kind of the Kennedy of Texas.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.460]   Wow.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.780]   He certainly airs a striking resemblance to it.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.940]   He's been spending a lot of time on the road.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:20.700]   And what's interesting is he doesn't avoid the red counties and the red cities.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:25.420]   He goes into these towns and talks to people who are openly hostile to him.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.380]   And oftentimes wins them over.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:33.820]   And it's really, really hard for a Democrat to win a statewide office in Texas.
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.460]   It has not happened in a long time.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:41.620]   And it has a chance to happen now, but I still would be surprised if he won.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:44.100]   Well, I'm glad you brought that up because there's been some...
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.340]   This has been a fascinating election in terms of electronic campaigning because there was
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:53.980]   a thing last week, I think, where the Cruz campaign took out a post-down social media,
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:57.380]   a picture of this Beppo character in a punk band as he was.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.380]   Beaters are...
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.580]   They all succeeded at making him look really cool.
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.740]   I was going to say, it's just like, who doesn't want to be in a punk band?
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.220]   And they're twins who can do that.
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.220]   He's wearing a dress.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.220]   He's got this little bit of facial hair.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.220]   And I'm like, Ted Cruz is just the most boring person alive in comparison to this punk rock.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.140]   Except for that period where he was killing people in San Francisco.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.140]   When he was the zodiac killer.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.140]   He was not the zodiac killer.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.940]   I just really, really think that meme is hysterical.
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.100]   Because it signifies a lot.
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:27.420]   Being this back to what we care about in terms of net neutrality, which is one of my pet issues,
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:32.260]   Ted Cruz, the senator in question, had one of the best quotes from 2014 about net neutrality.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.260]   And I've been...
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.260]   Ooh, it's been shit.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.260]   You have a dear to my heart.
[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.260]   This is a tweet.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.260]   I'm going to read it.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.500]   "Net neutrality is Obamacare for the internet."
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:43.740]   Again, one of those tweets that just gets everything wrong at once.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:47.860]   Well, the thing that's interesting is Obamacare has been incredibly popular.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.700]   You look at the public mobilization for it every time it's threatened.
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:55.340]   And if you position net neutrality that way, people are like, "Oh, really?"
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:59.460]   The difference though is it's much easier to explain healthcare as you know than internet
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:00.460]   regulation.
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.180]   And also, the telcos, as we pointed out earlier, in the program have an enormous lobbying budget
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.620]   and can force it in a way.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:09.420]   But I just, Ted Cruz, for whatever you think about him politically, outside of tech, inside
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:14.060]   of tech is wrong on net neutrality then, and also wrong now on social media regulations.
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.060]   Well, the telcos.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:18.980]   The telcos had inadvertently made an argument a couple of weeks ago for net neutrality when
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:22.140]   the Santa Clara Fire Department pointed out the Verizon Throttle.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:23.140]   Oh, yes.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.140]   They're communications.
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:26.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.900]   The largest wildfire in California history, Verizon, they're data rates down to virtually zero.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:29.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:36.780]   And so being able to say, and it was a contractual mess, but the way it can easily be packaged
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:42.900]   and reported to a public is along the lines of, "Look, telcos can decide the interest of
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:46.100]   public safety more than your fire departments or your police departments can.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:51.060]   Do you really want taxpayers to pay that much more money during emergencies because telcos
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.140]   view an opportunity for profit?"
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:56.380]   Like that is, that's what comes out of this.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.420]   Yeah, but that wasn't actually a net neutrality issue per se.
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.580]   They followed the contractual rules.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.620]   And so Verizon, I think, has landed with the big egg on its face.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.780]   And I used to work there, so I have no particular love for the company because they bought AOL
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:08.780]   and whatever, whatever.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.380]   But I saw a lot of stuff about that.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:15.100]   That was a net neutrality issue when it wasn't, it was universal throttling.
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:18.500]   If they thottled just one service, that would be a net neutrality violation.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.700]   Do I think Verizon's unlimited plans are weird?
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.700]   Yes.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.660]   Is it dumb to have three different unlimited plans?
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.660]   Sure.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.660]   Yes.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.660]   Et cetera, et cetera.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.660]   What is wrong with unlimited, unlimited, unlimited, unlimited, a caveat.
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:32.300]   But what I am saying is it would not be that hard to make to save.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.380]   This is what happened during the Santa Clara fires.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:39.080]   The fire department could not get access to data when they needed it to coordinate critical
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.140]   life-saving firefighting.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:46.500]   You don't want telcos gouging you at a time like this and under the law, as it stands,
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500]   now they can do that.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.500]   Oh, that, that is terrible.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:53.900]   The Verizon did is a basically handed weapons to anyone who wants to regulate telcos and
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.940]   make cases for here are how they should behave in times of national emergency, here is how
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:02.700]   they should behave in declared states of emergency, here is how they should behave at
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:03.700]   this point.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:09.700]   And the FCC has been pretty good about knocking down companies where they let the 9/11 service
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:10.700]   drop.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.860]   Sorry, 9/11 really does apply to something else in the American.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.420]   I still can't get used to your phone.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.420]   That's not meant to be a joke.
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:18.420]   I'm just kidding.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:19.420]   No, no, no, no, no, no, certainly.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.580]   I mean, it's getting used to the American system of putting months before days, which
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.380]   seems completely logically bonkers.
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.380]   But what we do.
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:32.620]   One of the things that surprised me about that whole story was that the fire department
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:39.020]   had to buy a commercial data service from Verizon as opposed to there being a public
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:43.580]   service data package that has no restriction on it at all.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:49.700]   I mean, I think Verizon and all of the telcos should provide four fire departments and police
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.580]   departments unlimited data.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:54.940]   Just give it to them because it's in the public interest to do so.
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:58.580]   They're not going to be that big of a customer unless it's an emergency.
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.980]   We'll see you just as to why they won't do it because it's public interest as opposed
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:02.980]   to profit.
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.420]   Yeah, but there's also a lot of rules about how you can sell things to the government,
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.420]   right?
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.420]   Isn't like setting up private contracts.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:11.500]   I don't think I know enough to really comment on the exact intricacies, but you can't just
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.140]   sell anything at any price.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.380]   There's a lot of rules.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.220]   Asking anyone who sells to the government as opposed to private corporations, entirely
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.060]   different set of prices and so forth because just the way it's set up.
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.340]   But did Verizon definitely do something that was very poor for itself?
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.340]   Yes.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:28.860]   And this is one of those rare times in capitalism when in greed, conscious of the public interest,
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.540]   actually blew up in their face.
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:35.980]   And that's a moment in which we can maybe see some positive regulatory change on the road.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:39.740]   My afternoon search is failing me at the moment, but they're actually, for the telcos, there
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.500]   actually are service packages.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:46.180]   They do offer to fire departments, police departments, EMTs, things like that, which
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:52.460]   purportedly have different tiers for data, but probably did not anticipate the scope
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.260]   and scale of state wildfire fighting.
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.940]   And I'll keep looking to see if I can find the site.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:58.940]   Okay.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:09:59.940]   And I'll come to you.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:02.500]   But it comes down from a business perspective.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:07.260]   This is also not great for Verizon because AT&T cannot come in and go, you know, I understand
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:11.780]   California that you are on fire approximately 90% of the time.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.180]   We are happy to provide you with internet service.
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:18.500]   Here are our rates there, 50 cents per blah, blah, higher than Verizon's, but we don't
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.500]   throttle.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.020]   And then fire departments can be like, oh.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.940]   It does seem a bit weird when you've got firefighters who are risking their lives to
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:28.580]   look after us all and they just cannot get a signal these days.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.820]   Especially when their prisoners getting paid a dollar an hour.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:33.580]   So we're using one dollar a day or two dollars or two dollars a day.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:36.620]   And then they're not allowed to become firefighters because they have a prison record.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:39.620]   Yeah, it's it's bonkers America.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.620]   I feel like it's mine.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:44.820]   Okay, we'll come back to that a little while.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.820]   In the meantime, we've got another quick message from one of our sponsors, Leo, take it away.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:51.980]   Fellas, if I get in a rep for a moment, thank you, Ian.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:55.100]   I just want to tell you a little bit about our sponsor that people make this show possible.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.740]   Today, it's fresh books.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.740]   Fresh books.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:10:59.740]   I talk about it.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:03.660]   I was a fresh books customer when I for years when I went up to Canada to do the TV show
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.940]   call for help Canada.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.580]   And I had to build the folks in Canada for my time.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:11.300]   I travel my expenses and I was hating it.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.500]   I was it was painful at the end of the month.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.940]   And then Amber told me about a brand new company starting up in Toronto this back in
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.140]   2004 called Fresh Books.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.300]   Now, let me tell you about Fresh Books.
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:27.500]   Most accounting software is built, frankly, for accountants, not business owners.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:32.820]   Fresh Books is an owner first accounting platform that puts you the small business owner back
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.780]   in control of your business.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.420]   They call it approachable accounting.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:40.660]   It's full industry standard, double entry accounting, but don't put your fingers in
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:44.540]   years when I say that because you don't need to know that.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:50.220]   It's painless, automatic bookkeeping and reporting industry standard, but you don't have to be
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.980]   an accountant to use it.
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:56.460]   Quickly generate and access accounting reports like the general ledger trial balance chart
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:57.460]   of accounts.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.300]   Share the layer on the dashboard, share the reports with your account and your financial
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:03.380]   advisor, your tax prepare.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:07.060]   Of course, Fresh Books let you say, and this is how I started using it, professional invoices
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:08.260]   and seconds.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:12.460]   You could see invoices that have been sent invoices that have been paid invoices that
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:13.460]   are overdue.
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.540]   And this is the one I like invoices that have been viewed.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.380]   So your client can't say, well, I didn't get your invoice.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.380]   No, you did.
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.380]   You saw it.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.860]   You read it.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:23.140]   I know.
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:26.740]   Except online payments directly from the invoice.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:30.820]   Honestly, most clients do want to pay you.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:33.580]   But paying bills is annoying as making bills, right?
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:37.580]   So they put it off like I used to put off creating my invoices.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:42.380]   But with Fresh Books, because there's a button that says pay and they can do it online,
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:43.380]   you don't have to do anything.
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:44.940]   You don't have to set up an online account or anything.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:46.740]   They just have a Fresh Books account.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.220]   They press that button.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.220]   It's easy for them.
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.220]   And you know what?
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:54.180]   On average, you get paid twice as fast.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:13:00.100]   That alone should send you immediately to freshbooks.com/dwid.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.740]   You can create proposals.
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:06.220]   If you're looking for new clients with rich text content and images, you can even get
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.900]   e-signatures from clients if they accept a proposal.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:12.260]   That's all enabled just with the Fresh Books account.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:17.940]   Send invoices, send estimates, send proposals, all in multiple languages, multiple currencies.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.380]   This was big for me because I was billing in Canadian dollars and that was a pain to
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.380]   figure it all out.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.380]   Fresh Books just does it automatically.
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.980]   It's part of the deal.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.940]   Fresh Books also automatically connects to your bank account and updates expenses daily.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.300]   So you don't have to do all that data entry.
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.180]   You can import expenses in bulk.
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:39.260]   You can even with the Fresh Books app, take a picture of a receipt, upload it, and let
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:42.180]   Fresh Books do the rest.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:46.700]   This is so much better than doing it by hand.
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:51.060]   Keep tabs on your business no matter where you are with the Fresh Books mobile app.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.900]   If you're still conquering the day-to-day tasks of creating invoices and collecting payments,
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.980]   Fresh Books is the magic wand you're looking for.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.580]   It was for me.
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:03.020]   And if you have great ambitions and need robust accounting, Fresh Books will grow with
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.020]   you.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.220]   They do it all.
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:08.820]   No matter what your accounting needs are, Fresh Books will help put you in the driver's
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:11.020]   seat.
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.740]   I'm proud to say I've been using Fresh Books.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.940]   I started using it like I said in 2004.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.220]   I've been telling you about Fresh Books for many years.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:24.980]   There are now 24 million people who have used Fresh Books to painlessly send invoices,
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.380]   track, time, capture expenses, and then get back to doing what they love.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:30.380]   24 million!
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.100]   Nice job, Fresh Books.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:36.300]   I still have a soft spot in my heart for these guys.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.300]   They're great.
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.620]   Try Fresh Books Free for 30 days at freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.140]   Enter this week in tech.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.580]   There's a "How did you hear about a section?"
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:48.500]   So please put this week in tech in there so they know you heard it here.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.180]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.180]   Thank you, Fresh Books.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.180]   Keep up the good work, huh?
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:58.420]   Speaking of good work, back to you in Thompson.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:59.580]   Thank you very much, Leo.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.580]   It's right.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:05.300]   We've had a few more bits on and we actually have a live demo and thing.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:10.500]   Now I don't know if you've heard the International Space Station called "Leak" last weekend.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.380]   They didn't actually wake up the astronauts when they found it because it was such a small
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.380]   leak.
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:19.100]   They looked at first as though micrometerite had struck the space station.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:24.260]   Now these are very, very small pieces of material, sometimes even just paint flecks,
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:28.980]   but they're travelling at such a velocity that the kinetic energy they hold is massive.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:33.100]   They've actually managed to crack one of the windows in the ISS just with, as I say, a
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.100]   paint fleck.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:38.460]   But this hole appeared and they tracked it down to the Soyuz capsule which had recently
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:40.380]   docked with the ISS.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.420]   Now micrometerite is sort of thing, people are prepared.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.660]   So they actually fixed it.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:50.540]   First off, they stopped the hole by an astronaut putting his finger over the hole which seems
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.340]   a very low tech way of dealing with it.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.740]   Just leave them there to have their finger over the hole.
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:57.740]   It's like a carbonate fix.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:58.740]   I'm trying to get on there.
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:15:59.740]   No, no, just...
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.940]   Can you imagine you've got your PhD in astrophysics, you've been in the Air Force and done your
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:08.180]   100 hours of flight training and you've gone through and you've taken your NASA photo with
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:11.460]   your pet cat or whatever your photo is going to be and they're like, "What am I doing on
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:12.460]   this spaceship?"
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.420]   You're sticking your finger in the hole.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.020]   It was a very soon wind rod we trust.
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.020]   It's an easy turn to go home.
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.020]   You're doing it fast.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:24.500]   But anyway, they then took a slightly more high tech approach and used duct tape, rather
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.580]   the space equivalent of duct tape and you can see the stuff here.
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:31.140]   This is called Captain Tape.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.740]   It's called K-A-P-T-O-N.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:34.740]   Captain.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:41.380]   It was developed in the 1960s for the space program and the big advantage is that it has
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:45.980]   an enormously wide temperature operating range where it will still stay sticky.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:55.180]   The label informs me it's good for down to -452 in freedom units and as high as 752.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.060]   Somebody can translate that into Celsius.
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.260]   It's - - 32 plus 14.
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:02.660]   Oh, well that makes it perfectly simple.
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.040]   Why is America still on the Imperial system?
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.120]   Why are the 5,000 women done to the 80s?
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.580]   - This is so great! - The Miles.
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:11.420]   If you're on the audio recording,
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.380]   we're now playing with the tape on set.
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.900]   So, it looks like this beautiful shimmering role
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.940]   of coppery tape and then when you pull it out,
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:22.640]   it's this translucent yellow and it feels very 1960s,
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.480]   the future.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.040]   It was developed in the 1960s.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.360]   - Yes, that's why it'snetic in salt.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.680]   All spacecraft including New Horizons
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.940]   and the James Webb Space Telescope,
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.580]   the sun shield it's using to actually keep cool
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.340]   is made of this stuff covered in aluminium.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.660]   - It's so pretty.
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:38.820]   - In a very, very clean stream lined way.
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.140]   - I want it, but I don't know what I'm gonna use it for.
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:43.420]   So, it's just, I mean, it's just like--
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.460]   - Halloween costumes, I'm just trying.
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:46.980]   (laughing)
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.260]   Although, you know what just reminds me
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.740]   of one of the most exciting demos that Microsoft,
[01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:52.820]   not demos, but one of the most exciting research projects
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.740]   Microsoft has been doing with its HoloLens.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:58.700]   They're testing it for remote learning,
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:02.460]   both on undersea labs and up in the space station.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:05.780]   And the idea is that if you have the HoloLens
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:08.100]   and you've got the 3D learning environment,
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.900]   you can learn on the fly up there.
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:11.980]   So, instead of having to send up staffers
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:15.100]   with a wide array of specific and eclectic skills,
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:16.420]   you can send up a specialist.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:19.340]   And then if something breaks, you put on the HoloLens,
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.980]   you call your boys back in Houston,
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.820]   and they walk you through how to repair it.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:24.660]   - We see that.
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:25.820]   - And so, between that and 3D fabrication,
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:27.980]   which they're also experimenting with on the space station,
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.780]   they could, in theory, beam you,
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.500]   or they could beam the printer,
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.740]   the instructions to fabricate apart,
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:37.660]   and then they can have you walk you through how to fix it.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:41.500]   And that really opens up who can be on spaceships
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.500]   and what they can do.
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.340]   - Oh, certainly.
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:45.660]   - And in the case of this, they have actually fixed the whole,
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:48.100]   and they've worked out, they think where it came from.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.100]   Because at first, Michael Micrometerite,
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.140]   and then the second one, I know you love this story, Alex.
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.140]   - And this is so good.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:54.780]   - It is. - It's a great story.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.540]   - That apparently, one of the Russian workers
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:59.380]   putting the spacecraft together,
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:02.940]   accidentally drilled a hole in the skin of the spacecraft.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:05.060]   And rather than go to his boss and say,
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:09.020]   "Boss, I've kind of done a bit of a oopsie on this one."
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.620]   He just stuck some glue on it and said,
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.140]   "No one's ever gonna find out."
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:14.260]   And of course, the one in the spaceship was in space,
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:17.220]   the glue degraded, and then we got a spot.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.060]   So, Alex, how do you feel about Russian engineering
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:20.980]   at the moment?
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:22.300]   - I feel fine about it.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:23.140]   It was a small and a full,
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.140]   they didn't even wake up the astronauts.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:26.620]   But can you imagine the sink,
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:29.500]   that's right, the stomach descending feeling you would get
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.540]   if you drilled a hole in something that was going to space,
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:35.260]   that cost half of Kentucky to build.
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.460]   I think I would just find,
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:38.860]   well, I shouldn't make that joke on air,
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.940]   but I would not handle that stress well.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.740]   So I kind of empathize with the person,
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.740]   don't do that, don't tell your boss.
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:45.780]   This was not the right move,
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.620]   but oh Lord, do I understand?
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.460]   - Oh, indeed.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:53.140]   So, Dwight, you're from the home of the space command,
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:54.860]   as it were.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.660]   How are people handling this as an answer to that?
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:59.660]   I mean, duct tape, it just doesn't sound very, you know,
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.780]   space.
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.060]   - Well, I think they were very glad
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.460]   it happened on the Russian side.
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.460]   It means it's not on the US side.
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.540]   (laughing)
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.620]   My favorite part of the story is that they looked
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:11.020]   at the hole, and initially, yeah,
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.340]   they thought it was a meteorite,
[01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:15.300]   until somebody noticed that there were little skitter marks
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.220]   across the skin, the media,
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:18.700]   front to the hole where it had like,
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:19.860]   where the guy got, oops,
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:24.740]   and if you can imagine the feeling of the guy who did it,
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:27.220]   knowing that they found it,
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:28.780]   and the Russians have said,
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:31.540]   we're gonna find out who did this,
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.380]   and there will be repercussions.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.460]   Can you imagine what that feeling is like?
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:36.620]   - Especially in Putin's Russia,
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.020]   where repercussions don't tend to come
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:39.060]   with teddy bears and flowers.
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:39.900]   Yeah, it's like--
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:40.740]   - Have you ever?
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:41.580]   - Do you pull out a slide?
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:42.540]   - Do you think it's the history of Russia?
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:44.540]   It's not ever been--
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.620]   - I know Russian history best in the modern context,
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.380]   as opposed to the Tsar era, so--
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.460]   - Oh my gosh, there were a couple great series
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:52.260]   on Netflix that cover that,
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.460]   and the Ramonov Dynasty starts off
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:56.140]   with the guy who launched the Dynasty,
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:59.140]   hanging everybody else who would have threatened it,
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.140]   and have a little capacity,
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.340]   including a three-year-old.
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:02.180]   So--
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.020]   - Is it Ramonov or Ramonov?
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.820]   - It was a British person who was doing the--
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.500]   - Romanov is the way I was told to say it,
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.340]   but he just-- - They pronounced it
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.180]   Ramonov the whole time,
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.460]   and I was like, oh, well,
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.780]   you were closer to Russia than I am,
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:12.620]   I'm gonna take your--
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:13.780]   - Well, if you're looking for a new name
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:14.940]   for your startup, there you go.
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:15.780]   - Ramonov?
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:16.620]   - There you go.
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:17.460]   - There you go.
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:18.300]   - We'll go well in Russia.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:19.140]   - It's either a dinosaur, the Black Widow,
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.500]   one of the other.
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.340]   - And either way, okay.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.100]   - Just before this gets--
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:24.940]   - Marvly?
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:26.180]   - Yes, two morbid,
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.140]   actually sticking with morbid theme, in fact.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:28.980]   - Oh, good.
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:30.660]   - Theranos has finally shut down.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.540]   It's like, I'm amazed it was still going,
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.220]   maybe there's one person making the tea
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.260]   and just, you know,
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:37.380]   handling management tissues just,
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.260]   it was all going so well.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.900]   - Playing Taylor's so bad blood over and over again.
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:42.740]   - Yeah.
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:43.580]   (laughing)
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:44.420]   - Sorry.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:45.900]   - But I mean, Theranos was,
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.060]   it was a case in point where I think
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.860]   the entire tech industry had to look at itself
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.500]   and say, what did we do wrong with this?
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:56.180]   And it does appear that, you know--
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:57.660]   - She gamed it pretty successful.
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.540]   I mean, look, obviously the thing was made
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:00.460]   from smoke and mirrors,
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:03.420]   but you look at how cleverly she hacked
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.820]   the whole process of launching a startup,
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.140]   capturing the hype cycle, getting some funding
[01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.860]   and avoiding consequences for as long as she did.
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.460]   It's like she sat down
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:15.500]   and did a longitudinal study of how startups work.
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.340]   And then was like,
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:17.980]   I don't have to have an actual product.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:20.980]   All I have to do is nail these deliverables
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:24.180]   and keep this going for as long as I can.
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:26.500]   - It just seemed remarkable that it did go on
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.140]   as long as it did, but also--
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.260]   - Because she picked a subject
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:31.460]   that people didn't easily understand.
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:34.380]   Like a lay person can't easily explain,
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:37.500]   this is why assays take the time that they do.
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.300]   These are the steps involved in testing blood.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:41.700]   This is the amount that you need
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.700]   in order to get a decent sample size.
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.420]   Most people aren't going to know that
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.540]   or do the research on it.
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:49.220]   And so if you can go in and talk with authority.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:52.940]   - Well, Alex, you deal with new companies all the time.
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.180]   What were the warning signs
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.060]   that we already should have picked up on the Theranos?
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:57.580]   - I have something after that
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:01.140]   for what's happening to them now, but on that front,
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.020]   I think that what I would look for,
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.660]   I talked to a lot of startups
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.100]   and I cover early stage companies.
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.940]   It's kind of what I do.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.020]   It's something from a financial side.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:11.380]   So what I see is that if you have vanity board members,
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.820]   now if you recall Theranos had like Henry Kissinger
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:16.220]   on his board, now having a war criminal
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:19.060]   on your board in general, not so great.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.660]   But also what does he have to do with blood testing?
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:22.500]   And so the more you--
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.740]   - He created oceans of blood,
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:25.340]   so obviously you know how to test.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:28.340]   - He's tested blood generative, in a way.
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:30.340]   - I think calling it a thousand pound bombs,
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:33.420]   blood gendered devices is supposed to be even for--
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.780]   - I stopped in the middle of that phrase.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.860]   But companies that feel the need to pack their board
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:40.980]   with non-core people tend to be trying to cover up
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.060]   for something or puff themselves up to be more
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:43.900]   than they actually are.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.660]   - So to me, it's a bit of a--
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.180]   it's a front they put up.
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:49.540]   And the best companies that I know are always the companies
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.340]   that are the most transparent, that work the hardest
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:54.540]   and that don't do things like that.
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:57.180]   They're not looking for fake accolades or fake plottets.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:58.020]   They just want to go out and build
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:00.820]   and make a big, big, profitable company consistently.
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.940]   So in this case, they were a large corporation
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.140]   and huge valuation.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.260]   They had fake, or at least vanity board members.
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:08.780]   They had changing board commits.
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:10.260]   They didn't show a financial as if I recall
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:11.380]   the book "Bad Blooded Correctly."
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:15.220]   So every possible warning sign there was ringing.
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:16.940]   And still, people were willing to buy into it.
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.620]   But keep in mind, there are the investors,
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:21.460]   I think for the large part, weren't traditional VCs.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:24.180]   It wasn't like this was Sequoia and Kleiner
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.300]   and other firms that we all kind of know by name.
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:27.820]   It was other entities.
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.540]   And to your point of view,
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:30.980]   you found a way to get the money.
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.940]   It doesn't make what you did okay.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:33.980]   - No, no.
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:34.820]   - Frauds fraud.
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.340]   - But I mean, Dwight, you've been covering these companies
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:38.180]   for years now.
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.220]   What are your key warning signs when you think
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:42.940]   we may be looking at another Theranos?
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.780]   - Oh, I think you look at somebody who has come in
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:49.420]   and can't really explain to a lay person
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:52.180]   what exactly it is that they're doing.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:54.420]   - That seems to be pretty much every blockchain startup.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.940]   - Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:57.780]   - Oh, bugger, sorry.
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:02.300]   - I suspect in blockchain, granted,
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:05.900]   there are some people who have legitimate companies there.
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:08.740]   But I know that the Texas Attorney General
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:11.180]   has shut down quite a few of them that aren't.
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.900]   I think you just got to make sure that there is a real product
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.980]   that there's actually something that can be delivered
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:17.060]   and that it really works.
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:19.020]   And you look at who's competing with them
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:22.500]   and what they're doing to see if it's really real.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.780]   - I'm sorry, I'm worried about magic leap on this.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:28.220]   - I once covered a sleep metrics startup
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:30.140]   where the idea was that you'd have your device
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.180]   and slip it in.
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.260]   And I asked the founder,
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.140]   well, what are your qualifications for this?
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:37.220]   I said, are you an actual sleep scientist?
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.860]   Have you done research in the field?
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:42.780]   Why did this product arise out of research?
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:45.180]   She goes, well, no, I'm an undergraduate,
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:47.540]   but I've reviewed the literature extensively.
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:52.260]   And that was when I was like, okay.
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.700]   - That's a very Dr. Nick Hello, everybody.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.540]   - Well, it's also, I want to point out,
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:59.140]   it's also a very startup culture answer where,
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:01.260]   for me, and I don't know if this is the same for you
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:02.500]   or if I'm just really unfair,
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.420]   but for me, one of the warning bells
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:07.100]   is when someone's like, I notice something.
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.260]   This is crazy to me.
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:11.380]   So I educated myself on it and now I have a company.
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:14.060]   And that's bad.
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:16.460]   - Well, those companies usually don't work out well
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.180]   because it may be crazy to them,
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:19.780]   but they're still approaching it from a lay person
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:20.620]   perspective.
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:21.660]   - They don't have an expert's background
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:22.820]   in why that problem exists,
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:23.980]   how hard it will be to go about it.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:24.820]   - Exactly.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:26.140]   - Yeah, I get that.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:28.180]   - Enthusiasm though, is critical to entrepreneurship.
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:29.420]   - Well, enthusiasm is critical,
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.340]   but there's informed enthusiasm versus uninformed enthusiasm.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:34.820]   - It's necessarily but not sufficient.
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:35.660]   - Yeah.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.580]   - Sorry, please.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:38.980]   - I think also we've seen a drastic change
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:41.820]   in the last couple of years about the way
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.460]   some of these companies getting funded.
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.940]   I mean, we're seeing a lot with Kickstarter
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:47.660]   and the other sort of low ways,
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:50.460]   ways of renting relatively low revenues,
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:52.460]   but already the first waves of fraud
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.380]   are coming through there.
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:56.260]   We've had a smart backpack maker already this week
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:59.020]   who's now being hunted down to 700 grand
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.980]   of Kickstarter funds have gone missing.
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:04.660]   I mean, honestly, I kind of like the idea
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:05.660]   of crowdfunding projects.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.180]   I've taken part in a couple of myself.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.700]   I've got no complaints with it whatsoever,
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.660]   but do you think they make this kind of fraud more likely?
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.780]   - Yes, on a small scale,
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.980]   but can I add one thing more to my answer before
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:19.940]   about warning signs and companies?
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:23.300]   The more you claim you're going to imitate Steve Jobs
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.860]   or you do it without telling me,
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.300]   the more I presume you are so full of beans,
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:29.740]   people like to say like, you know, like,
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:30.740]   I'm like, oh, you're being a jerk.
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.020]   They go, oh, jobs was a jerk.
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:33.460]   I'm like, and you're not Steve Jobs.
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:34.900]   You're just a jerk.
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:36.940]   - And she wore the-- - Turtle, the--
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.500]   - The turtleneck. - Yeah, I mean,
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.620]   like this is, you know, time to become.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:44.020]   - Her semiotics were flawless because she, you know,
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:45.260]   again, she did the Steve Jobs thing
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.660]   to imply that she had other things to think about,
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:49.420]   but she still presented as very strongly feminine
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.620]   and that was also a part of the thing was,
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:53.460]   oh, she's bucking convention because she's a lady
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:56.740]   and that was legitimately part of the whole story
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:01.060]   because I guarantee you, if it had been a middle-aged scientist
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:03.700]   who had spent the last 20 years of his life in a lab
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:06.100]   coming out wearing a t-shirt saying this stuff,
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.620]   it wouldn't have gotten the same dress
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:08.700]   or the same benefit at the time.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.340]   - 19-year-old Stanford dropout,
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.740]   fastest self-made billionaire woman in history, et cetera,
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.580]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.940]   - Time to bring real billionaire though.
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.740]   You're not a billionaire until you sell the stock
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.700]   and sit on the Scrooge McDuck's piles of money.
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:22.060]   - Oh, that's not how we do in Silicon Valley.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:23.940]   But I wanted to bring up something that happens
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:25.900]   at the back end of a company like this
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.500]   because I was reading through the coverage
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.540]   of its impending solution
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:31.980]   and there was a phrase that kind of stuck out to me
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.700]   which was the company intends to enter
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:37.580]   into an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:39.900]   Now, assignment benefit creditors, ABC,
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.260]   I didn't know what that means, we're meant.
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.660]   So I talked to a friend of mine who is an entrepreneur
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:47.020]   and what it means is it's when you have to turn over
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:49.500]   every single thing you have, your IP, your cash,
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:52.100]   your equipment, and then someone tries to just get rid
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:54.060]   of all that for so much money as they can.
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:56.380]   So it's really like having your bones sold
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.420]   and it's really an ad- - It's a liquidation.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:28:59.780]   - It's the garage sale.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:01.020]   - It's the garage sale. - It's a liquidation, yeah.
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.340]   - But with a fancier phrase.
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:03.620]   So if you were curious what's happening to them,
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.780]   they're being sold for the last eight bucks they can be.
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:08.460]   - So what I'm hearing is that a lot of errand chairs
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:10.860]   are about to come on the market for just $200 apiece.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.180]   - Well, you laugh but I actually got confirmation from it
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:17.220]   'cause I got a tip that a company called North Security
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.380]   was going out, was going bust
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:22.060]   and we got a couple of their former members coming in
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.420]   and one of them sent me, I don't know if I can say this on air
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:27.820]   but I asked him for proof that he actually worked at North
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:30.780]   and he sent a picture of the Christmas card
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:32.900]   that they'd been sent by the CEO
[01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:36.180]   which he'd disboiled in a biological way.
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:39.860]   But anyway, we found out that they were,
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:42.460]   we were doing a craigslist search down by their offices
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.420]   and there were a ton of curate coughing machines
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:45.620]   coming on the market. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:47.900]   - We did a quick map search, yep, it's their offices.
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:49.860]   They really are selling off the family silver.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:51.940]   - Yeah, no, we work at home but my husband
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.660]   is also a tech journalist, we both work at home
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:57.620]   and we got our errand office chairs for less than $300 apiece
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:59.220]   because we just kept looking at craigslist
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:01.380]   and anytime a startup goes under,
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:03.100]   those chairs go on the market for super cheap.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:04.500]   There's no, if you live in the Bay Area,
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.100]   there's no reason to buy one new.
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.340]   (laughing)
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:10.660]   - That was a storyline in Silicon Valley
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:12.260]   and HBO's Silicon Valley.
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.580]   - Yeah, no, totally legit.
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:16.500]   - Yeah. - Yep, yep, so that's very common there.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.980]   - A lot of that show is a joke
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.260]   but a lot of that show isn't really a joke either
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:22.540]   if you've been around long enough to see cycles.
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:24.620]   - No, we do a lot of cringing and recognition.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:26.180]   - That's why I don't like to show actually.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:27.540]   - It's a funny one, wow.
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.460]   - Yeah, it's a funny one.
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:30.940]   - It's a pretty show called Yes Minister about government
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:34.660]   which is some of the key anecdotes of that actually happen
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.700]   will fed to them by cabinet ministers.
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:38.660]   - Yeah.
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:40.380]   - Just one last quick little bit before we move on.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.180]   One lesson that I was taught about economic cycles
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:46.180]   is that towards the peak or a little bit after the peak
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:48.140]   you'll see a rise in fraud
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.900]   and that can be a warning sign
[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:52.500]   that a sustained bull market or an economic boom
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.020]   may be coming to its end.
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.700]   And I don't wanna be a doomsayer here, that's my day job
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:31:00.100]   but we're like what, eight, 10 years into this bull cycle
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:02.620]   we're seeing a rise in fraud that would tend to go together
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.900]   and so I'm not saying sell your socks
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:04.740]   but I'm also saying keep an eye out.
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:06.620]   - I honestly feel like, I honestly feel like the sign
[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:08.820]   is when the San Francisco Chronicle starts running the package
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.780]   is about how people are leaving California and droves
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.700]   and it's unlivable.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.100]   - I know we live here half time.
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.020]   I'm doing that.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:15.540]   Maybe I have an indicator.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:16.380]   Oh, that's fun.
[01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:17.220]   - Where else are you living?
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.060]   - Providence.
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:19.220]   - Oh, nice.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.860]   Okay, I mean, of course, I mean,
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:22.780]   a lot of stuff that's moving out to Texas,
[01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:24.220]   I mean, largely around the Austin area
[01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:25.860]   but you've got a fair few down there.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:27.420]   - Do you think Silicon Valley is losing its edge
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:28.860]   on this front and you're gonna reap the benefit
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:29.700]   from this too, I?
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:34.460]   - I think Silicon Valley will keep its edge
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:37.220]   'cause it has achieved critical mass.
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:40.460]   Although the economics there make it incredibly difficult.
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.900]   Houston is putting in a big push right now
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:48.340]   to improve its startup worthiness.
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.300]   They have launched an innovation district
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:54.820]   that's going into an old 1930s Sears building
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:57.860]   and they are touting low taxes
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:31:59.580]   and a better quality of life.
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:04.580]   Houston is not any longer the smoggy mosquito town.
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.020]   Well, we still have the mosquitoes
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.420]   but there's less smog.
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:09.140]   - And the under- - The Anderson humidity
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:09.980]   and the-
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:10.820]   - Yeah, so we still have that
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:12.860]   but our air conditioning is top notch
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.660]   and air conditioning is everywhere
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.540]   unlike in San Francisco.
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:18.740]   So anyway, it's, a lot of people
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:20.060]   I think are looking at what's happening.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:25.060]   I remember when Carly Fiorina became CEO of HP
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:28.580]   and she was talking about because
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:31.580]   of the inexpensive price of land
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:32.780]   that doing business in Texas
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:35.540]   that she was gonna move more of HP's operation
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:38.500]   to the Houston campus that they had acquired from Compaq.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.780]   That never happened.
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:41.460]   I think that tells you something.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.300]   - Yeah.
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:43.220]   I grew up in an HP town.
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:44.380]   This is one of the few little things
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:45.980]   that my town of Corbelle's Oregon had in his name.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:47.460]   It's a huge HP facility
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:51.620]   and I grew up in the Korean post-Carly era.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.820]   And so I kind of saw the declines you're discussing
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:56.140]   in real time as my friends, parents got fired.
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:56.980]   - Yeah.
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:58.140]   - I went to graduate school in upstate New York
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:00.260]   right after IBM did a massive round of layoffs
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:03.740]   in the early 90s and watching the economic ripple effects
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.140]   through upstate was kind of terrifying.
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:06.980]   - Yeah, I mean, I've got to say
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:10.340]   I covered the original sort of,
[01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:11.660]   when Fira in the first came in,
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:14.900]   I was kind of like, well, she's not a business inside.
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.180]   Let's go and see her speak.
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.180]   She's a brilliant public speaker.
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:19.900]   You know, I mean, I was at a sales conference
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.220]   of theirs in Holland.
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:23.260]   All the HP people were just like, wow, you know,
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:24.740]   we've actually got something here.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.060]   And then the cuts started and the mismanagement
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.100]   and that I'm still unsure about whether the Compaq
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.140]   merger actually helped them in the long run.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.060]   - I would've did that.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:33.900]   - No.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.740]   - It did that.
[01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.300]   - That's three, three nodes in it maybe.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:38.500]   So the panel's not giving you exactly the thumbs up.
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.580]   (laughing)
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.340]   - What if we take two dying companies
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.940]   in the PC business and put them together?
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.020]   Will the car go faster?
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.420]   Oh, no, it's crashed.
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:47.300]   - It's like the worst type of symbiont.
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:49.820]   - I know, and they just say they took the smart people
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.620]   and spun them off into the research
[01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:53.820]   and the research and development arms.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:56.700]   And then, yeah, it just, and then Kylie
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.380]   feed her around for office and she's like,
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:01.420]   I'm a job creator and I love the HP
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:02.500]   for me to be exact.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.860]   So it was just like, no.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:04.700]   - No, you win.
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:06.340]   (laughing)
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.900]   - My job's in India right now.
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.580]   Thanks, Kylie.
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.500]   - I do actually wonder if politics is going to get more
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:15.260]   difficult as social media does give you
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:18.700]   more opportunities for on the fly fact checking.
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:19.540]   - I think so.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.140]   I mean, I think also there's also--
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:22.660]   - I mean, there's the potential for misinformation,
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:25.260]   but when you think about it, she made those claims
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:27.020]   and think about how quickly they were refuted
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.060]   and that was picked up and not part of the story.
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:30.180]   - And on video as well, they got a decent
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:31.020]   quasi-video this time.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:32.460]   - Yeah, and think about how quickly that was,
[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:34.900]   and then try to imagine something like that happening
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:37.660]   during the Clinton administration in the 1990s
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:38.980]   where you could have had a bunch of IBM
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.340]   or sang the same thing and it would have taken
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:45.220]   weeks to months to break past a local news cycle.
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:48.380]   - Yeah, no, there are dangers in that as well though.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:49.820]   - Yeah, exactly, it's misinformation
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:50.660]   because of the propaganda.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:51.660]   - The rush to judgment as well.
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:54.220]   I mean, we saw this with the Boston bombings and Reddit.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:56.980]   - Oh, well, that's a good call out of essentially
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.820]   crowd-sourced fake news, honestly.
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:34:59.660]   - Right.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:00.500]   - Yeah.
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:02.220]   - That was not Reddit's best moment.
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:04.700]   - New and it's not had some not great moment.
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:05.980]   - It's up with the pantheon of bad,
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:08.580]   but it's quite an extensive collection there at the top.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:10.700]   - Yeah, we shall have to see.
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:12.980]   - Okay, let's get another word in from our sponsors
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:14.700]   that make this marvelous podcast possible.
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:15.900]   Take it away, Leo.
[01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:19.140]   - Ian, if I could pause you for a bit
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:22.220]   and tell about, I need to be here for this one.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:25.580]   Our sponsor was Sabi.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.860]   And the reason is I've known these guys for years,
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:32.780]   are good friends, Jeff Flowers and David Friend.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.140]   I know them from carbonite, right?
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.100]   They created carbonite.
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:37.460]   David I've known for years.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:40.140]   He was a guy who created the ARPS synthesizer way back
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:43.820]   when he's a really interesting serial entrepreneur.
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:48.420]   And it turned out, when Jeff and David were doing carbonite,
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.820]   they got many patents.
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:51.620]   They learned a lot about hard drives work
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:54.340]   and they got many patents, particularly on the way
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:57.060]   to write to hard drives very efficiently.
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:36:03.020]   Directly the metal without the operating system in the way.
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:06.860]   And when David kind of left, he didn't leave,
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:09.580]   but he retired from day-to-day operations at carbonite,
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:13.340]   he and Jeff said, you know, we know so much about hard drives.
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:15.060]   We really ought to do something
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.980]   when it comes to hot cloud storage.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.780]   So they founded, 'cause it's hot cloud storage, right?
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:22.140]   That means it's active.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:23.460]   They call it was Sabi.
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:25.260]   (laughs)
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:27.220]   Was Sabi hot cloud storage.
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:29.220]   Data storage is a big deal.
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:31.420]   I mean, for media companies like us, obviously,
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:36.180]   motion picture industry, film, animation,
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:38.740]   but everybody, every business now is generating
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:40.540]   huge amounts of data.
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:45.620]   In fact, the estimate is 163 zettabytes of data
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:47.820]   for business by 2025.
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:53.100]   The 163 plus 21 zeros. (laughs)
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:56.020]   That's a lot of data.
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:59.900]   So there is a very important financial calculation
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.260]   that every business has to make about
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:02.180]   where they store their data.
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:07.180]   It needs to be reliable, safe, fast, efficient,
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:12.620]   and it also has to be affordable, 'cause yeah,
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:14.260]   well, you can get all the first four
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:15.900]   if you don't mind spending a million bucks,
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:17.980]   but really, this is a business.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:19.620]   We gotta do this economically.
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.900]   And that's why was Sabi is here.
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:25.220]   They can efficiently and affordably store your data
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:27.140]   in the cloud.
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:29.580]   It's disruptive technology that's turning the industry
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:30.660]   on its ear.
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:33.660]   They're brand new and I know no one knows the name
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.700]   and that's why I wanted to come here and tell you,
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:38.020]   'cause I do know David and Jeff,
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.140]   I have huge respect for them.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:41.980]   And I think what they're doing with Sabi
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:43.060]   is something you need to know.
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:45.540]   If you're tasked with figuring out
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.180]   what are you gonna use as an Amazon,
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.820]   Microsoft, is a Google,
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:51.340]   I want you to add one more name to that list, please.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:54.660]   That's all I ask with Sabi Hot Cloud Storage.
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:59.660]   80% cheaper, six times the speed of the industry leader
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:02.500]   you know that is.
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.860]   Let me say that again, that's important.
[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:06.780]   It's not only 80% cheaper, it's six times faster.
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.900]   And it's simple.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:11.220]   There's just one tier of service.
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:14.980]   There's no charge for egress, free unlimited egress.
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.340]   By the way, that's a big cost
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:19.860]   that you really can't plan for in other services.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.700]   How do you budget?
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:22.260]   You don't know how much data you're gonna need
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:23.820]   to suck from that server.
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:25.540]   It's free at Wasabi.
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:28.900]   Wasabi is HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant,
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:30.620]   CJIS compliant.
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:32.580]   So no matter what your business,
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:35.380]   this is safe, secure storage.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:38.060]   And they have this thing called the Wasabi Ball.
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:40.260]   Go, gotta look at the website.
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:43.900]   That it's for migrating data as much petabytes of data
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.420]   simply quickly and securely.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:49.300]   And if you are looking for a Cloud Storage provider,
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:51.740]   a Hot Cloud Storage provider,
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:54.740]   you've got to add Wasabi to your list.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:57.140]   In fact, you could try it with free unlimited storage
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:57.980]   for a month right now.
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:01.660]   If you go to wasabi.com, W-A-S-A-B-I.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:05.180]   Yes, like the horse radish, W-A-S-A-B-I.com.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.300]   Click the free trial link
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:08.020]   and in order to get the unlimited,
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.660]   you have to use the offer code TWIT.
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:12.660]   You gotta add this to investigate.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:16.780]   80% cheaper, six time the speed
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:19.660]   and absolutely reliable.
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:20.820]   I think more than anybody else.
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.020]   Wasabi.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:28.020]   Thank you, Jeff and David for believing in me
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:29.540]   'cause I believe in you.
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.500]   And I think everybody who's listening should consider it
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:34.500]   wasabi.com offer code TWIT.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.180]   Now back to Thompson and company.
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.900]   Thompson and company, I like the sound of that.
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:40.620]   Thank you very much, Leo.
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:41.720]   Right, okay.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:46.180]   We've had a, it's been an anniversary week as well
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:49.940]   because Chrome has turned 10 hard to believe that,
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.540]   you know, when Chrome came out,
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:52.740]   in says Explorer had what was it,
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.180]   95% of the browser market.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.020]   And now it's--
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:56.860]   It's incredibly high.
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:58.700]   Chrome has the most and an edge,
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.220]   i.e. and also Safari,
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:01.140]   and there's some other ones in there.
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:03.460]   But it's in our world, 100%.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:07.820]   Yeah, and then Google is round about 20 years old.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:08.660]   It's difficult to believe,
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:13.220]   I think it was 99 I heard that
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.700]   Larry and Sergey had been talking to venture capitalists
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:16.740]   just to try and get enough money
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:18.500]   to get this idea off the ground.
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.540]   And they were looking to sell,
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:22.500]   I think 10% of the company for a million.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:23.500]   Which is--
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.660]   Which is, Alex, crunch the numbers for us.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.500]   Yeah, so--
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:27.340]   He's a crunch face after all.
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:28.580]   How much would 10,
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:31.380]   would a million dollar investment in Google got made?
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:33.380]   So currently, today,
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:35.980]   10% of Google per Google Finance
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:39.700]   would be $81.5 billion.
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.420]   Which is a pretty good return on million dollars
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:42.060]   over 20 years.
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.700]   That compounds out quite nicely.
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:46.540]   And that's actually down a bit from its highs.
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:49.420]   So good job to everyone putting money into Google.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:50.340]   You're a genius.
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:51.180]   It is one of the problems--
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.020]   Unless you sold, and then you're taking a look
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:53.860]   at the calculator,
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:55.500]   I left as much money on the table myself.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:56.340]   I like it this time.
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:57.340]   That's everyone who sold their Bitcoin
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:58.940]   for December 2017, I feel.
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:01.740]   Yeah, I mean, but we've seen this before, do I?
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:03.420]   I mean, one of the original investors in Apple
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:04.700]   sold out his stake for what was it?
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:05.820]   Two grand or something for a--
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:06.820]   Oh, oh.
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:07.700]   That's right.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:09.100]   And then, still, Insisty's not bitter,
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.100]   which shows--
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:10.940]   I would be bitter.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.940]   It's remarkably evolved.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.660]   Microsoft raised money from VCs
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:15.460]   before they went public just to get the pedigree.
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:17.500]   And Gates said that money just sat in the bank.
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:18.340]   We never used it.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:19.860]   It was the most expensive VC round of all time.
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:22.060]   It was a joke, but like, they did that.
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:24.620]   But Google raised 100K,
[01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:25.940]   and then they raised $1 million,
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:28.500]   then $25 million, and then Tim Mill from Yahoo.
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:30.060]   And that was it.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:31.340]   Amazingly profitable company.
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:32.500]   That's what's impressive about Google.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:35.340]   They built so much with so little external capital.
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:37.820]   I can't remember looking at the search interface
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:41.380]   the first time, and when you contrasted it with Altavista,
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:45.740]   and it was so simple and so clean by contrast,
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:50.940]   so that real clarity, it felt like a real clarity of purpose.
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:51.780]   But you're like, oh, I just--
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:52.540]   The results were that good.
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:54.580]   I mean, it was just, you know,
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.300]   compared to the other mainstream browsers,
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:57.580]   I mean, do I have you with that for this?
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:59.580]   I mean, what won you over on Google?
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:02.500]   I agree. It was the cleanness.
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:03.460]   It was the speed.
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:05.260]   It was how accurate it was.
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:10.340]   I had done a big profile on Altavista when Compaq acquired it.
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:12.860]   And I went out there and kind of talked to them
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:15.740]   and actually looked at the servers that were Altavista,
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:18.540]   which were all in like one building at the time.
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:21.700]   And thinking, you know, this is the pinnacle of the internet.
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:24.180]   It can't do-- can't get much better than this.
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:28.460]   And just shortly after that, we got Google.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:32.060]   And I think that it was that the simplicity of it
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:35.900]   is ultimately what drove it along with the quality of the results.
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.260]   And I look at kind of the redesign of Chrome,
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:41.140]   and it seems like they've tried to go back to that,
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:43.780]   although there was one feature that they removed
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:47.980]   in the redesign of Chrome, the tiles that showed you
[01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:52.660]   your most recent-- but most visited sites.
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:57.420]   They reduced them to little tiny icons with the name under it.
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:59.460]   And I hate that.
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:04.020]   And I found a way inside in the Chrome flag setting
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:05.140]   where you cannot do it.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.100]   And now I've got my beloved tiles back.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.180]   I wrote something about that.
[01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:13.420]   But it is-- I kind of like the fact
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:16.220]   that they have gone back to a simpler, cleaner look.
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:19.380]   It says a lot, I think, in their 20th anniversary.
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:19.660]   Yeah.
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:21.220]   I mean, I don't like the new scroll bar.
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.500]   They've gone the side as well, which
[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:23.980]   you've actually got to hover over to pop out.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:26.340]   But it is worth remembering.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.780]   It's a much a max thing, isn't it?
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:30.420]   Isn't that what the way in back OS?
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:31.620]   And I love it there, too.
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:34.180]   I don't use Mac, I'm afraid.
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.020]   I can hate it across multiple vendors.
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.620]   My capacity to be irritated by it is infinite.
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:41.300]   In terms of what Chrome has done, obviously,
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:45.020]   it was Mozilla initially took on the Microsoft monopoly.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:46.540]   Then Mozilla started to fall away,
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:48.660]   and Chrome has taken things back.
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.260]   But I'm now seeing--
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:53.300]   I think there's a definite shift in months of pro users
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.340]   that I'm talking to who are now getting
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:57.860]   so sick of Chrome's memory hog.
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:59.820]   OK, yeah, we have it, yeah.
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:00.820]   Yeah, OK.
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:01.380]   This is my thing.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:03.380]   And now people are going back to Firefox,
[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:05.060]   because it's better on privacy.
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:06.460]   It's better on memory.
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:08.980]   And it's getting there in terms of features.
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:12.140]   Now, honestly, you obviously have a bone to grind.
[01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:14.300]   Well, here's a question for everyone here.
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.300]   Are you guys good at tab management?
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:17.660]   Nice thing to do.
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:17.940]   You are.
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:19.180]   You're economical with your tabs.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:21.500]   Well, actually, perhaps not economical,
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.660]   but what I tend to do is have a couple browser windows open,
[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:25.180]   and then I cluster tabs by function.
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:26.180]   So what window--
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:27.620]   We still have a bunch of tabs open.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:28.580]   Like at least 12.
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:29.580]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:31.900]   I try to close them when I'm done with them.
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.180]   So because I have--
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:35.620]   when working in our content management system,
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:37.460]   if you don't, you get lost really quick.
[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:38.140]   Right.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:40.140]   But I mean, I don't think anyone of us here
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.860]   has two tabs open at any given time.
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:44.220]   Which means we're using a lot of Chrome at once.
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:46.060]   And what I have found across devices,
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:48.140]   I run a gaming PC at home, and then
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:50.260]   I have max for work, whatever.
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:52.220]   Chrome is an enormous memory hug.
[01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:54.940]   And what was once, as Dwight said about early Google search,
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:58.380]   crisp, clean, fast, and better, has become, in Chrome's case,
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:00.340]   convoluted, awful, and iTunes-esque.
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:02.780]   And it makes me want to cry, because when Chrome came out,
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:05.340]   it was literally built to go against that.
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.220]   We are fast.
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:07.140]   We are easy.
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:08.700]   You can't ruin it.
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:10.700]   It was like the iPad of browsers.
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:11.620]   And nowadays, the--
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:13.260]   And I think the problem is that a browser is basically
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:15.220]   a second operating system from most all of us.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:17.540]   Because all of your apps are in your browser.
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:18.820]   They're only browser accessible.
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:19.660]   So--
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:20.900]   That was a good idea.
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:22.540]   And it's a funny because it's portable.
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:24.060]   You can move from machine to machine.
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:24.580]   That's true.
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:28.900]   It lets you have a computing environment that's
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:30.900]   dependent on you and the collection of data
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:33.060]   that's associated with you, rather than a specific machine.
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:33.860]   That's a very valid point.
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:34.700]   I recant my point.
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:35.900]   So that's a good--
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:37.620]   But at the same time, if the browser's
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:40.580]   going to be your primary work interface, it should be better.
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:41.100]   OK.
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.540]   Maybe that's what I was aiming for.
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:44.100]   So if you're going to put everything in the browser,
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:44.940]   can you at least do a good job?
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:47.060]   I have a Windows 10 gaming PC at the house.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:47.820]   It glows red.
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:48.260]   It's great.
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:49.420]   I love it.
[01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:53.140]   And if I run like four to six Google tabs on it, Chrome tabs,
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:55.740]   I can run through two gigs of memory
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:58.300]   if they're just like Politico tabs, like just websites.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:02.660]   What happened to make that even close to OK for the developers
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:04.900]   who made political.com or any other website?
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.820]   And also for how poorly managed it is by Chrome itself.
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:08.780]   That's insane.
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:09.180]   There was a--
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:10.540]   And I think they just don't cry about us Windows PC.
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:11.980]   There was a piece recently on regretting.
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:13.380]   I can't remember exactly the source.
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:15.660]   But someone was saying that one of the side effects of GDPR
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:19.660]   has been that websites have had to drastically redesign,
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:20.340]   to comply.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.380]   And as a result, they've had to start stripping out
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:24.420]   a lot of the crap, Politico's type crap,
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:25.660]   that's on the page already.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:26.180]   Good.
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:27.980]   And so a lot of websites, especially
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:30.300]   non-American websites, have become faster and cleaner
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:33.020]   and more friendly, more high performance
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:34.780]   because they've had to strip out the crap.
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:35.620]   Well, you're also--
[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:40.460]   Well, also Google is penalizing you now if your site is
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:41.940]   loaded and bloated.
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:48.260]   And they will reduce your visibility and search results.
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:50.260]   One of the funny ironies about this
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:54.180]   is that when Chrome appeared, and as Alex said,
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:58.820]   it came out as the lean mean system that was kind of memory,
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:01.140]   the memory hog at the time was Firefox.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:02.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.540]   It's constantly complaining about Firefox.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:05.460]   Oh, it's a joke.
[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:07.100]   Look, that's right.
[01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:07.700]   And now--
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:10.540]   And it'll give hung up on different Java scripts too.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.040]   Yes.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.660]   Now it's reversed.
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:16.340]   And Firefox is actually pretty good in terms of memory.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:17.340]   Yeah.
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:18.500]   Well, at least it's better.
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:21.420]   I have some distinctly 1990s type experiences these days,
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:24.820]   though, where they're in browser apps that only work on Chrome
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:25.820]   and not on Firefox.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:28.460]   And it reminds me of the browser wars when, oh,
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:29.820]   this site is best viewed in that scape,
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:32.020]   or this site is best viewed in an internet explorer.
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:34.540]   And you're like, why can you not build something that works
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:35.140]   across every browser?
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.940]   Well, no, I have a tale to tell about that.
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:39.560]   Back in the mid '90s, when I was a struggling journalist
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.820]   and they just shut the magazine I was working on,
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:44.900]   I succumbed to the sirens call of public relations.
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:47.220]   And I did public relations for a couple of years,
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:49.940]   including working on the Microsoft internet
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:51.820]   explorer team.
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:54.540]   And we were supposed to sign non-disclosure agreements.
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.140]   And I lousy with paperwork and somehow I never actually
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:00.860]   got around to sign the NDA.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:03.900]   So when IE3 came out, they launched a major campaign
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:04.740]   against Netscape.
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:05.940]   They wanted--
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:08.460]   I mean, I was assigned to every screenshot
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:10.080]   for a program.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.720]   We had to redo in IE3 and send them out to magazine
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.720]   and say, hi, if you need it to screenshot this here,
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:17.080]   this is the one on IE3.
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.920]   I had a senior product manager at Microsoft
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.520]   said that the whole point of this campaign
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.000]   was to F something Netscape until they bled.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.320]   And they went all out for it.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.880]   Chrome didn't seem to need to do that.
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:31.920]   They just sort of took people in because--
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.720]   or people went to it because it was lean,
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.880]   because it was better fast.
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.640]   But also look at where Chrome came from too,
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.300]   because it already had that reputational stuff with Google,
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:42.340]   where the idea was Google had already
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.700]   excelled at a search engine.
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:46.820]   People already really liked the other apps it was putting out.
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:50.900]   So why wouldn't you extend the same brand benefit of the doubt?
[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:52.940]   And with IE3, especially--
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.940]   which by the way, I was on the testing team for that,
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:56.940]   because I worked for a website.
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:58.260]   I worked for a media website at the time.
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:00.780]   And I was on the dev side instead of the journalism side.
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:03.460]   And Microsoft flew the devs up every week
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:05.780]   and had us break different iterations of Internet Explorer
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:09.700]   3 with different website designs until so that they could debug it.
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:11.180]   So not a small world.
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:12.500]   But the weird thing about this is,
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.740]   back to the reputation point, now Apple is Samsung,
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:18.060]   and Alphabet is like old Microsoft,
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:19.900]   and Microsoft's kind of cool all of a sudden.
[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:22.220]   So is this mean that Edge is going to come back next?
[01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:23.020]   Because I've used Edge.
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:23.740]   I didn't really like it.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:25.340]   I was going to say that might be pushing it.
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:28.260]   Yeah, I don't think it's going to work this next time around.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:30.260]   But I did use some Firefox, but Dwight,
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:33.740]   I found that it's still used reasonable amounts of more RAM
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:35.500]   than I thought it was reasonable to load text
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:36.540]   and display it on my screens.
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:39.340]   I wasn't even that happy with current Firefox performance.
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:42.220]   I don't know if everyone just presumes you have 16 gigs of RAM,
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:43.860]   but I mean, I have eight.
[01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:44.220]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:47.940]   And that should be enough to run Chrome without lagging
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:49.140]   or Firefox without lagging.
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:50.060]   I don't have to say that much.
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:52.140]   You know, somewhere there's like a Safari product manager
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:54.180]   who's just quietly crying that we haven't even mentioned that
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:55.340]   browser.
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:56.860]   OK, well, I mean, let's see.
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:58.300]   When's the last time you used Safari?
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:49:58.700]   I was going to say.
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:49:59.540]   I used it on my iPad.
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:49:59.900]   That's it.
[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:00.940]   OK, so it's an iPad.
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:02.780]   Dwight, Safari, ever?
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:05.900]   I use it on because I need to check our website.
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.060]   I use it that daily to check the website,
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:09.540]   but mostly I use Chrome.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:11.900]   And I use Safari on the iPad and the iPhone.
[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:12.940]   Yeah, I use it on my iPhone.
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.580]   Oh, maybe I should Safari does have pretty good market
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:15.260]   here among us things.
[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:15.820]   We all have--
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:16.340]   I don't know.
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:16.500]   We use it.
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:17.580]   But notice how we use it more.
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:18.820]   But it does not press.
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.340]   Oh, you're also-- you're that kidding class.
[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:22.100]   So 75% more than 75% more than that.
[01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:24.060]   Well, the one who cares about owning some--
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:25.460]   No, no, I apologize.
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:26.980]   What do you use?
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.820]   I use a Chromebook for mucking about
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.420]   and I use a Windows machine for work.
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:31.660]   I mean, if you're a phone.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:32.900]   Oh, it's my phone, Android.
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:33.860]   But which one?
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:34.460]   Pixel.
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:35.140]   Oh, OK, cool.
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:35.980]   And do you like that?
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:37.260]   I think it's great.
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:40.620]   The key thing I went with Pixel is because we get security
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:41.820]   updates first.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:43.580]   Oh, just the Google products you get the--
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:44.100]   Yeah.
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:46.380]   So you get the security updates as soon as they come out.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:48.340]   Whereas if you go with Nokia or Huawei or whatever,
[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:51.460]   then your dependencies might come down six months down
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:51.460]   the line.
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:53.100]   So Pixel 3?
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:55.300]   I'm actually still using a Pixel 1
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:59.020]   because there's a Pixel 3 event coming up next month.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.500]   Yeah, that's what I'm excited about.
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:03.060]   Yeah, which I think I should be invited to.
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:05.380]   We weren't too nasty about them last time.
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:07.140]   And--
[01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:09.980]   If you're watching the show, here's a--
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:10.980]   Here's a new phone.
[01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:14.180]   But no, I mean, I had a Pixel 1 and I--
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:16.940]   first time ever I owned a phone, not bothered
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:17.740]   to put a cover on it.
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:19.940]   And of course, I smashed the screen to hell and back.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:20.940]   I mean, people are--
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:23.340]   I mean, I've got bangs on both sides of this one right now.
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:24.620]   And I shot the one before I do.
[01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:26.220]   I got to buy a case, but I'm just too lazy.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:26.740]   I know.
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:27.940]   But you're also buying a new phone.
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:29.620]   So why are you about buying the case?
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:31.460]   Yeah, because this is all I should spend my 401K money.
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:33.260]   But you see, this is a good--
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:33.620]   Oh, we're tired.
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.620]   Google is in a way almost trying to steal Apple's shoes
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:36.980]   in this as well, because there's a show.
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:38.620]   The Pixel 3 event is coming up.
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:41.740]   They're going to release another very expensive laptop,
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:44.780]   which, let's face it, without internet connection,
[01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:48.100]   is still pretty much an expensive brick.
[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:49.940]   But they are gaining--
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:52.780]   I like it because it's secure and because it's
[01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:53.660]   relatively fast.
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:57.100]   But Google is an operating system and a laptop vendor.
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:58.780]   What do you think of that?
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:01.860]   It's a big connectivity and take it to sell it at a loss
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:03.100]   and get a bajillion customers.
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:06.300]   If you sold a laptop that came with constant internet
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:07.780]   connectivity to a certain point, I
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.340]   would buy it just for the sake of convenience.
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:10.820]   So that'll get me on Chrome OS tomorrow.
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:12.820]   And I'll pay for my own money.
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:16.700]   Google is taking on the old Apple II model
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:18.740]   where they're getting it into schools.
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:19.820]   See, yeah.
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:23.020]   And so you get younger people using it as they come up.
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:24.660]   That's what they want to use.
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:28.300]   And so as they get older, by their own laptops,
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:30.260]   they look at Chromebooks.
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:32.980]   And I think that that's a brilliant strategy.
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:37.380]   And just remember, Apple last year had its education event
[01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:40.580]   that had this little thing and then nothing ever
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:41.980]   came of it afterwards.
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:43.620]   Apple would like to get some of that back.
[01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:45.340]   But I just don't think they know how.
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:47.660]   So on a purely anecdotal level, I
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.620]   do have a daughter who's in elementary school.
[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:51.060]   And I've also got nieces and nephews
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:52.620]   who are in high school and college.
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:56.060]   And our island school system is all Google Chromebooks.
[01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:58.340]   And what's been interesting about that
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.460]   is watching these kids work collaboratively
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:03.300]   in the Google Apps once they get old enough to.
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:04.940]   My nephews and my niece, all of whom
[01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:07.380]   now do things like essays and research projects,
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:12.980]   have no conception of working without sharing documents
[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:15.780]   or without seeing changes in edits made in real time.
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:17.420]   And when they ask them to review something,
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:19.580]   they just shoot you a link and suck you
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.860]   into the Google app ecosystem that way too.
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:23.540]   And it's also quite a political thing.
[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:25.100]   If she throws someone off the Google Doc,
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:25.940]   then they just like--
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:29.900]   But what's interesting about that is there was--
[01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:32.420]   I want to say it's Nielsen up in Portland recently
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:34.260]   announced that they were switching their office
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:37.980]   from the Microsoft suite of applications over to Google Apps
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:40.420]   because their younger workforce was like,
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:44.300]   why would I use Microsoft's Office suite when I'm already
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:46.580]   fluent and conversant in using Google's?
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:48.460]   And I'm comfortable working in that.
[01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:50.500]   And these kids come into the kids.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:51.260]   They're in their 20s.
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:52.020]   They come into--
[01:53:52.020 --> 01:53:52.520]   Hey.
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:53.020]   Hey.
[01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:54.020]   Hey.
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:55.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:57.860]   But they come into the office with workflows already in place
[01:53:57.860 --> 01:53:59.620]   and ideas on how to do this.
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:01.580]   And Google is-- and by winning education
[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:05.580]   and by changing the way people regard their intellectual
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.620]   property and collaboration, they're
[01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:09.460]   winning the workplace too.
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:12.540]   In another 10 to 15 years, I think you're going to see--
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:14.420]   I mean, this is one of the reasons I think Microsoft is now
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:19.620]   doubling down on its emphasis on digital transformation,
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:22.780]   its use of machine learning and time management
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:25.060]   and all of its office apps is they're trying to claw back
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:28.420]   some of that mind share from people who have already
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:31.600]   10 years of investment in the Google experience
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:32.820]   from elementary school and up.
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:33.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.340]   I think that the fact they didn't build a lightweight version
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:36.700]   of Word much earlier on.
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:39.860]   Just Word.com and just make a Google Apps with a Microsoft
[01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:41.980]   sticker on top was a mistake because they had the mind share
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:44.780]   back then to drive adoption when Google Apps didn't.
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:47.700]   And now, Google Apps is the Devacto standard at least
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:48.500]   every startup.
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:49.660]   And if it's like every school too,
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:52.780]   that means all the new stuff's coming up in Judox.
[01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:55.460]   But I watched the elementary kids in my daughter's school
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:58.460]   because my daughter's seven and I watched those kids.
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:01.580]   And they already regard the Google environment
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:04.460]   as their default environment.
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:08.300]   They might play Minecraft, but as far as they're concerned,
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:10.860]   school is done on their Chromebooks.
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:11.940]   And they're very excited.
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:14.220]   And they love the experience of having it
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:16.980]   and being able to touch on it and all of that.
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:19.300]   And I think that if you cover tech,
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:21.740]   you pay attention to how those educational experiences
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:24.900]   are shaping computer users because they're the ones
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:26.740]   who are going to be affecting enterprise spending
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:28.740]   in another five to 15 years.
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:29.660]   Well, this is-- I mean, Dwight,
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:31.820]   you rose a very good point in the Apple's--
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:34.660]   in the '80s and '90s, Apple was excellent at getting
[01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:36.300]   their kit into schools.
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:36.940]   But nowadays, Apple--
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:39.780]   I am my entire career to Apple colonizing schools
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:40.780]   in the 1980s.
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:42.140]   But could they do that again?
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:45.300]   Because, you know, Apple is now much, much too focused
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:47.460]   on the high-end, high-cost thing.
[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:49.820]   And Google seems to think, right, we'll have some of that market.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.460]   And they've still slid in there.
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:54.140]   I mean, Dwight, do you think Apple can put it back?
[01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:58.060]   Schools are too cheap to want to buy Apple products
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:01.500]   at the scale that Apple wants to sell it to them.
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:04.020]   They might be able to sell low-end iPads.
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:06.660]   But kids probably need a little bit more than that.
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:08.540]   They need to have more computer skills
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:10.700]   than just knowing how to use an iPad.
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:15.260]   I think the Chromebook Pixel is an excellent--
[01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:16.060]   idea.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:19.420]   So long as when they take it home,
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:21.380]   their parents have internet access as well.
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:25.620]   A lot of low-income folks who don't actually have even
[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:28.660]   home broadband, they rely on it on their phones.
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:32.940]   And so there's a large number of folks
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:34.820]   who that just doesn't fit.
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:35.340]   Yeah.
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.700]   That might be Google's opportunity
[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.540]   to build out their mobile universe that way then.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:40.900]   Because if they can sell you a phone package
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:46.220]   with a discount internet connectivity bundle.
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:47.660]   I think it's going to be a great leveler.
[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:50.260]   I mean, so when I moved to SF six, seven years ago,
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.980]   I had a dinner with a bunch of Ford people.
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:53.620]   This was back before Tesla kind of blew up.
[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:54.660]   I mean, they came to the thing.
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:56.140]   They're like, what do you think we should do with Ford?
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:58.140]   I'm like, build an internet to all your cars
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:56:58.660]   and make it free.
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:56:59.820]   They're like, oh, we can't do that.
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:01.260]   It's expensive.
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:03.540]   And I feel like that argument was correct then.
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:04.700]   It's correct now for PCs, too.
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:08.700]   I think hand connectivity will be a market changer in a way
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:10.780]   to build market share where companies have--
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:11.340]   Lost it.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.580]   Well, you know what's kind of fun?
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:14.380]   It may come from 5G.
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:14.580]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:16.900]   Because I think the ubiquity of it,
[01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:19.460]   once it really catches hold, will enable that.
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:21.300]   I've got a nasty feeling that the 5G rollout
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:22.700]   is going to be completely botched.
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:23.700]   I mean, I--
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:26.540]   I hope Dwight's right, but I think you're right.
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.260]   Well, I mean, when you look at the amount of trouble
[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:31.820]   we have with 4G, where people were just saying stuff was 4G,
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:35.140]   which plainly wasn't, you know, remember Ymax.
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:35.700]   But we're in--
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:36.060]   We're in--
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:36.220]   We're in--
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:36.220]   We're in--
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:37.220]   We're in--
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:40.740]   We're in that phase now with AT&T's 5G.
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:42.740]   We're in that phase now with 5G evolution.
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:46.300]   But I think they learned a lot from that at the time.
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:50.300]   And I think when 5G comes, it'll come for real.
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:52.900]   And Verizon is going to launch here.
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:55.420]   Houston is one of the cities where it's going to happen.
[01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.860]   Fixed broadband 5G.
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:58:02.660]   And I think the folks here with Comcast and AT&T
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:05.220]   are a little bit nervous about that from their home
[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:10.660]   broadband, because if 5G works as advertised,
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:14.100]   it could be a game changer in terms of home broadband.
[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:18.180]   And if they don't put such heavy data caps on it,
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:21.740]   then it becomes useless as a home broadband product.
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:23.580]   Yeah, well, we'll say, when you have to have
[01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:26.220]   AFE in the sentence twice, then you know that it's--
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:27.980]   It's not a done deal yet.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:29.740]   OK, but to argue against that, though, back
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:31.460]   when we were talking about how Altovista had some servers
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:32.980]   in a room, and we thought that was the best internet
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:35.980]   that was ever going to get, we feel that way about wireless
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:36.860]   internet today, right?
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:38.900]   So the economic force is behind this.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:41.660]   The profit available, I think, will drive it forward.
[01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:44.860]   And so by the time my kids are in college, it'll be good.
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:45.940]   In the meantime, we'll suffer.
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:47.340]   But I think eventually we get this right.
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:48.580]   And eventually it's amazing.
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:52.980]   Yeah, it took about five to six years for LTE
[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:58.340]   to get it right, to get where LTE was ubiquitous and comfortable.
[01:58:58.340 --> 01:59:01.620]   It still isn't 100% reliable, but it certainly
[01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:03.100]   is better than it was at the beginning.
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:05.980]   And I think you're looking at probably five to six years
[01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:08.860]   again for 5G to hit that same point.
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:11.180]   I wish you'll have to say, right.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:12.860]   No, when Doug's-- excuse me, when
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.020]   Dwight's here doing his 300th show,
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:19.260]   we'll be able to check back in and check on that prediction.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:21.460]   I remember back in the day when 2.5G was the last week.
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:22.420]   He's promised us.
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:24.500]   Please promise us that you'll reassemble us all
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:25.980]   so we can talk about that prediction.
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:27.940]   I would love to see how it turns out.
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:29.220]   100 more shows in Port Dwayne.
[01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:30.300]   I mean, that's a lot of Twit.
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:32.500]   No, I said 250 more shows.
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:33.900]   I was trying to cut that down because I don't
[01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.380]   want you to kill him.
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:36.340]   I have faith in him.
[01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:37.580]   I don't know where you are on that.
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:38.260]   OK.
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:39.860]   I have no comment.
[01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:41.300]   OK, right.
[01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:43.380]   Now, before we go, here's a quick view
[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:45.460]   about a new show that's coming on Twit tomorrow
[01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:47.380]   and its Valley of the Geniuses.
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:49.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:52.540]   Hi, everybody.
[01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:55.420]   I want to introduce a brand new podcast in the Twit Network.
[01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:57.020]   We don't do new podcasts very often,
[01:59:57.020 --> 02:00:01.540]   and we haven't done an audio-only podcast in a long, long time.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:03.660]   A couple of weeks ago, I interviewed Adam Fisher.
[02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:06.820]   He's the author of a new book called Valley of Genius,
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:09.180]   the Uncensored History of Silicon Valley,
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:12.620]   as told by the hackers, founders, and freaks who made it boom.
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:13.740]   It's a book.
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:15.740]   And you read their quotes.
[02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:17.340]   But Adam told me something interesting.
[02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:19.700]   He said, you know, this book is based
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:22.980]   on hundreds and hundreds of hours of tape
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:26.180]   with over 200 of these amazing people who
[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:28.300]   made Silicon Valley what it is today.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.980]   I said, Adam, forget the book.
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:32.740]   That's a podcast.
[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:35.460]   So on this feed, from now on every week,
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:37.820]   you're going to get a little snippet of one
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:40.820]   of Silicon Valley's greats.
[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:45.100]   In some cases, it's an interesting environment.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:49.500]   He went all the way to Paris to talk to Tony Fadel
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:51.660]   and followed Tony around on a motorcycle
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:52.820]   to get the interview.
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:58.700]   He talked to Wozniak at his favorite beanery in Silicon Valley.
[02:00:58.700 --> 02:00:59.900]   I had two goals in life.
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:02.060]   One was to be an engineer, and the second
[02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:03.540]   was to be a fifth grade teacher.
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:05.020]   And I did that for eight years.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:07.180]   So there is a lot of atmosphere in this.
[02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:10.540]   There's some amazing quotes and conversations.
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:13.140]   And I hope you will listen to Valley of Genius
[02:01:13.140 --> 02:01:15.260]   starting next week right here.
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:18.060]   Subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:21.660]   Look for Valley of Genius and get episode one next week.
[02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:22.340]   Please subscribe.
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:23.940]   You won't want to miss a minute.
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:24.820]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.740]   Thanks for listening, and I'll see you next week
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:27.980]   with Valley of Genius.
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:32.500]   Valley of Genius there.
[02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:34.580]   It does look like a very interesting show indeed.
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:37.780]   Sadly, however, this Sunday's tweet is coming to an end.
[02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:40.620]   But let's thank our distinguished panel.
[02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:42.060]   Dwight, based out in Houston.
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:43.460]   Thanks very much indeed.
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:46.860]   Anything coming up this week that we should be aware of on your end?
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:49.460]   No, it's business as usual for me.
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:51.900]   I'll be very interested in watching the Apple event
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:54.100]   in the middle of the week this week.
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:58.420]   I think that should be really entertaining for two hours.
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:01:59.780]   Two hours.
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.020]   Apple staff is going--
[02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:02.540]   I'm making sponsored.
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:05.380]   There's all gozoms throughout at the latest new latest--
[02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:08.540]   I didn't know because of it, aren't we?
[02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:09.620]   I don't know.
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:12.180]   I'm sure it'll be beat down to my car.
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:12.900]   And these are smarts.
[02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:14.900]   Thank you very much for breaking off
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:17.340]   where holidays come here.
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:18.820]   Yes, I'll take it.
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:20.260]   You'll probably be judging from the watch.
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:22.620]   I'm suggesting you might be keeping an eye on Apple.
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:24.780]   But because you're a B2B, then--
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:26.580]   I'll be prepping for Microsoft Ignite,
[02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:30.180]   which will take place from September 24th to 26th.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:33.740]   That's when Microsoft basically issues their mission statement
[02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:36.340]   for the next year to tell us where their products are going.
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:37.820]   It'll be kind of interesting to see
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:43.100]   how they pick up on the digital transformation theme that--
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:43.860]   Sunda.
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:44.660]   Thank you.
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:47.460]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.380]   Satcha Nadella.
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:50.860]   Yes, Satcha Nadella has been inverting on after--
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:52.940]   after they finished Mofr's Cloud first,
[02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:54.860]   they've now moved on to digital transformation.
[02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:58.300]   I'm curious to see whether or not AI will make a--
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:02:59.980]   whether or not AI will be the starring player,
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:02.420]   because that seems to have been an emergent theme in 2018,
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:05.420]   especially among B2B that AI will save your business.
[02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:07.580]   So let's see if that happens.
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:08.660]   I don't know.
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:09.660]   I don't know.
[02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:11.620]   Both of them are just looking at each other.
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:13.620]   Right now, they're probably artificial intelligence
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:15.180]   that's made by human intelligence.
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:16.620]   So there's that.
[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:17.860]   And it's not artificial intelligence.
[02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:18.180]   Oh, God.
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:19.420]   I even read Satya Nadella's book.
[02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:20.620]   I feel so bad about that.
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:21.900]   What did you call him?
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:22.580]   I didn't.
[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:23.860]   He called him Sunda.
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:25.460]   Oh, you can't.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:28.860]   Oh, no. No, no. Got that. I just wanted to say Satya Nade,
[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:29.660]   but it just came out real.
[02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:31.620]   No, I was like, so fast man, it's an estimate.
[02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:34.740]   I was just cleaning out my life, cleaning out the book shelves.
[02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.660]   And for some reason, I was still holding on to a copy
[02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:39.620]   of Bill Gates' Business at the Speed of Light, which he wrote
[02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:44.900]   in 1992, "At to Smith the Internet" as just another fad, like CD radio.
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:46.980]   Oh, we should have live tweeted passages from that.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:47.860]   That was so great.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:48.900]   It's a classic.
[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:51.620]   There's a reason I've never thrown it away.
[02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:52.620]   How would we think that now?
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:57.260]   He wrote ahead in which he tried to invent the Internet.
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:03:57.620]   Yeah.
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:58.620]   Well, I have the road ahead.
[02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:01.380]   He's back at my house in Oregon, where I grew up in my childhood bedroom.
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:03.380]   I never read it, but I own a copy.
[02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:03.980]   That's weird.
[02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:04.340]   All right.
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:05.700]   We were geeky kids growing up.
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:08.180]   I was super cool, obviously.
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:10.620]   I had a collection of Stephen J Gould editions.
[02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:13.020]   OK.
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:15.580]   Yeah, that gets me, but still.
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:16.420]   OK, right.
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:18.540]   Well, thank you very much to everyone.
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:19.780]   Thank you for watching in.
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.620]   And another tweet is in the bag.
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:22.420]   Amazing.
[02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:25.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:29.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:32.380]   Do the Twitter. All right. Do the Twitter.
