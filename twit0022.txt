[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this week in tech episode 22 for September 11th, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   [Music]
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   The audience had to make a lot of noise and I forget to turn their mic up.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [Laughter]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   We're at Newton's Bar and Grill in beautiful life spur landing California, the new home of Twit.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   This is the new official Twit Lounge with the leather chairs for John C. Du Boer.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Hey everybody's got a leather chair.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   We have a leather couch over here.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   We're on a beautiful leather chair.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   John C. Du Boer, digital camera.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Four goes, his cow bears game and his Niners game.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   56 to 17.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   That was yesterday.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Oh yes, no Saturdays to football game.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   That's the football game.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Patrick Norton, who knows about these kinds of things.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   [Laughter]
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Roger Chang was a game spot and I understand, well I'll talk about that in just a second and I'm of course on Leo Laport.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Not with us today, missing in action Kevin Rose and David Prager who decided to go to the Niners game instead of coming to go.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Oh man.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And I don't remember hearing I don't know what happened to him.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   But anyway, but we do have a special Twit with us.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Alex Lazy is here.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Good to have you joining us.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Alex of course a regular on call for help.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   He even flies up to Canada, the on call for help that does a Photoshop and 3D stuff.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   He's with the Pixel Core which is the Guild of 3D Designers and Alex and I are going to do an eye piece.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   What are you laughing at?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Every time John pulls the camera.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Yeah bangs the mic.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   That's the mic.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I kind of have to do it with the wrong eye.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   You know, I'll show you, you can actually turn these mics around.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   You just take the head and sense and go like this.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It won't matter.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I'll still be banging it.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Just still in front of me.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's in front of me.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   It's the problem.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Oh yeah, it really wouldn't work behind you.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   You have to kind of.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   That makes sense.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Nice.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Nice.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Nice.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That's the home dough here.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   The thing's squeaking is that.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And as my ear starts bleeding once again.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Did you hear it?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Was that one?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Alright.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   So today this is the beginning of another new chapter in the Twit which is I think this is nice.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We got a nice leather chair.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We've got a bar.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Can we have some bordeaux for Mr. Devorak?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Does it matter what kind of bordeaux any bordeaux will do?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   None will be good.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I don't think so.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Single bordeaux.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Yeah, so that's right.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Yeah, you got that down, Rie.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   40 of bordeaux.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I'm very, you know, what you like the wide mouth of.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Well actually we have Claw here.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Spock Avril, who is a viewer who came all the way from Reno, makes this stuff.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Well can I come up to the red microphone Spock Avril and explain what Claw is?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Well, Claw is a beverage which I throw together which I start out with a bunch of cocoa powder.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Then I run the water through it about four times.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You're doing this in like a Mr. Coffee.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Yep, and a Mr. Coffee automatic drip coffee pot.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Then after the chocolate water has gone as dark as coffee regularly is.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I take it and I dump it through Folgers with cinnamon mixed into it.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It adds up becoming so strong that if it weren't in a plastic container it would probably dissolve the floor.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Oh, cool.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And we're going to have Patrick's wife Sarah be the official taster.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah, don't worry it is safe.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   We've asked for Glasses advice.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   We'll have Ice Coir a little bit later on.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Thank you Spock Avril for bringing that on the plane.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I'm surprised that the TSA.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It was the bus.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It wasn't the plane.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Oh, you made it in the hotel.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   No?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   No?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   You took a bus here?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yep.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Oh, you're flying there.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I got the 4.30 this morning.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Oh dear.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I was up till two o'clock last night making all of this.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Oh dear.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And who says the Twit Army is off?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I'm a Twit isn't.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I'm a Twit isn't.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So this is this week's Tech-A-Mated.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Highly.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Weens we talk about Tech.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Of course the big story probably is the Apple keynote on Wednesday.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Oh, let's talk about something really scary.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   What's that?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Microsoft has decided.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Cut off the Apple story.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   You're going to say move on.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Just like that.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Apple, OK, Motorola rocker.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   All right, I'll tell you what.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Let's do Microsoft.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Right.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   All right, we have a couple of Nanos here.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Patrick brought one.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And that's pretty.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I like it.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It's very pretty.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And then Alex brought one too.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Neither of these are black.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Couldn't they couldn't you get the black?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   They were sold out.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Didn't even think to ask for one.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Oh, see, Alex wrote.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I thought of asking for one.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I want them.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   They were sold out very quickly and they're waiting for more.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We're going to do a mod.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   We're going to color it with a black magic marker.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   So, I agree with you.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   The rocker is like, in fact, already people are complaining about it.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Well, they can't get it connected to the iTunes.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   This is the phone.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   That's the phone.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Did you know that the phones hacked already?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Is it?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Yeah, there was a, on Friday I got a memo about it.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And somebody, there's a site, I guess, in Canada or someplace.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We've got the whole phone hacked.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And now, you can download the software and use it on older Motorola phones.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   You don't even need it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   You just need the software.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Because I'll put a link on my website about it.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   That'd be great.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   What is it?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Dot org slash blog.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah, I get to do it.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   You take a bunch of flack every time I mention it.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   You know, I'm going to play at the end of this show instead of the normal doing the tweet that
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I play, Ashley Twitt, who are doing the tweet, has made a new song called, "I Get No Spam."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Have you heard it?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   No, but I was expecting it.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I get ridiculed for the fact that I get no spam.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And I understand that.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You're not ridiculed.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It's not ridicule.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It's a, I'm rich.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I praise.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's like wrongful people.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Everybody says, "You know what it is?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   It's a tagline.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You have a tagline."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It works for me.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   You know, Gary Coleman had what you're talking about, Willis.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   You know, right?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Donald Trump had your fire.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   You're fired?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Everybody needs a tagline.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah, I get no spam's mind.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   It's not a bad one.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   No, it's okay.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   It's very modern.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   We're talking with ThinkEek.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   They're going to do a whole Twitt line of merchandise.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And one of the shirts is going to be your face.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   If this is all right, you have to prove it.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Oh, of course.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   That says, "I Get No Spam."
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And you're in the house.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   As long as you have the Neethis says, "W-W-W," the Lark that works.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   That's why I'm not going to have a problem.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I don't have a problem.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So, the rocker's been hacked.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It was kind of a boring phone anyway.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And the thing that people wanted to do, which was download the iTunes right into the phone, you can't do, right?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Well, but the thing is, it sounds like the phone companies want that to happen.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   They want to charge you two bucks a song or something like that.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So, why didn't that happen?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I bet you Apple didn't want that to happen.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I mean, why'd you go through the iTunes music stuff?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I think also, I mean, if it's two bucks per song, it kind of takes the amount of two bucks.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   It's a buck 99, a ringtone for a 30 second ringtone.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   That's amazing that that business is...
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   That's a $3 billion business.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's $3 billion.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It's amazing that people share their own business.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   It's amazing that people...
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It's baffling.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   My phone's set to vibrate.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   That's it.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I mean, I don't have any...
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   That's my ringtone.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   That's my ringtone.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   That's vibrate.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Yeah, I was one time sitting on air at Tech TV and my phone went off.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   From then on it.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Vibrate.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Vibrate really works.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I'm looking to 4x watch the 9 years.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   It's just looking...
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   That's it.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I'm not watching.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Now you're on radio here, basically.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And now you're like telling me...
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   You're right.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   You're not doing anything.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And mention the fact that Leo's sitting here stark naked.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You don't have to tell me that.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   We were supposed to say that at the end.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   That was a surprise.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's been big.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It's been big.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   He's been sitting here.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's why I'm looking away.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I was looking at...
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   You know, soccer girls ratings.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   She does her podcast from the bathtub.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And I thought it'd be good if I did buy naked.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   From Noonan's.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Have you seen soccer girls?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   That's my new tagline, by the way.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I'm not seeing Noonan's.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I'm not seeing Noonan's.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Yeah, this will pack him in next week.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It's a...
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   People don't know that every radio station in World War II is...
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Every radio station in World now has two or three TVs in the studio.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And half the time, people are doing the radio shows are like this.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Watch them.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Of course.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   They're not paying any attention to this show.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   The collars call in and you can tell.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   You were on Larry King.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   He's doesn't pay any attention.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   He fell asleep.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   During the interview.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   One time, yeah.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Just the one who was doing the radio show.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I never told you this story.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   It's a great story.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Basically, he's interviewing me.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   He works all day.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   So he said, "Nigh."
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   He said, "Midnight."
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Or whatever.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   So he falls asleep.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And the funny thing was that he's running through these phone calls.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   He's...
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Des Moines.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Alvar Carke.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   He's running through him.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   He's cutting people off.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's just unbelievable.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Then he falls asleep.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And there's some...
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I don't understand.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   He's sitting there.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   You're doing a radio show.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   He nods off.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Yeah, he's dead out.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And he's...
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Is his head on the table?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   No.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   He's just like...
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Ow.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And so he's far enough away that you can't nudge him.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   So...
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And you really don't want him.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   He's Larry.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   So I got some guy who is a really boring guy talking.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And I look over Larry's out.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And so I...
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   So I mean, well, everybody else is wondering, what I think I cut off what this boring dude is going on, you know?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And so I said to the guy, "You got any other questions?"
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And you know, Larry, you know, this guy not really on...
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Oh geez, you know, I got dead air here.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   So luckily he woke up at the very...
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   He snapped out of him.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   You know.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Muncy.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Cincinnati, go ahead.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   That was a great radio show.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I think he's much better on the radio.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Many people are.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   So the rocker, I think singular's benefit of course is they want to charge $3, $2, $3 of...
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I don't think they're...
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And they get the air time and Apple won't let him.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Apple's benefit is it's a big ad campaign for iTunes.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Well, I have to admit, I mean, after you see...
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Did you see the ad?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Yeah, it's all about iTunes.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   It's all about...
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I mean, I have to...
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I was on the way here in my phone ring.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   You know, while I'm listening to my new nano.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And I was like, it would be really...
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I didn't know if it stopped.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   The marketing started to sink in.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I was like, it would be nice if I just hit something on my phone, on my iPod, and was able to answer the call and not have to switch on my ear headphones or...
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   There have been phones that have done this since the year 2000, by the way.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   This is nothing new.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   I mean, MP3 playing phones.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   You should need a Prius, or one of the cars, where the Bluetooth...
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Exactly, it's a car.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   The phone ring's engine stops.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And then you can...
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   You're close to a stop.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Or you know what?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Be better if you could steer a laugh right today.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Right?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   You get no substance in this show, I can see.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   We're getting there.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   We're getting the substance.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Patrick has a story with substance.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Well, like a half dozen, but...
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   He's really suspicious.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Anyhow, Rogers got a pointer.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Let me write that date down.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But I think that a lot of people are waiting to see if they were...
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Who are we going to see video?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You know, I think that was the...
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   That was the secret.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Yeah, that's going to be a while.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   That's going to be a while.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   I think it was more hope than...
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I know it was one of my hopes.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   But the problem is, what are they going to play?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I mean, PlayStation and Japan actually has a bunch of downloadable television created, so there's something other than...
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Overpriced UMD movies available for the PSP.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Creatives going, "We've got the ultimate player for your content!"
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Everybody goes, "Where's the content coming from?"
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   They go, "There are a number of legal sources!"
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Are you trying to play video on the rocker?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Well, I mean, the...
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   The thing is, is that Apple has had a video player floating around internally for years now.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And it's just a matter of when they're going to...
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Steve's the roadblock, right?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Well, it's just a matter of when the market is...
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And the bottom line is...
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   They're making so much money on this thing, why should they...
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   When the numbers start to flatten, flat line, boom, here comes the video.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   They always used to say in the mainframe business, the IBM would do that, that they would hold on to innovation so that they would continue to sell.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Yeah, it's a business.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's not doing it as a favor as...
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   It's dribble them out.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And this has got three years of...
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I mean, this is gonna...
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   The Nano is incredible.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Don't you think this is the product of the year?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I wouldn't call it that, but it's pretty cool.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I call it a "what's a better product"?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   It's still 10 million of them.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   What's a better product, right?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I mean, I think that when we see the limited release of the EVDO stuff that Verizon is gonna be putting down at the end of the year, that'll be something that'll be in the ballpark if the interface is in the end.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   You mean more than VCAST, something else that they're doing?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Yeah, well, I mean...
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Because they're already doing VCAST with the EVDO, they're doing video on a phone.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   This is in LA, it's available at...
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   It's actually San Francisco's gonna get it any day now.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And it's full-motion, you know, 30 frames...
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   2.4 megabits per second to the phone.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Yeah, wow.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   You can't connect to your notebook.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Wow, they wouldn't want you to do that, would they?
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Well, they do.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   They just did you a video or a hand-held, that new standard, that DVD...
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Well, the EVDO is basically...
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's high-speed data to your phone.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   One of the things they're gonna do is push video down it, but it'll also be high-speed data, I mean.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   But they're solving the content issue by making...
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Amped mobile was making tons of...
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   They've already got, like, Discovery, they've got CNN, they've already got some good cable channels on there.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   I think they need to...
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Twit.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Did you see, by the way, that Twit was featured in the nano site?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Wasn't that cool?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   If you go to the nano site, you know, they have a great flash.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   They're actually just quick-time demos.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   If you click "podcast," it plays a...
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   ...it plays "Twit," not sure why.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   They didn't mention it was in the copy, though, which is kind of annoying.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   No.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   But they mentioned...
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   But they mentioned Adam Curry.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   They did actually...
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   The ABC News, Adam Curry, ESPN, Casey, and Appu.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Apple pays him to do that podfinder podcast.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So basically you're telling me that a little copy that was written there is essentially corrupt self-promotion?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   No.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   No, it's profitable self-promotion.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Those are all the people that are supposed to be in the top 10 instead of us.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Alright, Patrick.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   We have now drained this subject, right?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   You may bring up something about Microsoft.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Okay.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Big shock.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Disturbing shock.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   No patch coming this patch Tuesday.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   What?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   But it's patch Tuesday.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It's patch Tuesday.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It's kind of like it's like, yeah, so there's...
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   It's not that there's nothing to fix, but this is one of my favorite Microsoft lines ever.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Occasionally the testing process in our strict focus on quality can result in a month where no security updates are released, as is the case for 13 September.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Oh, see, they missed the boat.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Stop the presses.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   They missed the boat.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   They should say, "No, it's all fixed.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   We're secure."
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   We're done.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   We're done.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I mean, there's their opportunities.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Now I just invite hackers.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Well, it's even more scary.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   You guys seen there's been a couple really good articles floating around on Windows Vista.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   There's two kind of themes for the articles.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   One is that there's going to be seven SKUs.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   There's going to be seven different basic Windows Vista products.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   There's the one for Indonesia.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   There's the starter edition, the home basic edition, the home premium edition, the professional edition, the small business edition, and my personal favorite, the ultimate edition.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Oh.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   No, what happened to the platinum edition?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Well, apparently the platinum edition is the ultimate edition.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   That's the ultimate edition.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   That's the ultimate edition.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I mean, they hire.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   I think it comes up with this was a marketing scheme.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I mean, what actually differentiates between all the tiers of the box, apparently?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Well, Windows Vista Ultimate Edition is a super set of both Windows Vista Home Premium and Windows Vista Pro Edition, so it includes all of the features of both of those product versions.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Plus, as, and I quote, "The game performance tweaker with integrated gaming experiences, a podcast creation utility under consideration, and the performance of the product version."
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Under consideration may be cut from product.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Online club services.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Wait a minute, online what?
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Online club services.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   What's this supposed to mean?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Is that like a blog game?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   No, no, no, it's exclusive access to music, movies, services, and preferred customer care, i.e.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Right.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Support.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   That's just the money making scam.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Yeah, it's a monthly fee.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   From monthly fee.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   From Microsoft?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Doesn't this sound like a lot like GM?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   I said this before and I'll say it again.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   This company is dead in the water.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   They're flat lined.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   They're looking worse every minute.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   This is a desperation move, seriously.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   But the good news is, no patches.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Security.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   We took the week off.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Nothing went up to their burning manners.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Yeah, that's what it was.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   They have time to do the patches.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   You say we heard burning man.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Did you go to Burning Man this year?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   No.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I thought you had the burning man.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   You know, here's the worst part is I have friends have gone since the first one.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And I think about going two days before Burning Man every year.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Oh, I should go and then I do some research and I can't go two days before.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Well, you can't think about it two days before you can't get a, you can't find anything.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   You can't, you know, it's every minute.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   What do you need?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I have balance.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   What about a burning man?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   When I step up to the microphone, I'm burning.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   There's a man who's burning.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Who here has been the burning man?
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   He was here.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   He was there this time.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Okay.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   How was it?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   It was great.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   What's great?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Cousin Bob.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Cousin Bob was at Burning Man.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Who were you naked?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   No.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Okay.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Bob, you look like a guy.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   I just want to make sure.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Not everybody.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   My wife is naked.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   My wife describes it as naked men on bicycles.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Actually, one of the biggest events there is naked women on bicycles.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And but they're all lit up right there.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   What lights in the wheels?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   No, no, they're all painted up actually.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   People are on fire.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   The bicycles are the women.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Followed.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   So, Cousin Bob, is this your first Burning Man?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Have you been before?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Fifth.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Wow.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   So, you're just a regular?
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Would you say is how has Burning Man changed over those five years?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Well, I don't know how much it's changed as much as I've changed.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   So, got more and more used to it as I get to prepare better and have a better time up there.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And your drug tolerance is going high.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Hey.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Not everybody is.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   14 years ago, they discovered I had already done my lifetime supply drug.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   So, I go up cleaning so.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Good man.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   That's great.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   That's great.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   You allowed to have a claw because we'd love to have a couple of clogs.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   I'll try.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   When the glasses with ice canaryone.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Or get the one guy who tries it.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   It's just a highly caffeinated beverage.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   So, how would you characterize Burning Man for somebody who doesn't know what we're talking about?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Burning Man, it's kind of a, I don't know what you call the, I mean you could say it's an experiment in autonomous community creation, centered around.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Basically, they go on the desert and people do that.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I learned it from you.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Oh.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   You mean the voice or the, the, the copy, he just comes up with these like, who read it from the website?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Marketing speak.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   It's just amazing.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   At his desk, he probably just has like a list, a row of words.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Marketing generator.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Basically, a bunch of people go out in the desert and get weird.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And just create their own little society.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It is a small town that just appears.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   They create an infrastructure to support 25, 30,000.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I make the argument that it's actually a modern version of the Mardi Gras.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Essentially, it takes play, you know, in the irony of course, is that New Orleans, hello.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   New Orleans was destroyed as Burning Man was going on exactly at the same time.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I just thought the symbolism there was too much to ignore.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Coincidence?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Coincidence?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   I think not.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   But it's a, it's a Mardi Gras like celebration where people, you know, just kind of let it all hang out.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   One had too much water, the other one has that enough.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   You know, Venice is big and carnival too.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I wonder if there's a, thank you very much.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   There are the Niners made an interception.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   The Niners must have done something.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Yeah, they got an interception.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Same little spout time.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I would like to ask the Niners to kind of coordinate their good plays with our jokes and things will work much more smoothly here.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Well, until recently their good plays were all jokes themselves.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Oh, that's like, ooh, sorry.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I guess I missed a softball like that.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   So five skews, excuse of Vista.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Seven.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Seven skews of Vista.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Do you think consumers are confused by all this variety?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Sometimes I think consumers just want a simple, I still get a lot of calls on the show saying, what's the difference between pro and home?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Do I need XP? What do you do?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   On the other hand, people do want the ultimate edition.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   You know, you don't sell more because it's the ultimate, right?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   There's a certain group of people will buy.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   So it's gonna be the bling edition.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   The bling and the Ag's.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   The golden crust of the table.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Come with the watch.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Come with the watch.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Comes with the on star button on your keyboard.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   On star.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   That's what we need.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Hey, that's really not a bad idea.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Windows with on star.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   I've lost the, I've lost in this application.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   How do I get back?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   I can't find my cursor.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I lost my password.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I'm locked out.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   We'll lock you unlocked for you.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   That's the worst job ever.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   What do you do?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I'm tech support for XP on star.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Don't you don't you love those on star ads where you know, I've just crashed my car down a ditch.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   It's okay.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   I like the one with the kids.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Where they describe.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   There's kids trapped in the car.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Who will help me win my air blags deploys?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Like you're too young to be driving a car anyway.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Who will help me with the blue screen of death?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Microsoft on star.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   On call.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   And you know you're going to be paying like $3 a minute for that phone call after your, you know, 40 minutes of free connection time.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   So what's the next topic?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   I was setting you up for another softball.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   You let it go.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   That's okay.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   That'd be otherwise.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It's waiting for the money.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   There's plenty of softball from you.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Scary thought.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   So how about the massive system requirements on Vista or the, from the straight from the...
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   What are, what are the system requirements?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   What's the main memory?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   The main memory actually, if you really wanted to actually function for the 64 bit, they're talking about two gigabytes.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   What?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Hold on.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Windows Vista 32 bit will work ideally at one gigabyte.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   The minimum is 512, excuse me, one gigabyte, minimum is 512 megabytes.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   And for the 64 bit, because of the way it's handling data, they're recommending two gigabytes.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   That's cheap nowadays.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   That's nothing to get worked up the rest.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   The problem is that's the problem is that you're pushing the limit.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   I mean, what's the maxis thing you'll handle with?
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   It's handling.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   I would hope so.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Well, what's really actually kind of scary is the graphics requirements because it's basically rendering everything out.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Everything's a vector on the screen now.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   It's not bit mapping.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   It's just like, for performance on graphics, for 2D graphics, you need like 128 or 256 megabytes of maximum.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   It'll help if you have PCX press on your video card.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Is that kind of like quartz extreme?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Yeah, it's similar.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I mean, my laptop has 128 megabytes of VRAM.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I mean, it's not standard, but it's --
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   You actually had a special order, but that's because you wanted to use motion.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Right, right.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   So it's not that far away from OS 10.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   I have to admit, because it's -- I mean, OS 10.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   I mean, you can stand without a gigabyte of RAM.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   It's just --
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   No, it works fine at 512.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   It works fine.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Yeah, it works fine.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Yeah, how much is in your notebook?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   1.6.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And how much is in the system at home?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Two.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And how much is in the other system at home?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   No, I have a couple with 512.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Oh, that works fine.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Those are owned by the children, though, right?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   That's what it is.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I just wanted to make sure we had that clear.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   I chat works great at 512.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   No, no, you can use it in 512, but you're right.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I mean, it works more.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   But I have to say, I mean, right now, both Mac and Windows XP 512 is good, and you don't
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   get a huge bump unless you're using high-end applications going over 512.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   You get incremental increases.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   But this sounds like you're going to start at a gigabyte of your--
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   It's going to be a decent one.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   It's going to be interesting.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   It's going to be interesting, and what they're saying is none of the available TFT monitors
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   are going to be able to play HDVD or Blu-ray because they're all going to require an HDCP
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   monitor.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Oh, then that's for copy protection.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Right.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Oh, that's pathetic.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I'm telling you, these guys are killing themselves.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   I think that DRM is what's going to drag my--
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   That would be hack-by-the-back.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   --on the hallway to the bottom of the scene because it's just--
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   There's no way to-- it's just not going to--
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I think it's going to drag Apple to the bottom of the scene, too.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   I mean, I think Apple is in the same boat.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Any big company that wants to be in bed with the movie companies and the record companies
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   is going to have to support this stuff, and you're right.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I mean, I don't think it's a good thing.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   You're right.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   But I think that it's going to hurt Apple as much as it hurts Microsoft.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   I think that depends on the-- I think that depends on the how fast IPTV expands.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   There's a lot of people who can be successful without copy protection.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And if those niche markets start to explode, you know, and what--
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   I don't mean us sitting around the table.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   I mean, like, if Wired Magazine, for instance, decided it wanted to run its own--
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   run it to run its own little show, for instance, they'd have half a million viewers on show one.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   They'd have a million viewers on show two.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Well, I think that's inevitable.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   I mean, I think the current structure is going to collapse.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   It's just quite timing.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   But for them, copying it around is just marketing.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   They don't need to do any DRM.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   They don't need to slow it down.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And if magazines like that start to push down the path, it's--
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   How do they make money off it?
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   They don't need to.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I mean, the thing is--
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   They got to pay for the bandwidth.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   How do they pay for the bandwidth?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   You do some kind of varying a bit torrent.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Well, this raises an extra $500.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   I agree with you that those bit torrent makes everything cheap.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Do you think we're going to see peer-to-peer technologies be mainstream
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   so that they're easy to use?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I mean, right now it's only Geeks can use it.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I mean, is that-- that's key to this all working.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I think people are going to build it if someone doesn't--
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   I know what it means to another layer to make bits more and very useful.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Well, then you put it in-- here's where it will happen.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   If somebody will put it in a client and just say, "Don't ask.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Just keep running the client," or "Always run in the background."
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And then people are going to just read the--
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Actually, in the early days of Napster, there's a lot of people
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   that didn't realize they were uploading and downloading at the same time.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Right.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   But I think people scream blood in the--
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   You're doing like, "Yeah, if you're doing 4.5 gigabytes of video,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   you might notice that."
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   I mean, at the PIXACORE, we're working on a player that just sits in the background
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   and just constantly is uploading.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Don't you think people are going to freak out when they say,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   "Well, wait a minute.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   You want me to run this all to 10?"
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And our ISP is going to freak out.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Well, it just depends on whether it's throttled or not.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I mean, if you start--
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   You get throttled.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I have throttled my bit toward it, 16 kilobytes a second.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   That's fine.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Exactly.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   So if you throttle it, because you don't need--
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   If you have 2,000 or 3,000 people uploading at 10K a second,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   it's going to be enough to supply.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I've never seen that many.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   No one time that.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   But that's what I'm saying is that this isn't going to work unless it's universal.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   That's one of those things where you need not just a small subset.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   You need a lot of people to kind of--
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Look what happened with the video of our last TwiKest,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   because Kevin made a video.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   It's 500 megabytes.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And for the first 5 hours--
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Did they compress it a little more than that?
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Well, it was an hour and a half.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   It's on a CD, by the way, if anybody--
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   For a lot of it was you.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   They couldn't compress my ass.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I had a good line in that about the time.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   It was great fun.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   I didn't get it until I listened back and I said,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   "Oh, I get now when he was stuck."
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   They needed those wide screens.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   You're pan around me.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   You're pan around me.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   You're pan around me.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I get it a week later.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Trying to slip them in.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Isn't that a kind of a weird dichotomy?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   I mean, everyone's pushing higher depth,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   but everyone wants smaller files.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   That's the problem.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   I mean, here, this is a big file.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   This is what, a 30 megabyte file.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   But people have kind of gotten used to that.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   But you go to 500, all of a sudden, there was a lot of complaints in the--
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   The bit to our client in the first few hours was saying,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   "It's going to take you 11 days to get this file."
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Eventually, when enough people seated,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   it was now pretty quick.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Three or four days later, it was very quick.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   But in the first few hours, it's like--
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And if it worked very popular, and if you didn't have a lot of people
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   who are leaving their client open,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   a lot of it has to be also cascading them.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Well, yeah, when once you get used to using BitTorrent,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   you don't pay attention to that stuff, you just run it.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And then you hope to God that, you know, when you come back,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   the thing is downloaded.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   It's not that they're wrong to appeal.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Set it and forget it.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   It's a total crapshoot.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Well, I mean, I think--
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   That's who needs to market it.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   We need to get wrong to put appeal for BitTorrent.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   It would do it.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   You know, we will-- in the Pixel Core,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   we'll actually send out as much as, you know,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   two terabytes to everyone.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I mean, two terabytes of transfer.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   It'll be up to two or three gigabytes to everyone in the Pixel Core.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Hundreds over a handful of people.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   To a couple, you know, to maybe 1,000 to 2,000 people.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And that all happens, but the thing is, is they all come to it
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   almost at the same time.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   You cascade it a little bit, so 10 people have it,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   then 100 people have it, and then you tell everyone, go get it.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   That's how you have to manage the release.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   You have to rolling releases.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And if you have an automated system, you can do that automatically.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   So you can say, you know--
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Instead of having the current dog pile.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Exactly.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   So you hit a 10, and then you hit 100, and then you hit 1,000.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And you can measure bandwidth.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   There's all kinds of ways to handle it.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Some of the content distribution that works providers are starting
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   to kind of cozy up to BitTorrent like that.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And that's certainly how systems being handled.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   But it's kind of a private system that--
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   An Akamai style distributed--
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Where you're actually basically using an Akamai style set up to
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   seed regional servers or regional boxes that'll host BitTorrent
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   for people to download from.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   But it still also requires people to actually leave that upstream up
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   after they get their downloaded.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   We found that 60% of-- I mean, you would upload by the time you
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   downloaded it.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   You uploaded 60% of what you downloaded, you know, just in the
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   period of time that you were downloading.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   So it actually doesn't require--
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   How many people can current users?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   That was probably three, four hundred at a time.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   You don't see what happens when you get up to 30 or 40,000
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   and how it starts to scale.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And that's how it's going to have to scale.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I mean, you just talk about half a million people a week.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Well, you don't-- you're going to have to scale very well.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   I mean, I know like-- because we're dealing with this getting ready
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   for Mac break, because Mac break will be a big--
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   How big is that?
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   We're going to have our show.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   It'll be four or 500 megs.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   We're doing some tests.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   We may be shooting it.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Mac break actually may be 960 by 540, which is bigger than
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   broadcast.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Yeah, you know, people are sticking these four by three.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   We don't have to.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   We don't need to.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   We're looking at shooting on the Sony Z1Us.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Oh, not the U.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   That's what I use.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And then--
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Actually, their lenses are--
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Okay.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Yeah, I mean, they have--
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   It's a really good camera if you just have it set up in a single spot,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and you have it pushed in, but if you actually have it pull out a little bit,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   it's actually really hard to kind of get a clear focus.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   So the lens has some curvature in the corners?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Yeah, it's a Carl Zeissland, so it's like the last thing you think.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Yeah, that's the Carl Zeiss doesn't really exist anymore.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   It's a Sony front.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   So it's--
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I mean, you know, I--
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   It's a brand name that they--
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   It's kind of funny, because I think the old X1 lens--
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   The X1 lens, the floor at lens is actually better.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Well, the XL1 lenses are by far better.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   The other one that look--
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Is the JVC, which is a little more expensive.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   They've got all--
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   You know, you can really put on some great lenses.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   There's also a JVC HD.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   It's all HD.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   These are all HDV.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   I mean, the big one is--
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   The big one that everyone's waiting for is the HVX200 from Panasonic,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   and a lot of us are holding our breath.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   I thought that was supposed to be up by now.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   It might have been.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   But it looks like it'll actually hit stores in December.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   You don't really want to do internet video in HD, though.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Do you mean the files?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   No, but don't you just want to get it in HD,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   just in case you can always down with it.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   It's not like you're recording a football game or the Olympics or something.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   I mean, this is like--
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   No, you know, the letterman just switched to HD.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   At least locally.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Maybe it's naturally--
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   He had it before, but I was--
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   You know, I watch HD.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Leno's been HD for a while.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   He was one of the originals.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And so I'm watching this.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   You know, the show is just so much nicer.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   I don't kid.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   There's no reason to watch.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   You know, you're right.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   A football game is great in HD, but you know, just to watch the regular show.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Once people get used to it, they're not going to want it.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   It's just a better experience.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   I mean, it's crystal clear, and you can see the lettering on the cup,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   and there's all kinds of details you can deal with.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   There's no comparison.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   You don't--
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   You didn't shoot at that way to begin with.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   There's no--
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   No, you can't go back.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Well, and that's what John's saying is to shoot it that way.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   That's the best stuff that's going to show up as HD in the follow-up mark is going to be stuff that was shot on film.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And these sitcoms that are shot on video, if they weren't shot on HD to begin with, they're looking at it.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   They're fuzzy looking when you see them on it.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   I use a big projector, so I have like a 90 in the image.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And so, you know, when you look at anything, it's just like, this is so fuzzy.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   What kind of projector do you have?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   I use a Toshiba.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   You like it?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   What's the resolution?
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   1180 by something ridiculous.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   It's hot looking.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   I love Projectes.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   There's a dark room, and I mean, it's beautiful.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   There's two problems.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   One, you got to be--
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   During the day, you're not going to get anything.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   You got to be within a--
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Well, you have to be-- there's a distance issue, but the other thing is they make noise, and people keep overlooking the factory.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   There's a fan, and that's projected to better the lumens, the noises are the fan, unless somebody--
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   It's really hot when it turns on.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   It's really hot.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   It's like a 200 wide line.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   So you have to turn everything way up, you know, to drown out the fan.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   The other reason for a tech show is because more resolution means the screens will look better.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Screenshots are going to be--
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   That's what we have to be higher resolution than the screenshots.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   So you have to be better than 10, 70, 10, 24 by 7, 68.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Yeah, or close to--
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Close to 30.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Like when we get to 960 by 540, we're getting an image that's actually reasonable to look at, you know, and that's the--
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   I mean, that's what we're kind of considering, but we're looking at 500-- 500 megs probably.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   We're doing 150, and the number one thing we're getting is for the digital life TV, and people want a more--
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   They want like a 30 megabyte resolution, or assuming a 30 megabyte download versus a 150 megabyte download.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   What is it going to look like?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Yeah, it's going to look like a 30 megabytes.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   It's going to look like a 30 megabytes.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   It's actually--
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   I mean, you got to get to something that's small.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   You end up even with H.264.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   You end up going down to a 320 by 240 screen for a 480 by 360, which is what we stream the program out live.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Getting anything below 100 to 150 megabytes is extremely difficult.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Yeah, we get it floating around 120 megabytes.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And we started just doing HD of all our-- basically HD cable we'll get.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   You should HD.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   For certain--
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   We're talking for KX5.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Yeah, for games, for certain interviews, I do shoot HD, and then for all the HD capable games, they record them.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   The game play and all that.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Well, that HD.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Why not?
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Yeah, why not?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And they could always down-sample it.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   I kind of want to do it just because we can't.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Right.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   But I'll be interesting, though, to see how many people download a half a gigabyte of video.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   I think they will.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I think they're--
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Well, these are actually adopters.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   That's the whole thing.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   I mean, it may be-- it's still a niche market, but you're still talking about 30 or 40 million people that have BitTorrent.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And more will get it if-- like a Mac Show, no, there isn't another Mac Show to compete with.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   The ideal, though, I think is to have a dedicated client for the program, right?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   That's where we're going.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   I think that's reliable.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   That's all the BitTorrent for you, and it's just kind of automatic.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   The family's like a horrible vision of like the CNN client on my desktop and the CBS client.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   50 different clients, yeah.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And the Mac Show client.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Yeah, they've got to be a killer app client.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   It's got to be one-- maybe colon will do one.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   What about the DLTV software that's floating around?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Have you used that at all?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Which software?
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Is it DLTV?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Is that what it's called?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Yeah, that-- I just saw that.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Somebody sent us an email with that.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It's not an old God.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   You just not the--
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   No, it's designed for internet television.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   I haven't played with that at all.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Pardon me?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Is it map only?
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I haven't played with it.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Is it an external login sign, real quick?
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   No, it's basically software that runs on OS 10 right now.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   We can-- do we have some more stories that we want to cover?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Should we go to our audience?
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   I haven't even been timing this.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   We're about 4.48.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   We started like 4.13.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Actually, there's apparently a new hole in Firefox.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Yeah, they call-- but it's that IDN against the international domain name system with these non-English characters.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And that's been a problem before Safari had that problem.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   I think Firefox had that problem before.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   There's a patch.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   It's very easy.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   In fact, you could just do it yourself by going about config and Firefox and turning off the IDN support.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   This one to say there is--
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   The work around it.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   This one sounds more like a regular buffer overflow.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   It is.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   It's a buffer overflow taking advantage of the fact that when you use those non-standard character sets in the URL,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   there's the range checking somehow breaks and allows you to do a buffer overflow attack.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   It's serious.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   There's no exploits out there.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Firefox-- and this is a good example of the difference between open source and Microsoft.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Firefox had a work around up within 12 hours and they're promising it.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   They haven't got the patch as if we speak, but I'm sure they will.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   It's an easy thing to fix.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   It's not-- well, I'm sorry.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   It's not an easy thing to fix.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   It's an easy thing to work around by turning off international character sets in your domain names,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   but that will break a lot of websites.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   That would be bad.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Well, not all.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   There must be, I guess, Arabic websites and Chinese websites and websites.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   You know, websites we don't know about.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   You can cut out the Russian spam that way, though.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   I don't get any spam.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Three, two, one.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   John de Vorak.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   It's no spam.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   No, man.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Of course, the question is, did you get all your email?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Yeah, actually, it's a long story.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Yeah, I don't get it.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Definitely, I'm getting started.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   I'm getting started out.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Geez.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   You know, this is a good tagline, though.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   I'm jealous.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   I don't have a tagline.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Yeah, that's a good tag.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Look at this.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Watch your fault.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   No, that's a lousy tagline.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   So if people have questions, Matt, why don't you, Matt's very comfortable and I don't want
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   to get you up and everything but to get up.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Time to be an intern.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Matt Granawitsky, our intern and man about town is going to pass her away.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   That's all we had for the news this week.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Is that it?
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   No, it's very weak.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It's a light week.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   eBay's trying to buy Skype as the rumor.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Trying to tell the guy who's been walking.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   He didn't want to pay too much Skype already.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   He didn't want to buy IGN.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   IGN got sold.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Yeah, IGN, Fox, the basically news score.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Fox is going crazy buying us.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   News score buys my space.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   It's becoming those buys buys.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Now they bought IGN.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Rupert Murdoch's back in the net, baby.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   No, Rupert Murdoch's looking for a younger audience.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Do you remember that Murdoch built in New York City a giant internet studio like seven years ago?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   And they never put it online?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   No, I don't know that.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   They built a beautiful facility.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Is it still there?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I don't know where it is.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   It's a beautiful facility.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Let's go use it.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   It'd be great.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   It was not just a TV studio.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   I mean, it was like a newsroom.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   He had this kind of massive...
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   I never heard this game.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Yeah, I wish I could remember the...
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Does it bring a bell?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   You remember?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Man, Intel sent a bunch of YMAX equipment or pre-YMAX equipment.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   To Louisiana?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   To Louisiana.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   That was the other interesting story.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Yeah, that did a lot of good.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Okay, thank you, Intel.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   How come it's not working?
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   That wouldn't be any good for anybody because you have to be...
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   No power.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Yeah, you have to have electricity.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And nobody has YMAX cars.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   What are you going to...
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   That's crazy.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   That's like Intel saying, "Here's a chance to bake to an ad."
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Well, or it could be Intel saying, "Maybe they'll set up the police."
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.560]   What they were saying is they were sending out
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.000]   "Birlyf workers" and "vegettiveors."
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   They have to do both ends.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Or don't think they were just sending a bunch of routers to a PO box.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   If you find this box, use it to save people.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   You don't know that.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   Yours, Intel.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   You know?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   No, I don't.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   You don't know that in fact.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Because...
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Because...
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Because...
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Because...
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Because...
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Because...
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Because...
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Because...
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Because...
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Because...
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Because...
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Because...
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Because...
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Because...
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Because...
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Because...
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Because...
