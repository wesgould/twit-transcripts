[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.480]   Decemented, disseminated and then regurgitated by Mr. John C. Devorak.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.440]   That is a celebrating show 600 of the No Agenda show today.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.680]   I think they just left finishing the show.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.680]   Congratulations.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.680]   Now that you're two shows a week, you're going to really up those numbers fast.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.680]   That's awesome.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.040]   Thank you, John, for being here.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.720]   Channeled to work and no agenda show.com.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.760]   Patrick Bezha is also here.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.560]   Formerly of the Phileus Club now just...
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   Patrick Bezha.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.800]   You know, just Patrick Bezha.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.040]   Well, you know, there's Lawnde Wutek, but that's for people who speak French, who are
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.400]   sophisticated enough to, you know, embrace the language of love.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   And who do you work for?
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   You have a job.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   Yes.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   I do.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   What do you work for?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   I work for a video game company called Blizzard, so I will be abstaining for commenting on any
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.000]   world of Warcraft news you're going to abstain.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.520]   Are you coming to America for GDC?
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.440]   No, no, I'm not.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   You should.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.560]   I'd like to, but this is really, you know, I'm in PR, so we do more public facing stuff.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   Right.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   Right.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   GDC is where developers meet.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   We had early...
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.840]   I'll be a little bit about that in a second, but I also want to welcome somebody brand new.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.880]   Jill Duffy is here for PC Magazine.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   First time on the show.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880]   Hi, Jill.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   Hi, everybody.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.600]   From New York, New York.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.520]   It's good to have you.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.200]   A gamer, so you can talk about World of Warcraft.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.440]   Ah, wouldn't call me a gamer too much.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.020]   I did work with the GDC group for a number of years with Game Developer Magazine in Gama
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.000]   Sutra, but I know a little bit more about the development side than I know about the actual
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   entertainment side.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   That's an interesting point.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.680]   I mean, I guess you could develop without actually playing them, but I always feel like
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.320]   people would develop games, play them.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.800]   Why are you watching the show, Jill?
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.880]   I went to the thing to find the live pop out chat room.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   You push the button.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.080]   It's not here.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.640]   We broke the internet.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   I don't know.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.000]   Try IRC.tv in the browser bar.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.520]   See that bar up the top?
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.880]   That's where you enter in addresses for the internet.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   Just try I...
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   You said DOT.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880]   You said DOT.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   Yeah, I said DOT.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.880]   That's a mistake.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.880]   It's a period.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   IRC period.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.880]   Okay, P-E-R-I-L-D.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   No, no, no, just put a dot there.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   And then...
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   Dot.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   All right, you got a pen?
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   And double space.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   You got a pen.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.280]   All right, that's a good question.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.600]   I bet you, John, does in fact, after every period when he's using his typewriter, add
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.400]   two spaces.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.600]   You know, that's a funny thing in the mission.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.840]   It's a hard habit to break.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   Well, it didn't...
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   Yeah, it takes about six months, actually.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.120]   So you haven't done it a while?
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.040]   I haven't done it for ten years or more.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.800]   Is it on a computer you don't care about anymore?
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.160]   It just doesn't look right.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.760]   In fact, thinking about it, I'm not sure why it was ever too...
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.760]   Why did we ever do that?
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   That's what I was gonna ask.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760]   What...
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   Where does it even come from?
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   It comes from a typewriter.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   It's monospacing.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   Yeah, monospacing.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   Yeah, a monospacing.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Yeah, a typewriter is used to have different amounts of space in between the characters.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.040]   And once we had computers where we could have different typefaces and things like that,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.200]   the spacing is automatically corrected.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.920]   So you have things like ligatures are easier to type because of spacing issues.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.560]   We now have proper kerning.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.560]   Although I believe in Microsoft Word, you can change it so that if you are one of those
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.600]   habit double spacers, it will always just take it out for you.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.080]   And for cranky editors, there's the find, replace all function.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.000]   I actually remember reading an article.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.720]   This is really nerdy.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:48.640]   But where the two spaces after period came from, and it actually goes way, way back as
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.680]   I remember.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.000]   James Felicci, the author of the Complete Manual of Typography, says that the early
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.760]   history of type is one of inconsistent spacing.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.600]   And he actually refers to monks and manuscripts and things like that.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.760]   This is from creativepro.com.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.880]   And it's about double, I remember reading this, double spacing after a period.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.280]   Here's 1774, Caslon.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.080]   Nice font, typeface.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.880]   In the first printing of the United States Declaration of the Independence, two spaces.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.560]   Wow, look at that.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.720]   This one big space between the periods and the, I don't know how we got into this.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   It really isn't anything.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.800]   It's actually from BEMBO.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   Remember BEMBO?
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.840]   Oh yeah, I knew him.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.040]   You know, I somehow this just kind of stayed in my mind.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   I remember reading this.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.720]   Anyway, did you just find out about this recently that you only use one space?
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720]   Is that the D?
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   No.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.640]   Yeah, I've been typing two spaces and I actually did get in trouble when my kids were little
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.520]   because the fourth grade teacher, okay, there's another one.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.680]   Remember in the old days when you were typing a paragraph, you begin the paragraph, you
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   go in.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.680]   In dent, yeah.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.680]   You tab in one.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.680]   Five spaces.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.160]   And then nowadays we don't do that anymore, right?
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   Rarely.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.640]   So Henry's teacher expected him to tab in.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.440]   Oh, so he looked like a schmuck.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.240]   And I said, "Oh, Henry, we don't do that anymore."
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.240]   And she got, she, I think she graded him down because he didn't tab in.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.000]   Talking about antiquated.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.960]   Yeah, no, I would have taken that.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   I would have sued her.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   Yeah, that's what I would have done.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.560]   You know, I really love coming on this show because usually on the internet, I feel like
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.800]   I'm the older guy.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   I remember a time before the internet.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   Thank you.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   Thank you.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   For making me feel young.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   Hey, speaking of which.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   That's what we do.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.080]   Twenty five years ago, March 12th, 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, he wasn't a sir yet.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.040]   Soon to be Sir Tim Berners-Lee had a twinkle in his eye.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   And then what?
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.520]   He conceived of something he would later call the World Wide Web.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.880]   He wrote a little memo to his-
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.880]   Remember that?
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   I do remember it.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   You remember that?
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.880]   I wasn't there.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.680]   I'm a fellow physicist.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.120]   I am stunned at the number of people who confused the World Wide Web with the internet.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   Did you see-
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.360]   It's actually- I used to be a complaint about this, but now I just gave up.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.320]   To 99% of everybody, the World Wide Web and the internet are the same thing.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   Not true, obviously.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.800]   No, it's not true because your email is not done.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.360]   Well, actually, most of the time it is done on the web.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.240]   If you just type in Happy Birthday internet, you can hold these results from people who
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.680]   think that the World Wide Web was the internet.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.680]   Yeah, the internet-
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   Not true.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.680]   The internet is back in 60 years.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.680]   It's closer to 50 years old.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.680]   Yeah, 60-69, technically.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.080]   But to be fair, it's with the web that it really took off.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   Sure.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.280]   It's really the UI for the internet, right?
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:56.880]   So it is fair to make it the most important and momentous occasion of the internet, the
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.000]   anniversaries of which there are many.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.640]   And we're in the golden age of the internet and the World Wide Web.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.840]   I get 10 years from now, we're not going to be able to do anything.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   It's going to be worse.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   Warren's out.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   Spam is in.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.080]   Foni Bologna ads.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.880]   My favorite ads that you get, these great ads because they're so talented at targeting
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   you.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.720]   As ads for stuff, I just bought five minutes ago on every page.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.200]   Yeah, we're targeting you.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.600]   Hey, people who bought the depends on their garments often buy more depends on their
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   garments.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.840]   And they just show you the ad again.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.160]   I've never seen an ad for them.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.680]   No, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.640]   So I think we could talk about the Malaysia flight.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.080]   There's a tech angle to that.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.320]   No, there's not.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.840]   Well what's interesting is that in this day and age, when in fact I had an airline safety
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.200]   inspector from major US airline in studio a couple of days ago, just by chance, I won't
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.920]   say his name or the name of the airline is big airline.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.160]   And I said, are you guys fast anyway?
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.440]   And I said, yeah, because it's kind of hard to understand what happened.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:10.240]   In this day and age for a plane of that size, for instance, to disappear with all the technology.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.520]   Now we know somebody turned off the transponder.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.040]   Yeah, but there's all kinds of other.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.360]   A cars was turned off and interestingly enough, the transponder was turned off.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.000]   Then he said goodbye, good night to air traffic roll.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.880]   Then he turned off a cars or maybe it's unclear the timeline.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   We don't have things unclear.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.520]   It's very, don't you feel now, are you guys going crazy with this on no agenda?
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.360]   We've decided that the most of the business comprised of lies in the planes probably parked
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.840]   somewhere with a bunch of dead people in it.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.000]   That's kind of how we finished the our analysis.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.760]   Do you think you, whoa, why would they be dead?
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.880]   What are they going to keep them alive for?
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.080]   I'd be great if everyone was, you know, pleased this punch and they were all alive in some
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.520]   remote island or something.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.120]   I don't know, something's crazy about the story.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   We just have to wait.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   I mean, I think the speculation at this point is out of control.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.200]   Oh, it is clearly.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.600]   But don't we love mysteries?
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.240]   I mean, it's like straight out of a lot.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.160]   Yeah, but this is, yeah, it is.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.600]   But this is like, that's too much to take.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.080]   All right.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.120]   So they were eating all right.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.480]   Ooh, I got you off the track, great.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.240]   I'm doing my job chat room.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.440]   But where could the plane be?
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   What could have happened to it?
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.040]   No, just asking.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.960]   All right.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.440]   Did you see, this is a very weak week.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.640]   What about the icon story?
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   Carl icon.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   What's he up to?
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.120]   No, no, they, I, I, oh, I can.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120]   I can.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120]   All right.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120]   All right.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.120]   Are you can't?
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.120]   I don't care.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.120]   The internet corporation for assign names and numbers will, and this is why we have a Frenchman
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:51.620]   with us will no longer be under the eagis of the United States of America.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.820]   And I think you have to blame this a little bit on the Snowden revelations and the fear
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.820]   around the world that the US is perhaps not a benign government.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.060]   On the other hand, this has been going on for a couple of years with Russia and other
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.800]   countries kind of trying to say, no, no, we should run.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   Yeah, this is what you want.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   We want to write it.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   You guys.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.060]   You have Vladimir Putin running the internet.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.120]   What is the, give us the Parisian point of view.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.100]   Well, I don't know that it's the Parisian point of view, but my point of view is definitely
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.140]   in line with, I think we just, we've talked about this on the show before, but in line
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:33.500]   with what you just said, there's definitely concerns about one country having such a
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.060]   prominent role in running the internet.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:42.640]   But on the other hand, a lot of people are saying we don't, we don't want the US to be
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.640]   doing it.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.860]   Maybe partly in it because of the Snowden thing, but also, you know, it had been in the
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.500]   minds of people before that.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:59.980]   And the thing is personally, I think I would rather have the US running it rather than an
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:07.900]   assembly or body, multinational body where China and Russia and other countries that
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:14.020]   are, you know, less reliable than the US or the West in general have their say, especially
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:22.220]   in the internet and where the war about free speech and surveillance is happening now.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.700]   Let me give you the background, a little bit of the background on this.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.220]   And then I have a statement that Vince surf emailed ours, Technica.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.260]   He's one of the fathers of the internet and certainly somebody we respect and admired
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.140]   and a former chair of ICANN through 2007.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.140]   What did he say?
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.500]   So in the early days of the internet, it was invented kind of here, Bolt-Baranek Newman
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:50.260]   under DARPA, SRI, Stanford.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.700]   And there was a guy, John Postle at the University of Southern California, who pretty was the
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.700]   guy.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.020]   He was one guy in his office.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.820]   And if you wanted a domain, a rather a number or a set of numbers, if you wanted to, you
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:08.300]   know, a big piece, you'd go to John and John and say, well, yeah, let's see, wait a minute.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.100]   I'll give you 64.0 dots.
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.020]   How about you want to be blocked and they block?
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.020]   What do you want?
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.700]   I think those days are over.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.220]   So that was the way it should still be.
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.460]   It was enough.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.940]   And then John passed away.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.740]   But even before then, Iana, which was the organization that he ran gave way to the
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.940]   ICANN, the internet corporation for sign names and numbers, kind of under the eegis of the
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:37.700]   US Department of Commerce, more recently under NTIA, the National Telecommunications and Information
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:44.060]   Administration, which is a division of the Department of Congress, Commerce.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.500]   The key is the domain name system.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:57.660]   In 1997, the domain name system was transitioned from basically a government project into this
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.460]   private hands as ICANN, although under the oversight of the United States, ICANN meeting
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.940]   coming up next month in Brazil.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.380]   Brazil and other nations, very upset about the NSA.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.620]   Brazil, in fact, threatened to build its own cloud, its own internet.
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.540]   That'll work.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.700]   Does anybody think-- just to stop your story here.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:24.860]   Does anybody think, if the thing-- let's assume that it was run all along by Russia?
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.060]   Does anybody think that the NSA still wouldn't be collecting the same data?
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:28.820]   Right.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.220]   I mean, I just don't buy that.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.820]   It didn't give many insight tracks.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.220]   This connection between-- yeah.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:40.580]   No, it's just that with the NSA story, there's obviously a little bit more concern about the
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:46.020]   US basically running the internet as some people understand it.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:52.580]   I think there's also a lot of American guilt in that somewhere.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.140]   It's like, oh, right.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:59.500]   We have this imperialistic attitude towards the world, and maybe we shouldn't be running
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.220]   the internet.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:07.140]   I think this is one example where actually we're happy to let you handle this.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.340]   Let you just do it.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.340]   It's fine.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.980]   Yeah, again, at least for me.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.780]   But there's a little bit of that.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:20.580]   Don't you guys feel that sometimes that sometimes Americans feel like they have to be more respectful
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.740]   of the world and--
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.740]   That's interesting.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.780]   We've got to bend over backwards.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.420]   Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.780]   I don't know if it's accurate, but it's a feeling I get sometimes.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.780]   And sometimes it's justified.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.020]   I'm not saying it's completely unnecessary.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:42.340]   I think there is a little bit of over boasting or over obliviousness to the rest of the world
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.340]   sometimes.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.340]   Yeah, there's--
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.340]   In this case, I'm not sure.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.580]   So Vince Serf was a chair of ICA from 2000 through 2007.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.580]   He's now Google.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.900]   He's a fellow at Google.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.940]   He was co-inventor of TCP/IP.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.140]   He sent a statement to RCS.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.700]   He said, "The announced change would ultimately eliminate the contract between ICA and ICA
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.260]   and the NTIA, the contract between ICA and the Department of Congress.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.740]   Why don't you think Congress?
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.420]   Commerce in the US."
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:13.500]   And leave it to ICA and the internet community to create a transparency and accountability
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.900]   regime that's rooted in the multi-stakeholder model of administration.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.700]   What does that say?
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:25.420]   He says, "Basically, this is a major step toward implementing a global system of internet
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.620]   administration where there's no one country."
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:32.540]   No, it's going to go to the UN and the UN's going to implement all the crap the UN does,
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.380]   including all its kind of freedom of speech limitations because of their edicts about
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.380]   hate speech.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.620]   And you're going to see sites disappear.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.380]   Well, that's a hate speech site.
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.380]   I don't think so.
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.380]   It's gone.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.380]   I think that the--
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.380]   Okay, well, you really think that--
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.100]   I'm losing a bet when you say that.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.100]   You want to make a bet?
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.100]   That's too late.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.100]   I already made a bet.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.100]   What was the bet?
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.100]   The bet was with Adam.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.260]   I would say that.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.420]   But you defend this crazy notion that it should be--
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.780]   Well, it's not going to the UN.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.860]   I agree with our French fellow here.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.860]   He's got the right idea.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.860]   That is amazing.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.860]   It's amazing.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.660]   It's not going to the UN.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.180]   It's a UN operation you watch by the end of the day.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.020]   Well, even if it's not the UN, the problem is you're going to have-- if you start giving
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.860]   it to someone else in the US, of course, the situation is not ideal.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.900]   Ideally, it shouldn't be run by one country.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.660]   But still, if you go to someone else, then you can't go to another country.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.860]   You have to go to everyone.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.060]   So even if it's not the US, you are going to have--
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   A bureaucracy.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.060]   You're right.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.060]   You're going to be setting up a--
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.060]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.060]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.140]   And you're going to have to-- first of all, it's a bureaucracy.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.140]   Sure.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.260]   But that's not the-- it's not my main concern.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.100]   My main concern is that you're going to have to listen to China.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:52.900]   And if China has a bunch of deals, economic deals with your country, of course, you're
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.420]   going to want to please them somewhere else.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:01.100]   And as the NSA scandals have proven this horrendous invasion of privacy, people don't
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.500]   associate-- people don't give the weight to the internet that they give to real life.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.340]   Even though we all know in the audience on Twitter that it actually is as if not more
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.940]   important.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:18.580]   And so I do worry that the internet stuff and the free speech aspect and all of that is
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.860]   going to go by the wayside because we have to protect the factory deals and the exchange
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.300]   deals and all of that.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   So if China--
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.300]   I don't think that's going to have--
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.300]   Yeah, I don't think that's going to have--
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.300]   The Department of Congress, Congress--
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.100]   If you don't-- has even said, we're not going to give it up to the UN or another country.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.580]   The IETF has worked very well.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.300]   Where did they said that?
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.300]   Right here.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.100]   Did they not going to give it up to the UN?
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.220]   Commerce officials indicated they wouldn't give up oversight.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.300]   This is from Recode of ICANN to another government or intergovernmental organization which would
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.700]   include the United Nations.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:53.260]   Whoever takes over would be required to maintain the security and stability of the internet
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.900]   domain name system.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.900]   This doesn't make sense.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.780]   Make the needs of global customers and-- according to a Commerce Department statement, quote,
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.900]   "maintain the openness of the internet."
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.900]   This makes perfect sense.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.340]   No, one country should be responsible--
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.900]   Okay, so they're not going to give it to a country and they're not going to give it
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.900]   to a consortium of countries.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:09.900]   It's already something--
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.900]   It's already something--
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.940]   Well, it in effect is a court-sourcing but not just of countries, of stakeholders.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.940]   And it's what the--
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:21.460]   It's how the IETF works, the internet engineering task force, which frankly, arguably is more
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.340]   important because they determine the protocols that run over the internet.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.700]   It shouldn't be run by the US Department of Commerce but shouldn't be run by any country
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.380]   and it certainly shouldn't be run by the United Nations.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:38.020]   These guys have been-- I had been over-- there's been a decade long, this fight.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.100]   I remember I've been down to Icon a couple of times.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.140]   They've shipped you down there and they lecture you about how horrible this is going to be
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.220]   because you're going to have exactly what Patrick said almost through the letter.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.420]   You're going to have these vested interests because you know we can't do this, we can't
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.940]   do that because you're demeaning us, you're demeaning China in the case of his argument
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.780]   and we can't have these kinds of sites.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:04.180]   They have to be shut down, we have to do this and that take them out off the domain system.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.180]   I agree with all that.
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.180]   Well, if that happens, it's scary.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.620]   And if you're right, that's something we want to watch out for.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:14.540]   We know that I think the Americans having it are so paranoid and conscientious that
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.460]   I think we've done a really good job of maintaining this thing.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.540]   It's like you don't look at the internet except for the NSA which is just spying on
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.900]   just streams.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.260]   You don't look at the internet and say, "Jesus, this is going to be poorly managed.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.580]   I'm surprised it's even up today."
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.740]   It's been very well managed.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.900]   It's actually astonishing how well it's been managed.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.140]   But oh, let's fire the guys.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.140]   Let's fix it.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.460]   Oh, let's fix it.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.460]   That's what I see.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.580]   So John is agreeing with me too much.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.620]   It's scaring me a little bit.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.100]   So let's take the other side of your argument.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.100]   Take the other side.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.940]   The internet is made of things that are...
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.020]   It's astonishing that they work and yet they work very well.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.020]   You mentioned Wikipedia.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.220]   I think someone did.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:01.780]   Anyway, Wikipedia is one example where if you describe it, you think it's never going
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.780]   to work.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.180]   There's a bunch of people who can go and edit pages all at the same time, all the way they
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:12.340]   want it to, and we're going to build an encyclopedia out of it.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.700]   It did seem ridiculous a few years ago.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.700]   Actually it works.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:24.780]   Maybe the stakeholders and the people who know how to run this thing will find a system
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:31.300]   which is not necessarily involving the special interests or the particular interests of various
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.740]   countries and will manage to devise a system that will make it collaborative and decentralized
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.980]   and efficient.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.500]   So I hope they will.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.500]   I'm just worried.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.500]   Jill, any thoughts?
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:47.180]   Patrick, well I don't want to jump on Patrick's analogy too much, but I would say that Wikipedia
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.260]   is not really a great analogy because it does have a lot of bias in it.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.100]   Mainly male bias.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.020]   Women don't contribute to Wikipedia and there's a whole culture in history behind why women
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.020]   don't contribute to Wikipedia.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.260]   That's true, there are not a lot of female editors on Wikipedia.
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.220]   Can you believe that?
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.980]   It's like 100%, it's so small.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:07.980]   Really?
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.980]   But why would that be?
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.900]   Is that a discrimination or is there less interest in doing it?
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.500]   It's a very, very big can of worms to open right there.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:23.540]   I mean I could go through the culture of editing and having people respond to your edits,
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.740]   the way people are treated, the way women say I don't want to get into this because
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.980]   I see the way that it happens and what goes on there, the kinds of communications that
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.980]   people are having.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.460]   I don't want to even start with that.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.060]   Yeah, can I interrupt you for a second?
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.060]   Because I think you're missing Patrick's point.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:45.140]   I don't think Patrick was discussing the politics of Wikipedia and why or why not women
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.780]   get on it or anybody else for that matter.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:52.260]   I think he was just trying to say that here's a crazy idea that kind of works that we just
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.260]   stumbled upon.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.260]   Is he central?
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.380]   That did not look like it was going to work and it seemed idiotic when it came out.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:03.020]   What I want to say about the analogy though is that sometimes because of our own perspective,
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.500]   we don't see what's missing.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.780]   We may not see as Americans or as Westerners what's missing from the perspective of just
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.580]   having Westerners or Western countries manage this.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.580]   Right, right.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.580]   Okay, I buy that.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.580]   So I'm not saying it doesn't work and I'm not saying we haven't done a good job so far
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.140]   but could it be better of course?
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:28.380]   It won't be better, my experience and as one of the older guys on the show, my experience
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.820]   anytime anything has changed like this, it just worsens.
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.380]   It's like when they bring in the new boss, the new boss is not as good as the old boss,
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.700]   he's crappy and he just deteriorates it, deteriorates over time and we're going to
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.700]   see the same thing.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.500]   So I'm telling you that this is the golden age of the internet.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.580]   Be happy because you're not going to see it this good in the future.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.700]   You'll see.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.820]   Women typically perceive Wikipedia to be of lower quality than men do.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.940]   This is from Wikipedia's own article on systemic bias.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.820]   Less than 15% of contributors on Wikipedia are female.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.340]   8.5% of editors are women as of a 2011 study.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.500]   So women hate to Wikipedia?
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:18.860]   But what's interesting is that that bias shows up in the way Wikipedia is perceived
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.940]   on a gender basis.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.940]   I had no idea.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:21.940]   Thank you, Jill.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.940]   Thank you.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.940]   I had no idea.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:30.860]   The most common page that people point to is whenever they say the top 100 female American
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.300]   writers and they're like, so the top 100 American writers is all men?
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.260]   Like we weren't allowed to be on that list.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:41.740]   Yeah, because that's American writers and you're female.
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.620]   So let's get this right.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.180]   That's a very good one.
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.180]   Wow.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.940]   Actually, there is a fairly large story and we're going to cover that in just a second
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.940]   about GitHub.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:58.860]   GitHub's first female developer, a woman who was in fact pretty outspoken about the lack
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:04.060]   of or at least the attempt to have a lack of gender discrimination on GitHub.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.300]   Julian Horvath has departed GitHub.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.300]   We'll talk about that.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.380]   And I'm glad you're here, Jill, to represent the is it is it sexist to say the distaff side?
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.980]   I should probably look that up.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.980]   The distaff side.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.340]   Does anybody even know what that means?
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.340]   I do and it's very insulting.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.420]   I think it must be.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.260]   I'm going to have to search Wikipedia to find out what that means.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.820]   Well, you won't get a woman's perspective if you do that.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:34.460]   It's a staff for holding the flax toe or wool in spinning or the second one, a woman's
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.460]   work or domain.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.940]   Oh my God, it is sexist.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.620]   I apologize.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.780]   But at least there are 100 top female writers.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.380]   That's the good news.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.260]   And 100 top male writers.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.260]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.740]   I think these kinds of things are all bull crap.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.940]   Top this top that says who lists or says who lists.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.460]   We've talked about lists before.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.460]   It's all made up.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.420]   They're all made up.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.620]   Did I tell you I got nauseous earlier today?
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.420]   Yeah, you were sick as a dog, I understand.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.420]   You put a virtual reality thing.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.060]   I had a hoculous rift on and then we were interviewing these guys.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:18.300]   This is right before the show who did this amazing kind of mocap suit.
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.300]   What that was?
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.300]   PRIO.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.300]   It's a mocap suit.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.300]   Motion capture.
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.300]   Motion capture.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.300]   Thank you.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.820]   Mocap with all little dots on it.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.780]   It's YEI technology and they have a kickstarter, but it's not.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.780]   So that's what's cool about this.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.780]   It's not a kickstarter.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.220]   They've raised almost a quarter of a million dollars two weeks to go.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.220]   Okay.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.980]   Where you put this really interesting.
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:46.300]   It's nine sensors on your elbows, your tummy, your hips, your knees, your feet, your head.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.380]   And then you could play a game and shoot and stuff and crouch and everything, which is
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.380]   kind of cool.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.380]   Kind of like connect.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.380]   There it is.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.380]   There's a video of it.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.300]   But hey, hi Paul, how are you?
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.700]   He was just here.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.700]   But then see, that's what you're doing.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.700]   Okay.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.700]   Okay.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.500]   But just connect without a sensor because they don't need a sensor because it's smart.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.740]   But then they put the oculus rift on my head.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.740]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.740]   Well, you have.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.260]   And that's the VR monocular vision though.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.260]   But that wasn't it.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:17.220]   It just I felt I took me about 10 minutes and then I just had to take it off.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.220]   It was nauseous.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.860]   Have you ever ever used anything like that?
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.460]   Not that made me sick.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.820]   Oh, do you love you use the oculus?
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.820]   Friendly.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.100]   I can't I'm one of those people I get too much vertigo from it.
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.100]   I can't even play a lot of 3D games.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.100]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.100]   People that can't go to a 3D movie.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.340]   I don't actually.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.340]   I'm the opposite.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.660]   You're the opposite.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.660]   You can't go to a 2D movie.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.580]   2D movies make you sick.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.380]   That's because Hollywood is degenerated.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.380]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:49.820]   I tried the oculus rift and I'm one of those people that doesn't have the stereoscopic
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.820]   vision.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.860]   stereoscope doesn't do anything on me.
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:58.140]   And I was with friends and they were trying it and going like, Oh my God, wow.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.940]   And they were expecting me to do the same.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.300]   And I was just sitting there like an idiot and didn't do anything.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.780]   I was just, you know, looking around.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.020]   And so I'm very sad.
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.100]   I'm not one of the one of the people that can enjoy the oculus rift.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.100]   Yeah, look, so you could do the trailer movements.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.100]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.100]   That's real.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.140]   That looks like a lot of fun.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.660]   Anyway, it was actually was really cool until I got nauseous.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:27.580]   Oh, our show today brought to you by gazelle.com.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:33.020]   Gazelle is a great place to go when you want to get rid of old technology and get ready
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.140]   for new technology, new phone in your future.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.820]   You'd like to get rid of your old iPhone.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:39.940]   Let's just take a look right here.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.820]   What is an iPhone five from 18 T 64 gigs?
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.820]   What is that worth?
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.820]   What do you think, John?
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.700]   205 bucks, maybe or 255.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.700]   It's unlocked.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.700]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.340]   They give you instructions on how to unlock too, which is really cool.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.060]   So wait, they give what would they do that?
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.060]   They have to pay another 50 bucks.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.060]   I know.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.060]   It doesn't seem like a good idea at all.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.700]   No, it doesn't seem like they say it's easy.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.700]   Here's how.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.620]   The reason is they can sell it for more money.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.820]   They can unlock it themselves.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.820]   No, no, no.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.260]   You have to unlock it because you're the customer.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.260]   You have to go to 18.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.020]   So they'll give you 50 bucks if you unlock your own phone, essentially.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.420]   Yeah, because it's worth more.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.420]   Gazelle is awesome.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.340]   They'll even buy broken iPhones, broken iPads.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.380]   You can get cash for your BlackBerry.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.660]   I don't know how many places can get money for a BlackBerry HTC or LG phone, your Motorola,
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.660]   your Nokia, your Samsung.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.660]   You got a Galaxy.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.140]   You know, I think a lot of people have maybe a Galaxy S4 and they're getting ready for
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.140]   the Galaxy S5.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.140]   Here's a nice thing.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:39.420]   Now, I know the S5 is not out, but this quote is good for 30 days.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.060]   So get a quote on all your gadgets and then hang on.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.060]   You have time.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.740]   You have 30 days to take advantage of it.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.540]   Get a new phone, transfer the data over.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.060]   And then when you check out, they'll send you a box.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.620]   They'll pay the postage, throw it all in the box, they'll send you cash.
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:31:01.540]   You can get a check or a PayPal credit get paid fast or if you're an Amazon user, get
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.620]   an Amazon gift card, they bump that up 5% which is nice.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.620]   That's a good deal.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.420]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle like the antelope.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:17.500]   Gazelle's paid more than $100 million to over 700,000 customers over the last few years.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:24.180]   Gazelle.com, sell your gadgets today at Gazelle.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.660]   I don't know if you can use that in France.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.180]   You may have to be in the US to use that.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.620]   Yeah, I don't think we have Gazelle in France.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.620]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.020]   But it's an awesome service.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.100]   It's a great idea.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.660]   So do you know Jill, Julianne Horvath?
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:40.660]   I've not met her.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.660]   I don't know her.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.900]   No, I don't know her.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.660]   So GitHub, we should explain first of all what GitHub is.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:53.660]   It's a very widely used source control software, right?
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:32:00.500]   So if you are working in a group of programmers, you can all work on the same project.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:06.260]   You can check out the latest work, check it back in after you've made your changes, keeps
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.900]   track of version control and all of this.
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:16.540]   GitHub is an open source project, but it also has a website and a commercial side, github.com.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.260]   A lot of people use it.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.100]   It is a great piece of software.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:30.460]   And I always think of it because I like open source as being hip and cool.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:37.540]   And with it, apparently it's not the best culture for women.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.100]   She has worked for GitHub since 2012.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.340]   She says it was fairly small then.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.300]   She said at the time the culture was supportive of the women on its staff.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.380]   She was the only female designer or developer on the team.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.060]   And I remember that she defended GitHub.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.300]   There were complaints, but she defended GitHub.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.260]   She says now I had a really hard time getting used to the culture, the aggressive communication
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.860]   on pull requests and how little the men I worked with respected and valued my opinion.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:11.180]   She wrote this in an email to TechCrunch.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:15.580]   I loved the idea of GitHub because it was a place people went to make things for people
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.860]   who make things.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.900]   She said it was a boys club.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.780]   She felt she was being treated differently internally due to her gender.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:32.420]   And now she's quit.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.620]   Any thoughts on that at all?
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.660]   I think this is really something we need to address in general in the tech industry.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.660]   Absolutely.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.900]   This goes along with a Wikipedia story where women feel like it's too aggressive of an
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:45.900]   environment.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.260]   A place they want to be.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:54.100]   She didn't go into a whole lot of detail about exactly what was said.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:34:00.300]   But she did give an interview with, I believe it was TechCrunch, and kind of mentioned that
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:07.780]   one of her bosses or one of the co-founders wives said, "Let's go out for drinks.
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.260]   I want to talk to you."
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:14.940]   And during this conversation she said it got to be a little bit personal and it got to
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.860]   be a little bit aggressive.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.500]   And the wife was sort of asking her for a lot of details about what she was working
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.340]   on and she was insinuating some things about her work.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:28.460]   And I have a hard time thinking that that's all that happened.
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:33.300]   I have a feeling that this was a building problem that was going on and on and on for
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.300]   months.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.780]   And there must have been something that made, the straw that broke the camel's back, but
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.980]   we don't quite know what that is.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:48.220]   And then Julianne Horvath tweeted at one point, "My only regret is not leaving or being fired
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.220]   sooner.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:54.860]   What I endured as an employee of GitHub was unacceptable and went unnoticed by most."
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.140]   And I think that unnoticed sort of speaks to what I was mentioning before, this bias
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:03.420]   that men don't always see or know about.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.900]   So it's sad that she was there for two years and that she was, I mean two years out of
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.860]   any company is a long time.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.140]   You get to know everybody there and you become part of the culture.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.700]   I kind of hope that she wasn't unhappy that whole time, but I would like to know a little
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.420]   bit more about when on.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.700]   It's hard for women to speak up about these kinds of things because of the retribution.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:32.940]   I believe she at one point got the death threats and rape threats online as all the trolls
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.100]   like to throw at women.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.220]   I kind of wish she would speak out a little bit more about what happened.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.580]   And I think any woman in that situation is going to be afraid of their reputation and
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:48.700]   their career prospects going forward if they become the center of attention and the backlash
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:53.260]   that happens with a back and forth with a bad employment.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:59.260]   And now she's by the way, on secret there's a bunch of character assassination against
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.300]   her, which is sad.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:06.100]   That secret has really become kind of now the place you go if you wanted to fame somebody
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.100]   anonymously.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:13.620]   Yeah, I think there was something that she was notorious for not accepting criticism of
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.860]   her work.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.100]   And I want to know what was that criticism?
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.140]   What was the nature of it?
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   How was it expressed?
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.140]   It would be nice to know.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.860]   And I think this, by the way, this kind of thing is going to be out once the United
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.660]   Nations takes over.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:32.940]   I do wonder if it sounds like Wikipedia maybe isn't, well, I don't know.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:39.220]   I wonder if it's an aggressively sexist environment or just an aggressive environment, which isn't
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.180]   hostile to anybody.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:47.460]   Well, there's no question that the Internet is a sexist environment.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.340]   And hostile and full of trolls.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.060]   And other, yeah.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.860]   But yeah, it's full of trolls, it's full of people who like to criticize and hate for
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.860]   just the sake of it and because anonymity and all of that.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.380]   That's no question.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:11.620]   But specifically about women, we all have a few tech industry actors that are women,
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:16.820]   friends, you know, we have friends that are women, you know, Veronica Belmont and others.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:24.100]   And all of them tell you the same thing and you can see it on the places they interact
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.700]   with people on the web.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.820]   It's horrendous.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.220]   It's terrible.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:34.940]   You have, specifically on the matter of sexism, you have some absolutely unacceptable things
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.020]   that are happening.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:43.620]   You were talking about rape threats and death threats and guys don't have to deal with that.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:52.980]   And I think there's a sort of societally acceptable sexism thing on the Internet.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   The same way that we had maybe at the beginning of last century, societally acceptable anti-Semitism
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.540]   or maybe in the 50s.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.540]   Or racism.
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.540]   Racism.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.580]   But what's different here is it's anonymous.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:10.380]   You feel like that racism went under a rock.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.980]   It wasn't acceptable socially anymore.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.460]   But that it didn't go away.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:20.500]   And now that it can be expressed anonymously, sexism, racism, anti-Semitism are being expressed
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.620]   much more vigorously because people are anonymous.
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:29.700]   Maybe a little bit, but she's talking in her article on TechCrunch about, yeah, it's not
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.220]   even, that's the worst part.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.540]   The anonymous thing everyone has issues with, but it's not even anonymous.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.780]   You know, it's like you'll make a horrible or even snide comment.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.940]   Let's not go into the really outrageous, a snide comment, a comment, you know, a lot
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:49.380]   about some girl who dresses that way or this way or just, and you'll do it.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:54.300]   And if someone is shocked by it, the reaction of most people is going to be, oh, you know,
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   I'm just making fun.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.300]   They're so big.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.300]   Yeah.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.300]   Oh, I was joking.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.300]   I kid.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   I kid.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.100]   And it's like, if you say something about, you know, a black person in the 50s or 60s
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.780]   or about to Jew in Europe in the early 1900s.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:16.660]   And it's, it's, I think, you know, my understanding of this situation and I'm not a girl.
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:22.340]   So I can't, I don't have a very good grasp on this, but on the internet, it's now okay
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.100]   to do these things to girls.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.540]   And it's completely accepted and it's shameful.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:33.980]   It's really something that we have to take a stand on and we have to talk about it.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:41.620]   And we have to change the environment because it leads to real problems for your saying
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.140]   earlier, 49.99% of the population.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.340]   And it's unacceptable.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.900]   It's a law.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.020]   That's kind of the big point is it's a big loss.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.540]   If half the population feels uncomfortable, participating in something.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.540]   Yeah.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:00.300]   And I think, you know, I've seen some studies that show that the same culture goes back
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:06.060]   into the classroom in STEM classes where you have men who came up learning this stuff,
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:11.500]   men who ended up teaching it, you have 80, 90% male classroom.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.540]   You put a woman in there and they very often drop out, especially at the collegiate level.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.060]   They get a few days into this class.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.460]   They don't like the way that people communicate with one another.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.700]   They don't like the way that they're talked to.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.340]   They don't like the way that they're dismissed and they leave and they go over to the other
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:30.260]   kinds of sciences like biology and psychology and some of the softer sciences.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.820]   There's a more equal environment there to learn.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:40.900]   Here's in a related story, an interesting discussion going on.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:46.460]   On the ethics of anonymous apps and secret, I think, has really brought this forward.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:52.420]   Mark Andreessen, Peeam Marka on Twitter started the conversation.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:57.940]   He's lately, he's been, it's really interesting to see him use Twitter with numbered posts.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.500]   He says, "If he doesn't want to write a longer piece, but he ends up writing a longer piece
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:06.380]   at 140 characters at a time, he starts, "I never really like to criticize any startup
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:14.340]   and I won't in this thread by name, but there is an important topic that must be discussed."
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:21.300]   He's asserting that software can condition human behavior.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:26.980]   Software design, how software design deeply influences the human behavior that results.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:33.620]   He says, "There are programs, especially now, that are being created, that encourage negative
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:39.420]   behavior, tearing people down, making fellow souls sad.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:44.740]   Such experiments start out as naughty fun, end with broken hearts and ruined lives,
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.380]   and the end everyone regrets participating in them."
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.220]   Clearly secret is what he's talking about.
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:57.900]   This goes back to the old CompuServe days where you had these groups together and you'd always
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.180]   have these characters that come and you get into these debates and if they ganged up on
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.940]   you, you had all kinds of issues.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.500]   And it happened plenty.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.580]   Women weren't even involved at the time and you had to go through this.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:14.580]   It was like some sort of rights of passage, as a matter of fact, and you'd get criticized
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.620]   ridiculously and told you're an idiot.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:18.980]   It was really horrible.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.980]   And it was really horrible and it was men only, by the way.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.900]   And then the women walked into it later and then they didn't like it.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.220]   Of course, we didn't like it either.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:35.500]   But this is what developed into the bullying meme, "Oh God, you're being bullied."
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:39.100]   And I just go back to the, "Somebody's saying bad things about you.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.780]   They're not coming over and knifing you."
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:46.180]   And it's like the old Sticks and Stones thing that we used to hear when I was a kid.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.980]   It seems like that's been gone by the wayside and everybody's got to be nice to each other.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.500]   I'm just not buying any of this.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.940]   Do you reject the notion and it does sound a little bit like people who say games make
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.500]   you violent.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.220]   The notion that software though can somehow condition your behavior and maybe make you
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.580]   act worse than you would act otherwise or is that, is that not?
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.340]   I know, I think you could bring out the worse in you because there's a different part of
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.340]   the brain.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.740]   There's a different part of the brain at work when you're typing out a message.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.620]   You're saying things that you're not necessarily, writing is different than speaking is a different
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.620]   part of the brain.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:18.620]   It works differently.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:24.140]   And you'll say things in writing that you probably wouldn't say to somebody in person.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.260]   Somebody in the chat room says, "Words hurt, Dvorak."
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.540]   Yeah, if you're 12.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.860]   No, they can.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.940]   And I think, no, I think they can.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.180]   Well, everybody does.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.580]   Apparently thinks they can.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:34.580]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.220]   They don't hurt Sticks and Stones, etc.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.500]   They don't hurt in the same way that Punch and the Nose does.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.500]   Or a knife.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.180]   They can be devastating or a knife.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:51.380]   I mean, there is a difference between a couple of tweets or a few messages on the message
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.660]   board.
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:57.780]   And so I'm going to come back to the question of women.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:09.460]   And the barrage of hate and threats and trolling that women get when they talk about something.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:14.020]   I mean, I don't think it can be quite equated.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.060]   Both are not really the same.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.460]   Maybe I'm not the best person to talk about this.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:24.500]   But especially if a woman, which is the worst, especially if a woman starts talking about
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:29.140]   this specific issue, which makes everything worse.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:37.220]   So get this secret has now changed its algorithm so that when we detect a first name, we display
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:41.700]   a reminder not to defame people.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.700]   That's sweet.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.940]   Now I made that commentary a minute ago into the chat rooms all over me.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.940]   They're being mean to you.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.940]   They're trying to hurt you.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:49.940]   They're giving you a mean word.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.580]   He should quit when he's gone.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.660]   That's great.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.020]   And this is the kind of a holes that are out there.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.980]   And watch these guys go into this.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.420]   It's astonishing to me.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.740]   But this is what happens all the time.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.860]   That's one of the reasons I don't even look at the chat room on no agenda.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:08.180]   But it's like if JCD hit his head on the glass ceiling, his life would be say he wouldn't
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.940]   say such stuff or some to quit your old.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.860]   I mean, this is the biggest.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.860]   You can't.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.540]   So you can't have an opinion anymore because you get shouted down by the masses and usually
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.140]   a masses of a bunch of anonymous jerks.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:27.940]   And I don't want to say the chat room is full with them, but they're in there.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.940]   And they're all over the place.
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:29.940]   We're used to this.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.900]   We are to various degrees personal.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.100]   We are public people.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.100]   It still has still hurt.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:40.580]   And where is this chat room, Maney act that keeps should be kicking all these people off
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.580]   this chat room.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.300]   This chat room is notorious.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.700]   So get these guys off.
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.700]   You see him?
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.700]   You can spot him.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:48.700]   Get him off.
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.700]   I'm all for it.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.700]   There'd be nobody left.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.180]   No, there's one guy saying I'm a good guy.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.180]   Jill speak up.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.180]   Why are you quiet?
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.180]   They say Jill speak up.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.180]   Yeah, I'm not.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.180]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.180]   I'm trying to focus on.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.860]   Don't be in the chat room.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.860]   Trust me.
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:03.860]   It's not worth it.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.860]   But also, you know what?
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.620]   I don't agree with everything that Devorek ever says, but I'm not going to call him.
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.780]   I'm not going to call on ageism here either.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.700]   I think that's just as bad as being sexist.
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:14.700]   Do you use secret?
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.820]   How old you are has nothing to do with what you know.
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.740]   That's what I say.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.140]   Do you secret, Jill?
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.700]   No, no, no, no.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.460]   I think that kind of stuff is just not really for me.
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.660]   I can't resist.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:29.660]   It's a very bad habit.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.660]   It's a very bad habit.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.660]   Anything, let's face it.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.820]   Oh, I have no impulse control.
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:34.820]   None.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:41.580]   But it's like, it's like paparazzo people's magazine, like gossip magazines, right?
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.020]   It feels like a fad too.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.780]   I don't know that it's going to be around for very long.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:52.820]   A lot of what you see on Secret is garbage, like made up stuff, fake leads and so forth.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:57.740]   But it's really, and it's taken Silicon Valley by storm.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.660]   You're better off out of it, I think.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.180]   I'm going to delete it tomorrow.
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.900]   And it's also very--
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.900]   Delete what?
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:05.900]   Very secret.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:06.900]   --secretical and valley centric.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:07.900]   Oh, it is.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:08.900]   It's very Silicon Valley centric.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.820]   But that's partly who's in my address book, right?
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.900]   This is like, this is the F company.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.300]   It's just the new version.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.140]   Oh, that was a great site.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.140]   See?
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.460]   Philip Kaplan, putt.
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.100]   He said, you know, if you could create a site, all the content is generated by the users
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.460]   and you just sit back and collect the money, then you're golden.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.980]   Yeah, it's a slot machine.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:31.220]   It's very-- it's a good way to go.
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.860]   Veronica Mars is back.
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:39.380]   Kristen Bell's TV show, they went to Kickstarter to raise money.
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:40.940]   Some people said, really?
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:45.860]   You need to raise money for a Hollywood movie on Kickstarter, but I think they demonstrated
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:50.380]   there was an audience and the movie has been made.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.300]   Yeah, part of it.
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.300]   I paid the--
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.300]   I predicted it.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.300]   Did you?
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.300]   It's a big show.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.300]   That wraps a movie.
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.300]   Yeah, I love the show.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.940]   And actually, this should be interesting to Jill as well and keep coming back to the women's
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.940]   thing.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.980]   It was one of the first TV shows I saw where there was a strong woman character that was
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:13.220]   not in there, you know, that wasn't there because she was sexy or pretty or anything
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.220]   like that.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.580]   She was a strong female lead and it was well-written, clever.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.460]   It was a teenage show, but still, it was very efficiently made.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.580]   And I was very happy that I could, you know, help Rob Thomas.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.540]   He's the director, the creator.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:27.900]   Yeah, the creator, yeah.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:33.980]   Raised 5.7 million and they made the movie.
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.420]   And then they DRM.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.700]   And then they said, oh, and by the way, we're going to release it on Flixster using ultraviolet.
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:44.260]   And the community went, what the hell?
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.420]   They've backed out.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:49.460]   To their credit, Warner Brothers has backed down and they said, we are going to sell it
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:54.940]   on Amazon and iTunes without, well, actually don't Amazon and iTunes both have DRM?
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:49:01.700]   Yeah, no, they do, but they actually pay you back for the portion, I think, of the Kickstarter
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:06.660]   that you had to pay for that, for the digital download.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.340]   So they give you back 10 bucks, basically.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.340]   But you know, it's good.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:11.340]   It's nice.
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.340]   It's annoying.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:18.780]   If you pay for Kickstarter to get the Veronica Mars movie and they give it to you on Flixster
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:22.420]   with an ultraviolet copy protection, that's a little frustrating.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.420]   Yeah, it is.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.460]   But buyer beware on Kickstarter, frankly.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.460]   I don't.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:30.820]   I always felt a little weird that they raised money for a Hollywood movie.
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.900]   Yeah, it makes no sense.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:35.140]   By going to real people and saying, hey, give us money.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.860]   But the thing is, the movie would not have existed if the Kickstarter campaign hadn't
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:40.860]   been successful.
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.860]   No.
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.660]   And it wasn't the entire amount of money needed to make the movie, not even close, but it's
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:48.660]   told Hollywood, hey, look, there's, you know, there's 20,000 people.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:53.180]   Actually, I'm sorry, 91,000 people were willing to give us actual money to make this movie.
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:56.260]   Same with the Zach Braff's movie, Wish I Was Here.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:01.700]   There was a big, big deal made about the fact that he was even more because he was, he's
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:07.340]   actually a film director who had a successful movie before.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.860]   But you know, I don't see what the big deal is.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:14.220]   If people are willing, people aren't completely idiotic, you know, they know what they're
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:19.140]   getting into, they're willing to give money to the guy to get his film off the ground.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.540]   So they're money.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:25.420]   I mean, I have a Patreon.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.420]   I'm...
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.420]   Do you are using a Patreon?
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.420]   I'm asking for money.
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.420]   For a new show or?
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:35.860]   No, for, I think, you know, for Patreon, it's for Laurent de Wutec.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:39.700]   And I'm very thankful of all the people who are giving money.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:43.180]   But I think it's difficult to do for a new show because I really think you have to have
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:49.540]   a community behind you that trusts and knows you and knows what to expect.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.540]   But there are a lot of people...
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:55.460]   So Patreon, in fact, I think just raised something like $20 million.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:51:00.060]   The idea is very focused on the arts.
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.340]   Although Kickstarter was when it started.
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.940]   The idea that...
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.420]   And what's unique about it is you subscribe, in effect.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:11.380]   So you say, "Not only I'm going to give $5 now, but I'm going to give $5 for every episode."
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:12.380]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.460]   So that's worked out for you.
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:17.300]   Yeah, I mean, obviously it's not...
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:23.100]   I'm in a little bit different situation than others who are using Patreon.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.940]   I do less shows and I'm not...
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:27.740]   It's not my sole income.
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:33.340]   But it's worked out enough that it's a very decent supplemental income.
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:37.860]   So it's really an interesting model because as you were saying, it's sort of a subscription
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:44.740]   and it allows content creators to get reliable, reliable source of revenue, whereas Kickstarter,
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:48.580]   a few people tried to do Kickstarter for different creative projects.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:53.540]   But the problem is you get one big chunk of money to get your thing off the ground.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.540]   It's a one off.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.540]   And then that's it.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:58.700]   And then you don't know what's going to happen in the next...
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.460]   Maybe the next year or whatever.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:01.740]   You have to do it all over again.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.660]   Whereas Patreon has this...
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:06.340]   It's actually Jack Conti from Pomplamoose.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.340]   He's a content creator.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.340]   I love Pomplamoose.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.380]   Yeah, and I'm glad Jack's doing this.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.380]   The only...
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:15.020]   Now, Brushwood told me this because he's raising and has raised money on Patreon.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.220]   Yeah, Tom and Brushwood and Scott Johnson, a bunch of people already want.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:23.180]   What he said is the number is deceptive because you give in a map, but there's also, you could
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.460]   set a limit for how much total you're willing to give.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.100]   So he said the number...
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.500]   The amount you get is actually more like half what you see on the page.
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.260]   Is that your experience?
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.260]   Because...
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.420]   Well, for me, my show is on twice a month.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.580]   So it is a little bit less for the second episode.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.860]   Although I haven't invoiced yet.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.140]   I haven't activated it, but it's just this one.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.500]   So it might end up that I don't get half of what people have promised.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:52.380]   But yeah, for the second episode, people can set a limit and the limit can be equal to
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.300]   what they want to give for the first episode every month.
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:53:01.220]   So in the case of Tom and Brian, they're doing it for court killers and they have four episodes
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.220]   a month.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.220]   So if someone...
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.180]   They have to go through one, two, three, four episodes.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:09.540]   If someone sets a limit to one or two or three, the next one is going to get less money.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.700]   I see a lot of people doing this.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:15.940]   I think it's great because it gives you another choice for monetization and the more you have
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:17.540]   the better, obviously.
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:20.700]   And it allows people who appreciate you.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:25.620]   It's an alternative to advertising in a sense, although it doesn't have to replace it completely.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:30.300]   But it also allows people who enjoy your content enough to support you.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.780]   And there hasn't really been, especially for podcasting, there hasn't really been an
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:38.020]   appropriate way of doing that until now.
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.900]   And I think Patreon might be part of the answer to that for some people.
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:45.300]   And so I'm very happy they're raising money because I'm terrified now that they will go
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.620]   under and take old money away.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.940]   I guess they're not going to, given the number of shows on here and the amount of money these
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.940]   shows are raising.
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:54:00.180]   John is the guy to talk to because no agenda has a very interesting model.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.180]   And it's worked.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:03.180]   Works great.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.180]   You're not using a third party service.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.180]   No, no, no.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.780]   But if we want to use a third party service, we can take a cut.
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:09.780]   8%.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.780]   8%.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.860]   8% is not bad.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:12.860]   It's not good.
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:18.500]   Well, you know, it's interesting because we've tried different podcasters, at least in France,
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:24.180]   have tried models where you would do it yourself, basically just have a bunch of PayPal buttons
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:28.500]   on your website and people could subscribe that way.
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:33.860]   For its work, for some, but maybe not, I don't think as well as it does on this system because
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:38.460]   for some reason, going through that proxy and having them handle the payment and the
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:45.380]   managing of everything, I think people got used to crowd funding in general.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:51.180]   And for some reason, it's easier for people to commit to that kind of thing with a site
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.500]   that can be somewhat equated to kickstarter.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.940]   Do you find that you have to beg for money a lot, John?
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.220]   You spend a lot of time asking for money.
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:02.660]   Here's the problem that people have with podcasts that they want to make a listener supported.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.300]   And I've talked to people about this.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.660]   They have a huge reluctance to ask for money.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.660]   I don't like doing that.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.940]   No, most people don't because they generally, most people are in a position where they used
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:17.100]   to either work for somebody, they're always, they have a, not to say it so bluntly, but
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:21.820]   they have a slave mentality and they feel that they should either be paid by someone
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:27.060]   or they should be subservient to someone and they don't have the wherewithal to take the
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:31.620]   leap of faith and say, look, we, here's the, what we're providing.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.740]   Here's what we need to provide it.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.940]   And we want you to be the person that, that houses do this.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.260]   We're going to do an end around the advertising model and all these other models.
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:46.540]   And the problem that most podcasters have is they cannot do this sincerely.
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:49.220]   They cannot sincerely, they put a button up.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.940]   They say, oh God, God give, yeah, they feel guilty.
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:56.380]   God, maybe if you, if you just, and then, and then they get five bucks and they say, oh,
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:59.540]   just don't ask again because, you know, they already gave us five bucks.
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:05.900]   And it's so, if you're not into it at the right psychological level, you can't be successful.
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.980]   And so falling back on Patreon to me is just a cheap trick.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.980]   It's just like, oh God, well let them do the work and I'll just, just do it.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:13.980]   I don't want to ask.
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:14.980]   I don't want to ask.
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:15.980]   Don't you have to ask.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.980]   Don't you ask on the show?
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:17.980]   I'm going to disagree with you.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:18.980]   I'm going to disagree with you, John.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:22.780]   I, I did ask and it's even, it's maybe a little bit more challenging even in France
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:28.340]   where money is a bit more dirty and you don't really talk about it and you, you shouldn't
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:33.620]   want to be making money because that's what evil capitalist people do.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:38.860]   So I did have to sort of challenge myself to do it, but I did ask for money.
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:45.900]   I, I would like, and I would have to hear what your pitch was to, to evaluate the sincerity
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:46.900]   factor.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.860]   We asked for money in the early days of talking about it.
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:52.540]   You, you wouldn't get, you wouldn't make the money you're making because.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:56.820]   That's the reason I didn't do it because what we didn't, we, we made 10,000 a month or
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.660]   something like that, but, well, that's not bad.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:00.900]   And I wasn't willing to beg.
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:04.100]   I really wasn't, but that wouldn't have supported more than one show a month.
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.660]   And it's not begging, by the way.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.660]   Felt like it.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.940]   Well, I don't think it's begging.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.140]   You weren't doing it right.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.140]   No, I was.
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:15.900]   I would say, you know, if you guys haven't seen Amanda Palmer's TED talk, it's a little
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:16.900]   weird.
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:23.020]   But it's, it's a really wonderful sort of thought experiment about this whole issue of
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.540]   how do you ask for money?
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:29.580]   How do you get people to just support you directly rather than having to have an advertiser or
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:31.500]   a sponsor as the middle man?
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.300]   And it's a, it's a really interesting piece.
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:39.620]   It brought up a lot of stuff for me, especially when she went to the house of the poor people
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:43.060]   and they were sleeping on the floor so she could sleep in their bed.
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.780]   It was like, yeah, I don't know.
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:53.660]   I, you know, she, what's interesting about her is she, before she became a rock star with
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:58.940]   the Dresden dolls, she would stand in a bridal gown on the street corner.
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.340]   She was a statue performer.
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.140]   She was a statue in Boston.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:03.140]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:08.300]   And she would hand out, you know, flour and then people would throw money in the bucket.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:10.220]   So she got very used to asking for money.
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.220]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:12.220]   Something we're not used to.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:14.220]   I mean, I think human, you know, it's not a natural.
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:19.860]   I was, I was on a really interesting panel earlier this week and there were some people
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:24.740]   on it from the advertising end of mobile apps and they were talking about, one guy had a
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:30.660]   point that the best way to incorporate ads or any kind of sponsorship really is to remind
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:32.700]   people with some kind of transparency.
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:35.020]   Look, what we're doing costs money to put on.
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:36.180]   Yeah, we do that all the time.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:42.220]   We need to make the funds like, and just that little bit of human touch to say, we want
[00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:45.060]   you to know that this is the way that it works.
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:47.500]   So please listen to our wonderful sponsor.
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.020]   It goes a long way.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.940]   That's just being honest.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:54.260]   Right now this week is the KQED's got all these guys coming on.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.260]   Yes, I hate.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.900]   Well, this I hate.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:00.060]   You're sitting there, you're watching a perfectly good piece on Pete Seger.
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:04.460]   And then all of a sudden they stop and some bozo spends two bozos in this case, two bozos
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:05.580]   saying, give us money.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:06.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:07.580]   This I hate.
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:08.580]   Okay.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:10.300]   You start, so you stop listening to KQED as a protest?
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.300]   Yes.
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:15.900]   During pledge week, the rest of the time I watch.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.940]   So you're just essentially a taker.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:18.940]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.860]   They get plenty of money from the Koch brothers.
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:22.620]   I'm not worried about them.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.060]   Curiously, they do get plenty of money.
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.060]   I know they do.
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:30.340]   They used to get money from the Gates Foundation, but Bill and Melinda decided the show was
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:31.340]   boring.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:32.340]   You know about this.
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.340]   You're talking about McNeil Larrar, Newshower?
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.860]   Well, the news hour is not McNeil Larrar anymore.
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.020]   No, but you know what's interesting?
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.500]   McNeil Larrar still own it.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.500]   No, I know that.
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.500]   It's called the news hour.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:45.900]   So the Gates Foundation said, or Bill, or Melinda, I think it was Melinda, she said,
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:47.060]   "This show sucks.
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.060]   It's boring.
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:49.460]   Can't you jazz it up a little bit?
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.700]   We're some colorful clothes."
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:51.700]   No, it's a PBS.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:56.380]   They pulled their money and PBS had a big meeting and they said, "Okay, we're going
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.380]   to fix the show."
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:01.540]   And when it gets back to your status, when you're satisfied, will you give us some money?
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.540]   They have yet to come back.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.540]   No.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.740]   But they have jazzed up the show.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.780]   Anyway, the little story that nobody cares about.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:14.140]   I feel like I like our model.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:18.780]   But I think that what I do like is that there are many models and whatever, the more models
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.340]   we can't do.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:25.060]   I don't believe a uncorruptible news show can be done with your model.
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.060]   Right, no, I agree.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.860]   We're so corrupted.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:32.980]   Well, you're not that corrupted, but you're corrupted because you're take advertising.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.180]   You're not going to say anything bad about the advertisers.
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.540]   Well, why would you?
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.580]   My original plan was not to take advertising for that very reason.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:44.860]   Not so much that I felt it would corrupt us, but that I wanted to be above a suspicion.
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:45.860]   Right.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.340]   But nobody cares that much about it in general.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.020]   But if we're going to do the kind of show that we--
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.940]   Your show, which is scurrilous.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.020]   We have a lot of insulting things to say.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.020]   And I would say that we would--
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.020]   You couldn't do it.
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.020]   We couldn't do it.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.620]   We get-- it's happened with you.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.220]   Every once in a while, you have some jerk on one of your shows who says something.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.820]   And I can see your cringe.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:13.740]   Actually, Brian Brushwood and Justin Robert Young took NSFW off our network and are trying
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:20.580]   to support it through the Patreon model because they wanted to be able to be nasty.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.580]   And I wouldn't let them be nasty.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.580]   Right.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.580]   Which is fine.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.580]   Some advertisers say that you're nasty, but you're nasty, that show hasn't.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.580]   I don't see why that show has to be--
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:31.140]   I don't see why they have to be nasty on that show.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.140]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.500]   Well, it's cool not safe for work.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.020]   Well, that was my mistake.
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.020]   Oh, that's--
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.020]   I should have let--
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.020]   I suggest that--
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.020]   That was my mistake.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.020]   Point, well taken.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:44.300]   But they don't have-- yeah, they had ads on when they were on our network, but they
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:49.340]   really didn't want to have to, you know, in any way modify their conversation.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.780]   Well, they would just talk dirty, I think, right?
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.780]   Dirty, yeah.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.780]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:02:01.820]   I think it's-- I mean, for a show where you take an ad model, if you grow enough, you're
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:07.900]   going to be making a lot more money than you will on a-- I think that then you would
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.660]   on a crowd-funded show.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:16.380]   So it is a little bit different, and every show is different, and every show is special
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.380]   and wonderful.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.860]   But there are different factors to take into consideration.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:27.380]   I don't think Patreon is going to be supporting shows enough that they-- that you could have
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:30.460]   grown Leo, your operation into what it is today.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.380]   We built a million and a half dollar studio.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.380]   That's not going to happen.
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.380]   Exactly.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:38.900]   From donations, yet we did raise $250,000 of that from selling bricks.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.380]   I bought a brick.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.380]   I know.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.380]   I like the bricks.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.380]   I like the bricks.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.380]   You know what in bricks?
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.380]   Huh?
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.380]   What?
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.380]   I like bricks.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.380]   No, what?
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.380]   What about them?
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.380]   What's in them?
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.380]   How many?
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:53.380]   You know those bricks--
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.380]   You said 150?
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.380]   250,000.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.380]   250,000 in bricks.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.380]   1,800 bricks.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.380]   Good.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.380]   And you're not getting that money back.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.380]   I want my money back.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.380]   And I said, well, okay.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.380]   You bought a brick.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.380]   You bought a brick.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.900]   I can't really take it out of the wall.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.580]   But I said, I'll be glad to send you my money.
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.580]   Your money back.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.580]   No, they bought the brick.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.180]   You buy a brick and buy a brick.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.180]   It's not like something you could return.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:16.980]   Well, then somebody else said, well, I'll take his brick.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.980]   But I don't know how I would do--
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:18.980]   Can you have somebody take a brick that's--
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.980]   I'd have to--
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:20.980]   I'd have to chisel out the name.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.980]   No, no, no.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.980]   No, no, no.
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:23.980]   No, bricks are brick.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:24.980]   You're done.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.980]   You bought a brick.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.980]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:27.980]   It's not about begging.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:31.580]   It's about asking people if you think it's valuable, then I'll take a couple of dollars
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:32.580]   if they have them to spare.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:36.780]   We really wanted to sell naming rights to the studio, you know, like a ball.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.780]   Like, Paul Parks.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.780]   Now you're talking.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:41.180]   You might as well go to the Patrick Bezier room.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:46.180]   Did you feel like, would that be weird if we didn't have the money back?
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:49.180]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:51.180]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.180]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.180]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.180]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.180]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.180]   Make it an auction.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.980]   Would you feel like, would that be weird if we did that?
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:00.980]   And now from...
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:01.980]   I'll take that Duffy table right there.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.980]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:07.780]   And now the Jill Duffy Memorial Studio in beautiful downtown Petaluma, California.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.580]   You're a memorialized?
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.580]   Well, you know.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.780]   You don't have to be dead.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.880]   That's the way they do it on network TV.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.780]   And now from the SO studio.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.580]   They do that and they also say, and this sports update is brought to you by.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.580]   I don't like doing that.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:26.180]   And they say five sports scores and Samsung paid for it.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.380]   You couldn't get anybody to do that.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.380]   Nobody wanted to buy it.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.380]   You needed to set up some sort of a buzz.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.380]   Here we are from Citibank Studio.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.380]   A buzz and an auction.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:40.180]   The problem with an auction, like if you get a bid for a buck and no one else bids over
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.380]   that, you got to sell it for a buck?
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.780]   No, somebody would bid two.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.780]   I'd bid two.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.780]   Two bucks?
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.780]   Then we got two bucks.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.780]   Okay, bid four.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.380]   And for the rest of my life, I have to call it the John C. Devore Act Memorial Studio.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.780]   No, you do like to do it with the stadiums.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.380]   You do it for a one year contract.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:53.380]   Oh, one year.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.380]   Yeah, one year.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:57.780]   And it makes it look like you're moving around.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.380]   I was afraid Jason Kellecanis would buy the naming rights.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.060]   That's actually what happened.
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.060]   He would too.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.620]   He'd give me a million bucks just so I'd have to say.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.380]   Now from the Jason Kellecanis studios.
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.380]   Yeah, he would.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.380]   He would do that.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.380]   Well, I don't see you.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.380]   We wouldn't do it for a million, but he'd do it for some reason.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:15.660]   I showed today brought to you by Go to a meeting from Citrix.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.900]   The great way to meet.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.700]   Not all your meetings can be planned in advance.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:20.700]   Things come up.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.060]   Things can be very important to cut through the knot.
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.380]   We have a three emailing out policy.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:28.580]   If three emails go back and forth over a topic, we call a meeting.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.100]   We say, no, no, no, this isn't going to work.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.020]   Let's get all the parties to the table.
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.220]   But sometimes the parties are all over the place.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.780]   That's where Go to meetings fabulous.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.060]   People working in different offices on the go around the world can get together to solve
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:44.060]   problems, to discuss ideas.
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:46.940]   I just think this is such a great tool for business.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:49.860]   Go to meeting from Citrix.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.620]   We and collaborate online.
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:53.860]   You're seeing each other's screens so you're on the same page.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.020]   You can see each other face to face.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.020]   You get eye to eye.
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.380]   You can sign up for Go to meeting from your computer or your mobile device and launch
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.540]   your first meeting in seconds.

[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:29.660]   Here's the part where I say and we thank Go to meeting so much for their support of this
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:33.420]   week in tech without whom this show would not be possible.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.900]   Why did you bring my bobble head?
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:36.900]   We sold these two.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:42.060]   This was not a great money maker.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.900]   See I'm really not that embarrassed I guess to ask for money.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.900]   No.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.940]   Actually, these are nice though.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.700]   See solid resin?
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.660]   This is not some cheap bobble head.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.420]   I think this is one of the best products you've sold.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.700]   It doesn't look like you though.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:55.700]   It looks like...
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.940]   Well, no bobble head ever looks like anybody.
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.940]   Right?
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.580]   Except for the head part we're going to learn about.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.460]   This is based on pictures, 3D models from pictures.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.740]   But just nothing it never looks like anybody.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:09.260]   That looks sort of like me.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.260]   No.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.260]   No.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.540]   Did you see President Obama between the ferns?
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.540]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.540]   I did, yeah.
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.540]   Great stuff.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.020]   It's very funny.
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:27.540]   I like Zachalaphimachus, but I'm amazed that President Obama would cooperate on that.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:28.540]   I was stunned.
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.420]   It's good politics.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:31.420]   You think?
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.420]   Well, we've come a long way.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.260]   Remember when it was a big deal and Bill Clinton came on the Leno show and played his
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.260]   saxophone?
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.260]   That was a big deal.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.260]   It was.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.260]   And now, you know...
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.260]   Now they're doing stand up.
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.700]   You have to stand up on the Internet show.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.860]   I'm not even going to be honest about it.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:46.940]   I didn't like it.
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:47.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:48.940]   Well, the difference...
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.940]   Sorry.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.860]   Would a French president have done that?
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:58.420]   Well, you know, our French president was caught on a scooter going to his lover's house.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.420]   Because he was wearing business shoes.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.420]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:04.420]   That's what gave it away.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:10.020]   But no, I mean, the difference between the Bill Clinton thing and the Obama thing was
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:14.580]   that he actually went there to promote the healthcare...
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.580]   Yeah, he felt his...
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.340]   This is how you get to young people.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:19.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:21.860]   And it was incredibly efficient.
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:22.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:24.860]   So you can argue...
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:27.660]   I mean, no, I guess a lot of people were arguing.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:31.100]   He should be doing serious stuff and not this Internet thing.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:35.140]   But you know, actually, he made something very efficient.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.140]   Oh, where the man's are?
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.020]   He managed to inform...
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.020]   Who signed up?
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:40.420]   How efficient was it?
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:41.420]   I don't know.
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.420]   No, they say they...
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.780]   No, kids at all have signed up for healthcare.
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:45.780]   And they're...
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:46.780]   For good reason.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:49.380]   Because they're immortal as we all know.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:50.380]   That's a different topic.
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:55.700]   But there was the bulk of the healthcare.gov traffic.
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.340]   Apparently, he is now coming from Funny or Die.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:08:59.340]   So...
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.340]   Nixon, somebody...
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.340]   Jackie's pointing out Nixon.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.340]   Nixon.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.340]   He was on laughing.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.340]   Remember he went to college.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.340]   From me?
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:07.340]   From me?
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.340]   Sock it to me.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.180]   I guess there's a long-standing tradition.
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.340]   Nixon was the first TV president, though.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:17.300]   He had admin running his campaign and so forth.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.300]   In the...
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.300]   Not in '60, in '68.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.300]   I guess.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.300]   You can look it up.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.300]   Okay, I'll look it up.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.300]   How's it going?
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.300]   It's his?
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:27.300]   They don't lie on the Internet.
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:28.300]   They don't lie on the Internet.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.300]   I'll look it up on Wikipedia.
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.500]   Ken from Chicago is saying that there was a surge of enrollment on healthcare.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.500]   There you go.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.580]   Because the president was cool and hip.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.580]   And I don't want...
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.580]   No spoilers.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.740]   You can actually have a spoiler on between the ferns, believe it or not.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.100]   But the ending is great.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.100]   I thought.
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.100]   Very funny.
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:45.100]   Okay.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:49.300]   It was a good ending.
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.300]   iOS...
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.300]   iOS...
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.820]   Oh, say let's talk about South by Southwest.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:55.340]   Did Jill, did you go to South by?
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.340]   No.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.340]   You know what?
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:02.820]   I went two years ago and after that event I said I'm not going anymore.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:03.820]   Why?
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:10.980]   It's too discombobulated and I think it's still really best for people who are there
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:15.060]   for the music and the entertainment and for the technology angle.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.060]   CES was really plenty.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.820]   I did not need to be at South by Southwest.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:21.820]   And you were there?
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.820]   Oh yeah.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.820]   Oh yeah.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.820]   You lie.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:25.820]   No.
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:26.820]   You went to South by?
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:27.820]   You could look at my Twitter feed.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:28.820]   You'll find that I was there.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.820]   Oh, you just tweeted it.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.820]   That's appropriate because it's really just...
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:32.820]   Some people saw me.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:34.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:35.820]   Very sad story.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.820]   A driver plouted into a crowd at a block of a street with that six-trader.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.820]   Yeah, it was a six-trader.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:43.820]   The car goes down the street.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:44.820]   Two people died.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.820]   Terrible.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:46.820]   It was terrible.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.940]   23 people injured.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.500]   He's being charged with a capital crime as he should be.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:56.180]   No, it's because everybody there's drunk.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.180]   It's a drunk fest.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:59.540]   It is and it's a party drunk fest.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.500]   That was one reason I enjoyed Secret.
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:05.980]   Everything South by Southwest, a lot of people going drunk is out.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:11.220]   And that people were posting selfies of themselves plastered is not a good idea.
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:16.260]   Ladies Gaga, the Snowden thing at South by Southwest.
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.300]   Yeah, so there was some news.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:22.180]   Julian Assange did a Skype interview which failed.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:26.500]   And a couple of days later Edward Snowden, instead of using Skype, used Google Hangouts
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.500]   because they're so much more trustworthy.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.620]   And it was a very poor frame rate, but he was apparently, I don't know if it was serious,
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.580]   they joked, he was on seven proxies.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.940]   I think he was using Tor to get there.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:39.940]   Why?
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.940]   They know where he is.
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:41.940]   No, they don't.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.940]   He's in Russia.
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:46.380]   Oh yeah, our intelligence agencies have no clue where he is.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.380]   That's the irony of break.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.260]   They're all of this NSA stuff.
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.620]   I think they actually don't.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:54.860]   They can't find a triple seven airplane.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:59.060]   If they put Snowden in it, they probably could find it.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:05.500]   Okay, I want to say something about Snowden.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.060]   And I want to hear your thoughts on this.
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:08.700]   Please don't say he should be shot.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:12.020]   You had somebody on your show saying he should.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.620]   Wasn't my show TNT.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.660]   Yeah, sorry about that.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.460]   I apologize to all of Sundry.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:25.580]   So actually it's not about him getting shot or whether he should be shot.
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.580]   It's the opposite.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.260]   I think a lot of us have been.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:31.500]   I don't know if you've listened, if you've actually listened to this interview and there's
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.740]   been a couple of others.
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:45.300]   And he is incredibly soft spoken and well spoken and very precise about what he wants
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:53.140]   and what he wanted to achieve with his leaks and the care he took and not making it too
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.060]   damaging.
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:13:02.820]   And the way he approaches the whole problem shows how much it's not about.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:03.860]   You were talking about Assange.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:10.540]   I think Assange is a lot more controversial in the sense that he's very much of his own
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.540]   personality.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:15.460]   And you can feel that there is a lot of him in what he does.
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.220]   Snowden feels very different.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.340]   And I think that by now it's been a few months.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.540]   I can't remember how many.
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.540]   June.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.340]   Eight months.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.940]   So eight months since then.
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:33.740]   And a lot of us have been incredibly careful in how we were judging this whole affair because
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.740]   we didn't really know enough.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:41.780]   And the dust was still settling and we didn't know what the NSA did, what Snowden was after,
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.060]   what we knew, what we didn't know.
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:49.900]   Now I think that we're in a point unless there's something incredibly surprising that happens,
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.060]   which is always possible.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:58.300]   Now the dust has settled and I think we can decide which side of this argument we're on.
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:07.740]   And for my money, I think it's okay to say that Snowden is a hero and he's an American
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:10.620]   hero and he's an international hero.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:16.420]   And he did something incredibly dangerous, not for his own sake, but because he was witnessing
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:25.220]   as he says, the constitution of the US being broken left right in Sunday.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:27.060]   I can't remember how you say this.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:35.300]   But we've seen how the NSA has been lying to Congress.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:39.900]   And anyway, I'm not going to go back through everything that we've witnessed in the past
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:40.900]   eight months.
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:47.300]   And I just want to say it's okay now to decide whether or not we want to say that he's a
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.300]   hero.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.300]   I think he is.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.460]   And I think a lot of the people from the tech community should be taking a stand on
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.260]   this.
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:58.380]   And now we know it's not okay anymore to say, well, you know, we're not sure it's still
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.380]   unclear.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.380]   We're waiting to find out more.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:01.380]   Now we know more.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:08.220]   Boy, the things we're learning, this week the revelation was about quantum, a tool that
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:15.060]   weaponized the internet in effect by allowing the NSA to automate the infection of as millions
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:20.460]   of computers with malware, malware that could be used to turn on the camera and take pictures,
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:23.140]   turn on the sound and listen in.
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:24.140]   It's never ending.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.140]   It's one story.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:26.140]   No, you never end.
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.140]   It's never.
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:28.140]   That's what's funny about it.
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:31.500]   You would think after six months, it would be like, okay, now it's done, but it keeps on
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.940]   coming all the time.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:39.180]   And it is to a point where it's clear, at least to me again, I want to qualify this a little
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:46.100]   bit, but it seems very clear that the NSA and possibly some parts of the government
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:52.060]   is breaking the, I hesitate to say the law because they've actually arranged the law so
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:57.540]   they wouldn't be breaking it doing these outrageous things, but is going beyond the scope of what
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:01.580]   they is acceptable and what they should be allowed to do.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:04.140]   And that for me settles it.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:10.420]   It's clear someone had to blow the whistle and he did and he should be commended for it.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:19.500]   The NSA and Britain's GCHQ wanted to add "Pone by Keyword" feature to quantum.
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:25.580]   If a user's email through Yahoo or Hotmail contained any keywords that were offensive,
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:29.700]   like I don't know, hummus, it would exploit them automatically.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.700]   Nice.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.020]   It would just go, oh, good, we got him.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.100]   Hummus eater.
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:40.900]   There are some questions about how well this might have worked, but the point that they
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:44.140]   wanted to do that is sufficient for the conversation.
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:51.500]   Yeah, what they're really looking at, believe me as words like merger, acquisition, seriously.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:56.500]   This is a black mailing operation and it's also a scheme to make money with the center
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.500]   trading.
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.500]   Really?
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.500]   That's what you think.
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:03.100]   You don't think that they're actually just trying to find terrorists to protect the United
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.100]   States?
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:07.220]   They're trying to find stock tips that nobody else has access to.
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.220]   There's all these laws, by the way.
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.140]   Either way, it's not acceptable, is it?
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.140]   No, it's not.
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.140]   Of course not.
[01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.140]   I could live with it if they were...
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.940]   If I had the stock tip, I could live with it.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:24.580]   If it were appropriately circumscribed by law and they were doing it to attack an individual
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.940]   who was deemed a threat to the United States.
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.060]   But that's kind of retail.
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:30.060]   That's kind of retail.
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:31.700]   It looks like they're doing an wholesale.
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.340]   It's kind of automatically.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:34.340]   That's the whole point.
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.340]   That's even...
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:38.780]   When I say Snowden is very precise in what he wants, it's exactly what he's saying.
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:43.980]   He's not saying we should stop spying on everyone or he's not a privacy nut.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:47.220]   He's not saying that should never be possible about anything.
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.220]   We should neuter the NSA.
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.380]   That's not what he's saying.
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:53.020]   He's saying we should absolutely pursue valid targets.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:55.660]   We should have tools to fight terrorism.
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.900]   It's just the mass surveillance is unacceptable.
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.740]   That's exactly what you're saying, Leo.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:08.500]   It should be okay for these organizations to have these tools and to use them in a targeted
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.500]   manner.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.500]   That's...
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.500]   We're not against spying.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   God knows.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.660]   I'm very much for that.
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:14.660]   Right.
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.660]   For these kinds of things.
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:17.420]   There's also the larger issue.
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:21.380]   Michael Haponin of F-Protect, the Finnish security legend.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.020]   He's been around for a long time.
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:29.100]   When you introduce this malware in computers, you also introduce vulnerabilities that other
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.740]   malicious agents can avoid.
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:31.740]   Yeah, the mob.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.900]   So you really...
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:35.020]   This is really breaking things badly.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:38.100]   There's nothing worse than malware.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.100]   Nothing.
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.820]   What do you guys think about this?
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.820]   Nothing.
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:44.420]   About my huge rant.
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.420]   Am I wrong?
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.580]   Yeah, you're fine with the rant.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.380]   No, I think it's time to say.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:52.900]   I think it's safe to say that this...
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:19:00.700]   You can talk about technicalities like, "Well, he made an oath that he wouldn't ever reveal
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.340]   this stuff and he'd tell it."
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:04.540]   No agenda thesis is on this, right?
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:07.180]   I can figure it's the panopticon.
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.460]   The no agenda thesis is that Snowden...
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:12.540]   He said this in the interview he did with the German TV guys.
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.940]   He said he still works for the CIA.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:19.500]   This is the CIA's attempt to cut the budget because they get all the money he's going
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.500]   to the NSA.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.900]   And there's a battle going on between these two agencies.
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.220]   He said, "Well, he told German television, "I still work for the CIA."
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.700]   He basically did, yes.
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:28.700]   Really?
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.700]   Did you ever see that interview?
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:31.020]   No, he said he was involved in Bitcoin.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:34.340]   He says he still has his ID and as far as he's...
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.620]   Technically, I still work.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.620]   They never fired me.
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:38.260]   Of course not.
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.780]   And he kept calling what he did a mission.
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:42.780]   I'm telling you, you should...
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:44.780]   Why would he admit it?
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.780]   To German TV?
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.500]   Did that even run in the United States?
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:51.100]   They do three hours and that one word of it runs in the United States.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.100]   Because it's in German.
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.060]   No, it was all in English.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.500]   That's okay.
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:20:00.260]   Just listen to no agenda and you won't have to listen to Leo's theories.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.900]   Which is that everything's fine.
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.900]   It's fine.
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:03.900]   Everything's fine.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.900]   There's a wonderful word.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.900]   The words are good.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:06.900]   The NSA are great guys.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.900]   The dreams of great...
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.900]   And nobody's doing any of this.
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.900]   Those guys too.
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:11.900]   There you go.
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:12.900]   Now you're talking.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.900]   Wonderful word.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:15.900]   This would be...
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.620]   Jill, I'm sorry you had to be here for this episode.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.220]   I didn't bring this topic up.
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.220]   I know I did.
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:22.220]   I'm trying to find...
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:24.100]   Desperately trying to find news.
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.060]   We will come back and find some news.
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.540]   There's tons of news.
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:28.540]   Good.
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:29.540]   Would you...
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:30.540]   Get a story prepared.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.540]   Get a story prepared.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.540]   Locked and loaded.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.020]   I was as great about it.
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:36.860]   As they say in the firearm game.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:37.940]   Do they?
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:41.740]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com with over 30 million.
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:43.620]   Actually, if you go to Shutterstock, I like doing this.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:48.220]   You can see how many totally got right now because they keep an actual account on the
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:49.220]   site.
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:59.860]   There are, ladies and gentlemen, 34,793,373 royalty-free stock images right now on Shutterstock.com.
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:02.940]   This week they added more than a quarter million new images.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.340]   All of them curated, carefully selected for quality.
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.340]   That's just the photos.
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:11.700]   If you click the footage tab at Shutterstock.com, you'll see that there are well over 1.5 million
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:19.140]   point six million stock-free videos, royalty-free stock videos.
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:21.460]   Just a great selection of stuff.
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.860]   22,000 new videos this week.
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:29.300]   Now you might say, "Well, with that variety, Leo, how am I going to find what I need?
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.300]   Give me a noun."
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.300]   A noun?
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.300]   Yeah, a noun.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.300]   Any noun.
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:34.300]   A cup.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:35.300]   A surfboard.
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:36.300]   A surfboard.
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:38.300]   I like hers better.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.300]   All right.
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:44.300]   I'll show you why.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:49.300]   Now, give me an adjective because you can search.
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:50.300]   You can search.
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.300]   Whatever she says is gold.
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.300]   That's right.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:54.300]   Because I have a bias.
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.300]   Bias.
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.300]   I don't know.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:59.300]   Glossy surfboards.
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:00.300]   I think these are glossy photos of surfboards.
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:01.300]   I'm not sure.
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:02.300]   Now these are like logos you put on surfboards.
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.300]   That's pretty glossy.
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:04.820]   So here's the beauty of this.
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:05.820]   You can search for nouns.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.100]   You can search for adjectives.
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:10.100]   You can narrow it down by color.
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:11.100]   They have a color wheel.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:15.460]   You can actually say, "You know, our page, we really focus on the Royal Blues."
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:18.420]   So let me search for Royal Blue Glossy Surfboard.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:21.340]   Oh, there are no Royal Blue Glossy surfboards.
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:22.340]   You went the wrong way.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.580]   You should have gone with a cup.
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:24.580]   A cup?
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:25.580]   I would have found one.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:26.580]   So here's the deal.
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:28.260]   I want you to sign up for your free account.
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:29.620]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:34.220]   What you will be able to do with the free account is get free photo and vector images
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:35.220]   each week.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.660]   Yours for the taking.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.940]   You'll also get access to the light boxes.
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:44.860]   That's nice because you can find an image, save the image, and then share it with colleagues,
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.300]   use it later.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.900]   You don't have to buy it right away if you do decide to buy.
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.940]   Yeah, by the way, they have editorial as well as stock photos.
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:53.660]   You need a good picture of Bill Gates.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:54.660]   They got it.
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:57.460]   The Pope, you got it.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:01.540]   Albert Einstein, you got it.
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:04.460]   Miley Cyrus, you got it.
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:07.300]   It's all there at Shutterstock.com.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.500]   We have the 25-- yeah, there's the picture of Miley you want.
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:15.780]   We have the 25-- 25 image a day subscription.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:18.180]   This is great for publications.
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:21.540]   You never run out of great content you could use.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:25.540]   Shutterstock.com, check out their apps on iOS and Android.
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.060]   Beautiful Webby Award-winning app.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:34.060]   If you decide to buy, I invite you to use our offer code, "Twit 314," because then you
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:37.660]   will get 20% off new accounts.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.140]   That's "Twit 314."
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:41.140]   Do not use the number "Pye."
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:42.140]   You might be tempted.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.820]   You might say, "Twit 314."
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:47.260]   Maybe it's "Twit 314"-- "314159" and all and all.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.460]   But now it's not "Pye."
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:51.220]   It's March 14th or March 2014.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.220]   Okay.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:57.580]   So just-- I mean, sometimes people are tempted to use irrational numbers in the offer codes.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:58.580]   Never but this.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:00.580]   Do not.
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:01.580]   Use real numbers, please.
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.380]   Mm, somebody said, "Mm, Pie."
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:08.180]   "Twit 314 at Shutterstock.com for 20% off."
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.660]   Did you celebrate "Pye" date?
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:10.660]   No.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:13.020]   I had a lot of fun on Twitter.
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:16.220]   I started posting mnemonics for "Pye."
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:17.580]   And people thought I was crazy.
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.740]   I wonder why they think that.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:24.420]   Oh, how I want to drink alcoholic, of course, after the heavy chapters involving quantum
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:25.420]   mechanics.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.420]   All right.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.740]   So let's get some stories that you just wanted me to do.
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:29.740]   You wanted some, right?
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:30.940]   You found some good stories.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:34.340]   Government computers running XP will be vulnerable to hackers after April 8th.
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:36.980]   I wrote a column about this in the PC magazine.
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:37.980]   Hackers.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:38.980]   Who?
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:39.980]   Everybody.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:43.420]   That Microsoft should charge a little-- give a certain-- there's half a million.
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:44.420]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.420]   Half a billion.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.340]   Half a billion XP machines out there.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:52.860]   If they charge the dollar a month for support, they could easily make about $3 to $6 billion
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.620]   extra on the bottom line.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:55.620]   And just support this thing.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.940]   They already got a group in play that supports it.
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:00.460]   Why don't you just keep them in business?
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.140]   So that's my argument about XP.
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.140]   Because then nobody would ever buy Windows 8.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.140]   No, no, no.
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.140]   These are things that are stuck in place.
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:08.780]   They're on ATM machines, banks use XP.
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:09.780]   There's a bunch of people.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:10.780]   They don't want to--
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:12.940]   95% of all ATMs in the US are using Windows XP.
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:13.940]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:16.380]   So supported.
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:17.380]   Are you, you know, are you--
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:21.180]   You want your bank to change the software and their ATM machines, really?
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.180]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:23.180]   That Windows 8.
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.180]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:25.780]   All right, you're right.
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:27.900]   They should have never used Windows to begin with.
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.340]   Well, there's that.
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:31.580]   But wow.
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.300]   We-- Steve Gibson said it's fine.
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.340]   Go ahead and use Windows XP.
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:36.340]   He says safe.
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.340]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.340]   Really?
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:39.340]   Yeah, I agree with Steve.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.340]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:41.980]   Didn't you just say--
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:42.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:43.980]   No, they still need support because there's--
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.980]   I'm getting whiplash.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:46.780]   I can't follow it at all.
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:47.980]   Well, this is not--
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:48.980]   How about BOS?
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:50.860]   How do you feel about BOS?
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:52.660]   Whatever happened to BOS?
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:53.660]   They dropped it all.
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:54.660]   They came--
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:55.660]   They dropped it all.
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:56.660]   It became BS.
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:57.660]   That's the real problem.
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:25:59.660]   They came this close.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:02.980]   Apple was looking at them, looking closely because BOS came with the great John Louis
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:06.420]   Gasey, former Apple Vice President.
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:11.420]   And then they had this other thing, the next operating system, next step, and some guy
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.780]   named Steve Jobs, and they were-- it was BOS next, BOS.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:15.780]   They finally got next.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:22.300]   I remember Steve BOS in Paris obviously a very long time ago, and I was completely
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:28.100]   amazed that it could read two video feeds from the hard drive at the same time.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.780]   It was revolutionary.
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:31.700]   It was incredible.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.200]   Boom.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.340]   So Intel's going to 14 nanometers.
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:36.340]   Really?
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:37.340]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:41.100]   Don't you remember about five years ago when you couldn't do-- you know, you go, oh, you
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.100]   can't do it.
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:45.260]   You're going to have to need X-rays and all this other stuff, and they keep doing it.
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.020]   I'm pretty sure you run out of nanos.
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.020]   Well--
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.020]   I mean, 14.
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.020]   14.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.620]   That's 14 billions.
[01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:56.220]   22 is the current-- 22 is the current process.
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.220]   14.
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:59.220]   Wow.
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:07.260]   I mean, you can't-- at this point, you're getting the point where you're in quantum
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:08.260]   effects.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:10.300]   I don't know how they can do it.
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.980]   Maybe they're just lying to us.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:15.860]   Are they still using electron beam lithography, or what are they using?
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:16.860]   I don't know.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.100]   I'm going to have to catch up with this.
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:20.860]   I fell behind because nobody writes about this stuff anymore.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:21.860]   You know what no one does?
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:22.860]   Nobody cares anymore.
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:23.860]   No.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:24.860]   We care.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:25.860]   We do.
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:26.860]   We have a whole lot.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:27.860]   We have institutional memory.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:28.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:33.540]   Plasma damage to low-k materials can really get in the way if you know what you're talking
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:34.540]   about with this process.
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:35.540]   No.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.540]   I don't know anything.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:37.540]   Process.
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:38.540]   Problems.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.540]   Wow.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:40.620]   I didn't know that.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:42.020]   That is a good story.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.020]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:47.620]   Of course, it's in seeking alpha.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:51.020]   IBM denies giving client data to the US government.
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:53.060]   IBM was never mentioned in any of these scandals.
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.660]   Nobody ever asked them.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:59.460]   What do we want their client data for?
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:02.460]   We want to do it.
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.460]   Go ahead and ask.
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:05.460]   We won't do it.
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:07.260]   IBM's Watson is now doing recipes.
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.820]   This is a bizarre story.
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:11.780]   So Watson was the Jeopardy playing computer.
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:12.780]   Right.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:14.740]   Now it's scam by the way.
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:15.740]   Yeah.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:16.740]   Yeah, it was a scam.
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.340]   It was a little guy in the machine.
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:22.260]   No, it's because they could hit the button faster than any, but then any more.
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:23.260]   Right.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.260]   That's the game, by the way.
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:25.260]   Yeah.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:26.260]   The game is how?
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.260]   It's nothing to do with a question and answer.
[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.260]   Everyone can answer the questions.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:29.260]   Boom.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.260]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.260]   They all can answer.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.260]   It's how it's timing.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:36.060]   So what's that like for the first few questions and then the other contestants complained and
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:43.340]   then they had to implement a timer that would make it Watson push the button in a humanly
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:44.340]   realistic time.
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:45.340]   Well, that's right.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.740]   Maybe everybody.
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:50.180]   So what is Watson cooking?
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:53.020]   Apparently Watson is.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.500]   I don't know.
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:58.380]   I just read about it being is now doing recipes or something.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:01.860]   And I can't imagine how this.
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:10.780]   It analyzed the system analyzed according to the Verge 35,000 recipes and about 1000 chemical
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:15.940]   flavor compounds so it can make educated guesses about which ingredient combinations
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:20.500]   will delight and surprise humans.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.500]   Humon.
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.500]   Humon must eat food.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.500]   Drives this.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.500]   Humon.
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.100]   Surprise, I'm sure, is easy to achieve.
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.100]   Wow.
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.100]   Wow.
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.340]   I didn't expect that.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:35.300]   Why am I getting a banana sauce on my sirloin steak?
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:47.180]   Friday at South by Southwest IBM had a fire engine red food truck with a meal plan generated
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:53.100]   by Watson, including such surprising and delightful treats as chocolate burritos.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.660]   No.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:57.420]   And Swiss Thai asparagus.
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:59.420]   Kish.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:03.700]   Did people have to pay to eat this food?
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.740]   Humans made it.
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:05.740]   Humon.
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.900]   Creole shrimp lamb dumpling.
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:11.980]   Baltic apple pie and Turkish bruschetta.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:12.980]   Turkish bruschetta.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:14.980]   What is what is that?
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:17.780]   Only Watson knows.
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:21.180]   See now I do wish I went to South by Southwest just to taste computer.
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:23.620]   That's very huge line for that thing.
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:24.620]   Yeah.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:25.620]   Oh, John, you were there.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:26.620]   No, yeah, there was.
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:27.620]   There was a huge line.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.620]   That's what I said.
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:30.420]   There was a huge line for that thing.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:31.820]   There was a huge line for that thing.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:32.820]   Right.
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:33.820]   Right.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:34.820]   What are we eating now?
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:35.820]   Adrian, Jeffries.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:37.820]   If she throws up.
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:40.100]   What does she say?
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.100]   We're pie B.M.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.100]   Food Truck.
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.660]   This project about two years ago, we wanted to see.
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:46.940]   Sounds French, so it's got to be good.
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:50.940]   Could be creative if they could not only reason about the world.
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:51.940]   To live.
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.940]   Flawing up.
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:53.940]   Vanilla.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.940]   So is the guy.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.780]   We're in your software engineer right there.
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:58.300]   And they are also valuable.
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.540]   When you rather have a Frenchman cook for you than design software for you?
[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:02.540]   Oh my God.
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:03.540]   I'm not the guy.
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.340]   Yeah, he's all Mr. Pierce.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:10.260]   You need to make because you have to kind of direct the computer in a certain direction.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:12.620]   And then the computer gives you suggestions.
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:15.020]   It tells you, oh, you chose chicken.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:17.780]   Chicken is used a lot in maybe a single Korean cuisine.
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:20.540]   Do you want to make a single burger in dish?
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:21.540]   It's called a menu.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:22.540]   This is done.
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:23.540]   That's stupid.
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:26.020]   All of that power to do that really.
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:29.020]   I love that like Epicurious was not good enough.
[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:30.020]   So they had to take Wasp.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:31.020]   Right.
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.020]   Hospital like where he was.
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:35.820]   He was on diagnostications.
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:37.060]   You know, solving.
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:38.500]   Pecuring cancer.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:42.580]   No, we need to come up with a new Singaporean stapling instead.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:43.580]   That was very warm.
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:48.380]   I think that the IBM Watson team really just wanted to go to South bike and get drunk.
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:50.380]   That's only the excuse.
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:56.340]   Well, OK, if we're being serious for a second, if computers can learn how to cook, isn't
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:57.340]   it cool?
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:59.140]   It's better than hot pockets.
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.140]   Hot pockets.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.900]   It's better than hot pockets.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.380]   Anything is better than hot pockets.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:05.220]   No, nothing is better than hot pockets.
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:06.940]   I beg to differ.
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:08.780]   Bull hot pockets.
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:10.700]   You don't even eat pot pockets.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:15.780]   If I opened on the Champs de Lise, a hot pocket stand, it would be huge.
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:20.460]   Well, if they didn't burn the place down, then French should be ashamed of themselves.
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:21.940]   Interesting thing.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:27.140]   One of the biggest culinary stories of last year was that Burger King is coming back to
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:28.140]   France.
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.140]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:30.140]   It was a really big deal.
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:31.140]   They were right out.
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:34.980]   What happened to the French that used to burn places like that to the ground?
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:35.980]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:41.820]   I guess the kids who used to go to Burger King before he'd closed in Paris grew up and
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:45.260]   are now running the place, which is worrisome.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:50.420]   No, I mean, I think we don't have the same disdain that you guys have for fast food because
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.580]   we take it for what it is.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:54.900]   It's a cool thing that you eat when you don't have time.
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:59.700]   And it's also a little bit less disgusting in our fast food restaurants than it is in
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:00.700]   yours.
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:01.980]   No, I beg to differ.
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:03.740]   They put mayonnaise on the freets.
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:05.740]   It's disgusting.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.220]   Can I?
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:10.940]   Why don't they use Watts in the mind Bitcoin?
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:11.940]   That would be a good deal.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.540]   The answers to a server farmers are minding Bitcoin.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.180]   Some surprise these companies don't do that.
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:19.460]   There's a lot of idle CPU power out there that could be used in mind Bitcoins.
[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:23.420]   I don't understand it.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.420]   Popcorn time.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:29.260]   I wonder why this got so much attention and why people were so shocked that this application,
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:34.540]   which basically was let you torrent, find movies on torrents like Netflix and then watch
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:37.300]   them, got shut down like in three minutes.
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:38.300]   In three minutes?
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.300]   What a shock.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:40.300]   In three minutes.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:41.300]   It was like a...
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:42.300]   Oh, it was up for...
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:46.540]   I mean, after the slew of articles, it was up for three days and then they had to shut
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.540]   down, obviously.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:53.020]   But in the meantime, I don't know if you guys saw that email, but I got an email from
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:59.420]   XBMC who was seeing all this happening and the email was entitled something along the
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:06.860]   lines of want to know what the real pirate Netflix app is and selling their own product.
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:07.860]   We've got it.
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:08.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:13.340]   I was like, are you really pitching yourself as the pirate Netflix?
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:14.340]   It's weird.
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:16.900]   Because Netflix is so expensive.
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:17.900]   Yeah, really.
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:18.900]   799.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:19.900]   Come on.
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:23.580]   Maybe this was not on Apple's App Store or Android's Play Store.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:27.820]   You had to get it from a mega.co.nz.
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:29.540]   This is the statement.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:31.140]   After three days, they shut down.
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:36.180]   Popcorn time is shutting down today, not because we ran out of energy, commitment, focus
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:40.620]   or allies, but because we need to move on with our lives.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.620]   What?
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:44.180]   Why did they even start in the first place?
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:45.180]   Three days.
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:46.180]   Three days.
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.180]   It's time to move on with my life.
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:50.180]   Three days.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:52.180]   I don't think it's going to be this much work.
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.180]   I'm out of here.
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.180]   They worked on it longer than that, obviously.
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:58.260]   What were they thinking?
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:02.780]   They were thinking that the service was legal in the countries where it was well.
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:03.780]   Okay.
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:08.140]   The service was not illegal in the countries where it was not illegal.
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:11.740]   Obviously some people disagreed.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:14.380]   So by the way, the code is still around.
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:18.980]   You can download it, build it, install it yourself.
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:19.980]   It's not gone.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:20.980]   It's on GitHub.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:26.260]   Well, the thing is, it's not doing anything illegal by itself.
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:28.260]   Yeah, that's what the pirate base is.
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:29.260]   Exactly.
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:32.180]   We don't store anything illegal.
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:35.260]   It's like those little antennas.
[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:37.460]   Those aren't illegal.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.260]   They quadrupled check the legality.
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.500]   They said, "Let's do it."
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:41.500]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:42.500]   And then we'll go to the next one later.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.500]   We're getting on with our lives.
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.060]   Thank you very much.
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:46.540]   It's over.
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:51.420]   Amazon's going to raise the price of Amazon Prime.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.340]   20 bucks.
[01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:55.060]   I thought it was going to go higher than that.
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.060]   I was a little worried.
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:57.060]   It will.
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:58.060]   It still will.
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.060]   It will.
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.220]   I would just say this is a stepping stone.
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.220]   The beginning.
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:03.780]   It was $79.
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:08.740]   Amazon Prime gives you free two-day shipping on anything Amazon sells, not on everything
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:12.140]   on the Amazon site, but anything that they fulfill.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:13.940]   They also give you instant video.
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.700]   A lot of crappy movies you don't want to watch.
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:22.020]   There's a good things on there like Rubicon, the 13-part series that ran once on AMC.
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.020]   Very good story.
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:24.020]   Actually, right.
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.380]   Instant video has some better stuff.
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:27.620]   It's nice in conjunction with Netflix.
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:28.620]   Yeah.
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:31.780]   You can also, as a Kindle user, borrow an e-book every month.
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:32.780]   Right.
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:35.700]   And they also give you a free e-book every month.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:36.700]   Ah.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:37.700]   I got one the other day.
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:38.700]   What was it?
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:39.700]   It was free.
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:40.700]   What the hell?
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:41.700]   It was free.
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:42.700]   I just picked it and it was like, it's not on the Kindle.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.180]   Is it any book or do you have it?
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.180]   No, no.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:47.100]   They give you like six choices and, you know, it's a scam.
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:48.900]   Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:49.900]   No.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:50.900]   No, these are all.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:52.700]   Link House by Charles Dickens.
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:54.740]   Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain.
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:55.740]   It's like that, isn't it?
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:56.740]   No, not at all.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:59.060]   In fact, it's contemporary authors you've never heard of.
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:00.060]   It's even better.
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:02.540]   It's even better.
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:06.060]   So they were, they debated anywhere between $20 and $40.
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:09.060]   But I thought they'd end up on the high, on the increase, the high end of the year.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.220]   They're going to have trouble with $20.
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:14.580]   Due to the increased cost of fuel and transportation, if you read the book, The Everything Store
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:19.300]   by Brad Stone about Amazon, the guests, they completely guessed at $79.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:22.060]   They had no idea what prime would cost them.
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:24.660]   And what did it cost them?
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:25.660]   No one even knows.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.900]   Amazon's so willing to lose money on something like that.
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:28.900]   They don't care.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:33.020]   It's like, yeah, we lost money on every sale, but we got lots more customers.
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.020]   That's the, that's how they say it.
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:37.100]   You know what I think about Amazon?
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:41.220]   I don't think that they are so blind about their financials.
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:47.980]   I think a store that can revolutionize the way that we do distribution and shipping,
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:54.620]   have it down to a science, have it so pristinely timed within the warehouses.
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:57.380]   Do you really think that they don't know what's going on with their financials?
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.020]   No, they know exactly what's going on.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:00.020]   Good point.
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:04.980]   There's so many small companies that they are very good at hiding their money.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:05.980]   That's what I really think.
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:06.980]   I think they know.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:09.940]   I think they're willing to lose money to put other businesses out of business.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:12.140]   They're just not going to tell you how much they're losing.
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:15.860]   And I think they're also willing to lose money just to gain consumers.
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:20.100]   But I do believe that when they first came up with prime, they just really didn't know
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.620]   how many people would use it, how much the shipping would end up costing them, whether
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:26.580]   they would make more of the money up in the amount of sales and so forth.
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:29.180]   I think that was a bit of a guess.
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:34.580]   In fact, it was supposedly Jeff Bezos who just said, "After much debate, $79.
[01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:36.700]   We'll figure it out from there."
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:39.740]   But you make a good point because it didn't change for years.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:45.740]   Well, I think going forward, if you are an existing prime member, this year is still
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:47.380]   $79.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:49.700]   If you have an auto renewal, I believe it is.
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:52.500]   And students actually get a discount.
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:56.020]   It's half price from the typical prime membership.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:59.140]   So if you are a student or if you're in a family and you have a student and you can
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.700]   sign up using their credentials, then you get a nice little chunk of change back on
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:03.700]   that.
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:06.140]   Well, there's a tip worth the price of admission to the show.
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.140]   Yeah.
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.900]   Now how much would you pay, huh?
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:09.900]   No, apparently 35 bucks.
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:10.900]   Do you come in?
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:13.140]   Do you come in night of the Twitch round table?
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.580]   Yeah, I'd like to see that.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:16.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:19.700]   I don't think anything about Amazon.
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.860]   A lot of its products are just cash registers.
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:26.740]   Like the Kindle is a cash register for buying other products in the Amazon store.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:31.660]   When I started looking deeply into the streaming aspect of Amazon, I really, really felt like
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:36.140]   I was getting nickel and dimes because as much as there's a lot of stuff to be streamed
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:42.780]   for free, there's also a whole bunch of content that isn't free, that is then advertised to
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:49.140]   you for two or three dollars to rent it, $7, $8, $9 to buy it.
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:55.500]   But it's not really clear if you need to be a prime member or not in order to stream
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.700]   the content that's paid.
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:03.420]   So it's this weird thing that you're afraid, if I lose my prime membership, do I also lose
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:08.660]   the ability to buy this streamed content that's not free and part of prime?
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:12.660]   And I believe the answer is that no, anybody can buy it for the price that it is.
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:17.940]   But it's so murky in the way that it's designed that you can't tell.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:23.420]   They have, but only in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, they have a grocery store delivery
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:26.020]   service fresh.
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:29.660]   And you can also do prime fresh for $300 a year.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:36.420]   You'll get your groceries same day or next day early morning on orders over 35 bucks.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:40.180]   See, that seems like, I don't know if I'd paid $300 a year for same day.
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:46.220]   If you were working in a company in the dog patch area doing web development or software
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:52.460]   development and you had 20 or 20 guys there working there, 12 hours, 16 hours a day, and
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:53.820]   they needed to eat.
[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:54.820]   I think you would pay that.
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:58.460]   Don't give me, no, I want meals cooked ready to eat.
[01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:00.380]   I probably have that available.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:03.380]   I want Amazon to feed me, bathe me, close me.
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:05.820]   You should just go work for Google, wipe my butt.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:08.620]   Google does all that.
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:12.780]   I use fresh direct sometimes and they have, you know, a similar thing where you get free
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:13.780]   delivery.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:17.340]   And I don't remember what the price is on that.
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:22.020]   But the real key there is when you have it in cities where people don't have cars and
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:25.580]   carrying a lot of heavy groceries to our homes is really inconvenient.
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:29.780]   So the ability to order something online, especially like if I'm going to have a party,
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:34.500]   if I can get some cases of beer delivered to my house and all the food and all the paper
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:37.420]   products that I need, like that's worthwhile.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:39.540]   Why should you carry a case of beer ups?
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:41.100]   Your seven story walk up.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:45.420]   And you can get some minimum wage worker to do it.
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:48.340]   It's that and it's slavery.
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:51.460]   If you're starting to talk about costs, it's also about the price.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:58.020]   I mean, if I live in a fairly expensive neighborhood and our local grocery store is really expensive.
[01:41:58.020 --> 01:42:04.340]   So if I could order from Amazon, fresh stuff, I would do it all the time.
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:07.100]   Safeway does deliver here and you can't tip the guys.
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.700]   You try to tip them and they say, no, we're union.
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:10.700]   You can't do it.
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:11.700]   That's a little excuse.
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:12.700]   I know.
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:14.780]   I thought what kind of union is that?
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:16.820]   This is a lucky union.
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:17.980]   You cannot take tips.
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:21.180]   I thought that was a strange response.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:25.180]   Well, it's probably has to do with some negotiation that took place at one point where the management
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:29.540]   people having done unions myself, the management people said, well, you get all this money
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:30.540]   on tips.
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:32.260]   We don't have to pay it on the per hourly basis.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:37.180]   So they rejected tips and said, because you're going to get screwed by the man.
[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:38.180]   So we can't ask for tips.
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:39.180]   There you go.
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:44.100]   So Jill, do you use this regularly or just for special occasions?
[01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:49.500]   I use fresh direct, I'd say probably a dozen times a year or so.
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:52.140]   Mostly for special occasions, but yeah, it is really handy.
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:57.620]   And there are other grocery stores that have delivery, but the experience of being able
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:01.860]   to order online have all of my shopping lists saved.
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:04.460]   Like that's a very Amazon-like experience.
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:08.140]   And while fresh direct is the one that we have here that's convenient that everybody
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:11.660]   knows, if we had Amazon fresh here, I don't know.
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:13.540]   I might probably try it.
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:14.540]   New York's next.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:15.540]   I mean, what better?
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:20.060]   You got to go in the major metros where there's huge population density is just more effective.
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:22.460]   You can get anything delivered here.
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:23.460]   Anything?
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.460]   Yeah.
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:25.460]   Anything.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:26.460]   Anything.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:27.460]   Anything.
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:30.940]   I want a gold tooth.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:31.940]   Amazon is...
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:34.300]   I don't understand this.
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:35.980]   Amazon media streamer.
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:41.260]   They've been going through FCC approval on this thing.
[01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:43.540]   It's more than just a Roku.
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:49.020]   It's a set top box that has a game controller.
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:52.780]   So Netflix and Hulu, yes.
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:54.420]   It's running on ForkDandroid.
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:57.300]   That's Amazon does that like the Kindle.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:05.540]   And apparently, according to the FCC documents, there is a Bluetooth game controller which
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:07.300]   really has a lot of buttons on it.
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:08.540]   This looks pretty serious.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:11.620]   It's about as good, yeah.
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:12.620]   Amazon.
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:17.940]   I think it's how long before Amazon has same day delivery in big cities like New York.
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:19.460]   They just kind of bring it to you.
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.060]   We'll have it for you in a couple hours.
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:24.620]   And by the way, why does Amazon still use UPS?
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.060]   Why don't they have their own delivery services?
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:27.260]   I'm surprised they haven't bought UPS.
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.620]   Yeah, I am too.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.900]   Seems like that would be a way to save money.
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:36.500]   So as you see the new Roku thing, they got a little plug-in deal.
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:37.500]   They have that for a while.
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:38.500]   The Roku stick.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:39.500]   Yeah, I have the old one.
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.180]   It's got more stuff going on.
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:42.580]   It's kind of an interesting thing.
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:44.180]   It reboots a lot on me.
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:46.860]   You need to have a special kind of HDMI port that has power.
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:48.500]   It's an MLC port.
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:50.660]   I happen to have one device that does.
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:55.060]   So you plug it in and then it gives Roku capability to that HDMI port, which is kind
[01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:56.060]   of neat.
[01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:58.140]   Have you been playing with?
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:03.100]   You've obviously played with USB 3.
[01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:04.100]   Yes.
[01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:05.580]   These new little hard disks that are coming out.
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:06.580]   They run fast.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:08.140]   Oh, they're astonishing.
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:10.260]   They go as the same speed as an internal drive.
[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:11.260]   I know.
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.260]   Practically.
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:13.260]   No.
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:15.220]   I have one that goes the Toshiba little Toshiba guy.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.900]   You have slow internal drives.
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:19.260]   No, I don't.
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:21.060]   I'm putting it up against an SSD.
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:22.060]   Really?
[01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.060]   No, it's not that fast.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:25.060]   MHL, not what did I say?
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:26.060]   MHL port.
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:27.060]   Absolutely.
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:28.060]   Thank you.
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:32.380]   So this is a $50 streaming media stick the size of a pack of gum plugs into your HDMI
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:33.380]   port.
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:35.340]   Does have a remote control.
[01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:40.340]   This new one does not require a MHL.
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:46.020]   The new Roku streaming stick, instead of using MHL, requires a special HDMI port.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:49.300]   Well, that's what MHL is.
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:51.260]   To send power as well as video.
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.260]   It is.
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:53.260]   Oh, I see.
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:58.900]   Now it has a separate USB plug like the Chromecast that can plug into a USB port.
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:00.460]   Yeah, just plug it right in to give it power.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:04.860]   That actually is better because while MHL is a great idea, it just didn't take off.
[01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:11.780]   So it's the same specs as the Roku 1 1080p capable media hub.
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:14.660]   I really like the Roku 3, frankly.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:18.820]   It's missing some of those features like the remote headphone jack.
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.820]   It's nice on that one.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:22.220]   So what's the difference with an actual Roku box?
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:23.220]   The regular one.
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:27.540]   It looks like the channels are the same.
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.860]   It's pretty much the same.
[01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:32.300]   It just doesn't have a headphone jack on the remote.
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:37.100]   Oh, and it does have dual band AB, G, and NYFI.
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:39.460]   That's good.
[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:43.820]   But they still will sell the MHL streaming stick, but that's because it's a limited market.
[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:47.740]   They're going to bundle it with TVs and so forth.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:51.420]   I'll take a break and then we will wrap things up.
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:57.580]   I'm so glad to have you Jill Duffy from PC Magazine, Mr. John C. Devorak from No Agenda
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:03.100]   at Patrick Bezha from La Jolla.
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:04.100]   Look forward on Patreon.
[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:06.660]   You know, I write for PC Magazine too.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:07.660]   Still?
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:10.580]   Yeah, twice.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:12.580]   Now twice a week.
[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:15.860]   Shoulder day brought to you by LegalZoom.
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:17.540]   You know LegalZoom is not.
[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:19.780]   They're not a law firm.
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:20.980]   I heard this.
[01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:24.980]   But they are providing you self-help services at your specific direction.
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:29.100]   So it turns out a lot of the things one might want to do with an expensive law firm.
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:30.100]   You don't need a law firm.
[01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:31.740]   Not a lot of just forms.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:32.740]   You know what?
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:33.740]   A ton of it.
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:34.740]   A boiler plate.
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:35.740]   It's boiler plate.
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:39.940]   I set up the LLC that we still run on LegalZoom.
[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:43.820]   $99 plus filing fees.
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:46.180]   You can also do an S-Corp or a C-Corp.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:47.740]   Very simple.
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:49.180]   Very simple.
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:52.420]   If you don't have a trademark, you might want to check out LegalZoom.
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:56.100]   Trademark, your name or your product.
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.940]   Last wheel in Testament.
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:00.500]   And there are times when you say, "Gee, I wish I could ask an attorney."
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:03.380]   Like, what state should I incorporate?
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:04.740]   Or what is the difference in each other?
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:08.060]   I think you should incorporate in the state of sobriety.
[01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:09.060]   Never.
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:12.020]   That's a boring state.
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:13.740]   Is that Utah, right?
[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:15.980]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:17.940]   Visit lealzoom.com.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.940]   This is National Start Your Business Month.
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:21.540]   John, do you have a business?
[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:23.540]   John--
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:24.540]   You.
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:25.540]   You're the business.
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:26.540]   John's the Devorat company.
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.300]   But maybe you could sell vinegar on the side or--
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.060]   You want me to finish the vinegar book?
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:33.900]   If you have-- this is National Start Your Own Business Month, John.
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:36.020]   Yes, National Finish The Vinegar Book Book.
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:37.980]   Everybody should start their own business.
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:42.020]   If you go to LegalZoom right now, you-- they have a special deal for you.
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:43.260]   You know, I forgot to bring vinegar.
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:44.260]   You're right.
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:45.260]   I know.
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:46.260]   That's what you were doing.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:48.580]   I have a trial of the all-new QuickBooks.
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:49.580]   Three months free.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:51.300]   That's worth $119.
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.300]   But you have to enter TWIT.
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:58.220]   And the referral box at checkout will also give you $10 off any LegalZoom service.
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.220]   I love LegalZoom.
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:04.140]   And I think a lot of entrepreneurs-- something like a million entrepreneurs have used LegalZoom
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:08.820]   to start their business-- are very grateful that LegalZoom exists.
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:14.460]   LegalZoom.com-- wills for $69, LLCs, $99 plus filing fees, the legal plan attorneys you can

[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:34.580]   QuickBooks LegalZoom.com/-- no, not/just use the offer code TWIT.
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:36.420]   And thank you, LegalZoom.
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:37.900]   Thank you.
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:43.820]   Without you, we wouldn't be able to keep John C. de Vorac in coffee mugs.
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:45.820]   I don't have that many coffee mugs.
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:46.820]   What do you got there?
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:47.820]   Is that a charger?
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:48.820]   Look at this thing.
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:49.820]   It's not a Chad brought out.
[01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:50.820]   It's like a car battery.
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:51.820]   It's a big battery.
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:52.820]   I put it in my phone hook to it.
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:55.260]   It's like something you'd find at the airport.
[01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:57.260]   We offer this for all of our guests.
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:49:58.260]   Charge your phone here.
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:49:59.260]   Yeah.
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:00.260]   It says it right on the top.
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:01.260]   Yeah.
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:02.260]   Isn't that nice?
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:03.260]   It's kind of corny.
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:05.100]   But it has all the connectors.
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:07.420]   How many quarters did you put in six quarters?
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:09.300]   I had to put in-- no, it's four quarters.
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:10.300]   You got it wrong.
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:11.300]   The dollar.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:13.420]   It turns itself off, though, apparently.
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:14.420]   It's right shortly.
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:18.460]   It's like the magic fingers in the bed.
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:23.260]   Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Jill for being here and for putting up with us.
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:24.260]   She's a good sport.
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.260]   I'm in love, guys.
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:26.460]   You're a good sport.
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:27.460]   What's you up to?
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:28.460]   Anything you want to plug or talk about?
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:29.460]   This is your chance.
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:30.460]   Oh, yes.
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:32.460]   I have to tell you about my book.
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:34.820]   I wrote a book last year.
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:39.740]   It's called How to Clean Up Your Messy Digital Life.
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:45.180]   So if you are flooded with emails, if you don't know how to find those wonderful vacation
[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:50.260]   photos that are digital somewhere on your machine from when you were in Tahiti in 2005,
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:55.620]   I have a whole book giving you steps on how to do this very easily.
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:57.980]   Every day things, anybody can do it.
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:01.180]   It is not for tech heads necessarily.
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:02.180]   It's for anybody.
[01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:04.740]   I wish I had known about this before the show.
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:07.220]   I'd been asking you advice all this time.
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:09.780]   Well, you'll have to have me come back, I suppose.
[01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:10.860]   I need help.
[01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:13.260]   Is it on Amazon?
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:14.820]   It is.
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:16.060]   It's an ebook primarily.
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:20.460]   You can get a print copy, but I definitely like the ebook where it's supported.
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:22.620]   There are video tutorials.
[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:25.660]   So those would be on the iPad version.
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:27.100]   There's a Nook version.
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:31.100]   There's the standard ePub, whatever you use.
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:32.100]   There is a version for it.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:34.100]   I definitely recommend the ebook.
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:36.180]   Give us your top tip.
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:37.180]   You know, she writes a week's leave.
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:38.180]   Password manager.
[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:39.180]   Password manager.
[01:51:39.180 --> 01:51:43.260]   I had no idea this was something I was so passionate about.
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:47.580]   I talk about every time somebody asks me about tips and apps, I'm like, are you using
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:51.740]   a password manager because if not, we have to stop talking right now and you have to
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:52.740]   get that.
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:56.460]   And I think a lot of people don't really know what password managers do if they've never
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:57.460]   seen one before.
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:00.820]   So one of the videos in the books shows you, this is a password manager.
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:01.820]   This is how it works.
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:03.020]   This is how simple it is.
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:04.020]   And they're free.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:05.300]   You don't have to pay anything to use.
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:07.540]   Which one do you use?
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:12.820]   I use Dashlane, which is no longer free, but I was grandfathered in.
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:14.860]   Last pass is the other one we always recommend.
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:16.340]   That's the one I love and use.
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:18.540]   I just use the same password for everything.
[01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:19.540]   That's another way.
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:20.540]   That's a shortcut.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.180]   Is it one, two, three, four, five, six?
[01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:24.140]   I think it's monkey one, two, three.
[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:25.140]   Right?
[01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:26.140]   No.
[01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:27.140]   So you never guessed it.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:29.340]   That's the reason it's so effective.
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:31.940]   It's a scam.
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:33.340]   I get no spam.
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:34.340]   It's a scam.
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:36.060]   It's exactly what I have to change it now.
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:37.300]   The world's Dashlane.
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:38.300]   It comes from the two.
[01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:39.300]   Huh?
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:42.300]   So last pass is a buck a month for the professional version.
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:43.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:44.700]   Yeah, but you can have a free version.
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:50.580]   Dashlane, one of the things I really like about this is when you do online shopping,
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:55.220]   it takes screenshots of every page as you're shopping along.
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:59.380]   So if you never get the email confirmation that you were waiting for, there was a confirmation
[01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:00.940]   on screen, you have a screenshot of it.
[01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:02.380]   Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:03.820]   That actually is really cool.
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:04.820]   Yeah.
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:06.540]   All right, I'm going to check it out, Dashlane.
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:12.660]   And of course, Jill's column every week in PCMag, get organized.
[01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:14.940]   You know, I love it because that's kind of the clap.
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:17.980]   I used to read hints from HelloEas and all that stuff in the newspaper.
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:22.460]   That's kind of the classic column, like cleaning tips and stuff like that.
[01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:23.460]   And now we do it digitally.
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.060]   You said you read that?
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:27.340]   I loved hints from HelloEas.
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:30.940]   Did you know you can wrap tin foil around a potato?
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:33.780]   And it's a scraping grill.
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:36.700]   And use it to scrub your grill.
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:41.260]   That's a fantastic concept.
[01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:43.860]   I'm going to use that tonight's barbecue.
[01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:47.220]   Not your gold tooth.
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:51.660]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:53.860]   Thank you, Jill, for being here and putting up with us.
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:54.860]   Seriously.
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:55.860]   Really appreciate it.
[01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:57.420]   We'll look forward to seeing you soon.
[01:53:57.420 --> 01:53:59.460]   I actually want to talk about email.
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:02.700]   We should just spend a day just talking about how to handle your email.
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:04.180]   That's a big one.
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:05.180]   We could do that.
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:07.260]   Email is a failed technology, in my opinion.
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:11.020]   I'm not going to argue the point.
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:14.420]   I think what we should do, by the way, is get Jill and maybe a few other people put together
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:19.820]   a little group and design an email program that everyone should use.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:22.820]   People have tried and tried to find a stuff that I just wanted to do.
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:25.260]   Well, they tried.
[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:28.100]   The problem always tends to be the back end falls apart.
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:31.380]   If you cut a potato in half and rub it on the grill before you cook, it'll keep the meat
[01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:32.380]   from sticking.
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:33.380]   Who said that?
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:35.380]   I don't think that's true.
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:40.740]   I don't think so.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:44.180]   Patrick Deja, you are so realistic.
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.180]   I got nauseous.
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:46.180]   Deja vu.
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:49.260]   Nice to have you, Patrick.
[01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:53.460]   The Phileus Club is no longer with us, but there is Laurent de Voutéc.
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:54.860]   Yes, there is.
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:58.580]   Laurent de Voutéc is my French Tech News show.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:54:59.860]   I've been doing it for a while.
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:04.780]   If you're interested, if you speak French, if you use to speak French, if you're interested
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:10.180]   in getting news in French about tech, which makes it easier for you to understand because
[01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:16.140]   you already know the subject matter, you can find all of that on PatrickBeja.com and
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:18.060]   the Patreon, by the way.
[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:19.060]   R-D-V tech.
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:20.060]   Patreon.com/rdvtech.
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:21.060]   Exactly.
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:25.500]   Patreon.com/rdvtech is the place.
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:27.700]   I'm not Patrick on Twitter.
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:29.700]   Who are you?
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:30.700]   Who?
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:32.860]   Well, see, everyone says that.
[01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:37.060]   And really wonders why I'm called not Patrick on Twitter.
[01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:40.140]   And what I say is no one ever forgets it.
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:41.140]   Not Patrick.
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:42.140]   It's you are Patrick.
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:44.100]   Yeah, that makes no sense.
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.100]   You remember it.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:46.100]   That's what counts.
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:47.100]   And then be not Leo.
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:48.100]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:49.620]   Yeah, that's what I've always said that.
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:51.420]   That's been my motto.
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:58.700]   Anybody but Leo is my brother's royalty free music service.
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:55:59.700]   Yes.
[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:04.940]   Every time I mention it on the show, he tells me what happened overnight I got a ton of
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:06.340]   visits.
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:08.500]   So it's musicincloud.com.
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:14.860]   If you're looking for some really good royalty free music, you pay the license and that's
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:17.820]   it for your videos corporate or anything like that.
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:19.860]   Just go to musicincloud.com.
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:21.420]   Musicincloud.com.
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:23.980]   He does all the music for my podcast.
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:26.020]   So I'm happy to recommend it.
[01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:27.700]   Is this him playing all of these?
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:31.300]   Him and his wife do all those really.
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:36.300]   And it's actually well, he's my brother, but it's actually really good.
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:37.940]   So there you go.
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:40.300]   He's like the pomple mousse of France.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:42.420]   What does that mean?
[01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:44.260]   Grapefruit.
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:48.660]   I think it's spelled weirdly.
[01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:51.660]   It's not exactly, I don't know, maybe it is.
[01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:52.900]   Yeah, it is grapefruit.
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:53.900]   Don't you speak French?
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:59.580]   Because I'm not even very thick as I'm for no reason.
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:00.860]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:01.860]   Just teasing you.
[01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:05.660]   Hey, I forgot to mention, I'm really excited about this.
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:11.020]   Neil Young's Pono Music Project is finally on Kickstarter.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:14.660]   He's been talking for a long time about making a music player that instead of playing back
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:21.180]   highly compressed, squeezed down, all the life of it squeezed out music, the Pono, which
[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:27.540]   is a kind of odd triangular form factor, will playback flack, uncompressed flack, audio
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:38.940]   as at as high a quality is 192 by 24, which is considerably higher even than uncompressed
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:39.940]   CD.
[01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:45.740]   192 kilohertz 24-bit flack files will, because that's this-
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.300]   Does the amount of money he's got?
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:48.300]   Huh?
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:49.300]   He's raised.
[01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:50.300]   He launched this on Tuesday.
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:51.300]   I immediately got in.
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:54.740]   I was lucky too, because- What do you get for getting in?
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:58.300]   I got a Pono player in November, I hope.
[01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:03.820]   He was looking for $800,000 in just a few days, $3.8 million, because this is a great idea.
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:05.340]   Yeah, because he's Neil Young.
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:06.900]   Well, there's that.
[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:14.660]   And they have, you can get autographed, metal autographed, laser autographed, artist signature
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:20.140]   series from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Willie Nelson, James Taylor, My Morning Jacket.
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:22.740]   That should be worth it for Apple.
[01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:23.740]   Tom Apple.
[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:24.740]   Metallica.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:29.580]   I chose the Neil Young one, which is sold out on, but I'm excited.
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:33.980]   I think this is a big deal if you can make this happen.
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:37.540]   And he can get the record companies to give him the original master's.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:40.380]   That's part of the problem, because these are unprotected.
[01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:42.020]   They're not copy- Oh, no.
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.020]   I know.
[01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:45.100]   This is not going to happen.
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:46.100]   What?
[01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:47.100]   No, it's unprotected.
[01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:48.260]   You can't do anything.
[01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:51.420]   This is the way- And this would be the quality of the studio master's.
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:53.420]   Yeah, and they're not going to give that away.
[01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:54.420]   No.
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:55.420]   I want this to happen.
[01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:56.420]   I'm so excited.
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:59.100]   Oh, he's planning the store to go along with it.
[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:00.100]   Right.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:02.700]   PonoMusic.com will be the store once this all takes off.
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:05.300]   He's got a lot of big names involved in this thing.
[01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:07.300]   Nora Jones.
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:09.100]   No, he's been working on this for a long time.
[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:10.100]   Yeah.
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:11.620]   Yeah, I'm excited about this.
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:16.300]   I'm going to get a little sticker that says I backed Pono.
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.300]   It sounds obscene.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:20.140]   It doesn't sound good.
[01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:21.300]   John, did you have anything?
[01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:25.540]   I mean, I know you don't, but it's off the top of your head that you'd like to plug.
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:26.540]   Divorak.org/blog.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:28.580]   I haven't done that for a while.
[01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:32.420]   You can find me on PC Magazine if you look around hard enough.
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:34.660]   Also knowajendashow.com.
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:35.940]   I think people know about that.
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:36.940]   They should go check it out.
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:41.980]   Every once we still get a Twit Listener every month or so, say, you know, I've been plugging
[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:42.980]   that thing.
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:43.980]   I find this is great.
[01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:44.980]   It's not a bad show, actually.
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:50.380]   So six, I've done 600 shows and channeldivorak.com.
[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:51.380]   Also DH unplugged.
[01:59:51.380 --> 01:59:52.380]   It says, what's that?
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:55.940]   The stock market show that we do with Horowitz.
[01:59:55.940 --> 01:59:59.060]   And so, and we're going to turn that into another model.
[01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:01.380]   We're going to do a firewall.
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:02.380]   Awesome.
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:05.780]   So, ladies and gentlemen, they're old.
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:06.780]   Thank you, Chad.
[02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:07.780]   A couple of things.
[02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:09.340]   Can I do some house ads real quick?
[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.340]   Thank you, Jill.
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:11.340]   Thank you.
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:12.340]   I love house ads.
[02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:13.340]   What are you asking me?
[02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:14.340]   Real quick, ladies.
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.340]   Just want to mention teespring.com/twit.
[02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:16.340]   Are we still selling the hoodies?
[02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:17.340]   We are.
[02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:19.980]   We've sold 471 towards our goal of 300.
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:22.820]   So that means in a week and three days, we're going to have to make some.
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:23.820]   They're beautiful.
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:24.820]   The new Twit List.
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:25.820]   What are they sell for?
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:26.820]   Oh, thousands.
[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:27.820]   I don't know.
[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:28.820]   How much they sell for?
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:30.140]   35 bucks.
[02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:31.820]   We have men's and women's.
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:33.620]   The Bella women's fleece.
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:35.180]   The women got a zip one?
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:38.060]   The only difference to men's and women's is the women's have a pointy head.
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:40.540]   Well, that makes them look like they're in the clan.
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:41.540]   Oh, they're witches.
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:42.540]   See that?
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:43.540]   That's the only difference.
[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:44.540]   That's not, I don't know.
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:45.540]   This seems pointy head.
[02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:46.540]   I don't know.
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:48.540]   I think there's maybe more than that.
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:49.540]   Okay.
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:54.260]   And ladies and gentlemen, we did have quite the week on Twit.
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:58.820]   If you missed any of it, we have edited it down into 60 seconds that really give you
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:00.820]   the full scope of the opportunity.
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:01.820]   And this I got to see.
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:03.820]   Previously on Twit.
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:04.820]   Twit Live specials.
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:09.100]   At first time, I think that we've heard from Edward Snowden since he disappeared.
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:13.340]   He's kind of reaching out to the tech community and saying, okay, it's your responsibility
[02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:16.260]   to make this revolutionary change.
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:21.340]   This week in Google, Google apparently is searching for retail space in New York City.
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:23.740]   And maybe there'll be a line around the corner of people who've been locked out of their
[02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:24.820]   Gmail account.
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:27.380]   Security now.
[02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:30.780]   But we're holding in our hands these little iPhones and iPads.
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:32.540]   They are little crypto bricks.
[02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:37.780]   They're amazing instances of applied cryptography.
[02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:38.780]   Matt break weekly.
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:40.580]   Do you think looks better in a monocle?
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:42.380]   Me or Tim Cook?
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:44.060]   Well, play Twit.
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:45.060]   Take it to the bank.
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:47.740]   I think in my monocle.
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:50.180]   I just don't understand 3D TV.
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:51.940]   What's the big deal?
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:54.580]   I love my monocle.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:55.580]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:56.580]   That's good.
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:59.940]   Pins and Nez is next.
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:02.060]   I want a lawn yet.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:03.060]   With a stick?
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:04.060]   A stick.
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:05.060]   Yeah.
[02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:06.060]   That's a stick.
[02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:09.460]   You raise it up to look over it.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:12.140]   We are not amused.
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:13.340]   Is there a week ahead?
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:14.340]   All right.
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:15.340]   Well, let's check in with Mike Elgin.
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:16.500]   See what's coming up this week.
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:20.540]   The annual TED conference begins Monday in Vancouver, Canada, as does the game developers
[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:22.300]   conference in San Francisco.
[02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:26.500]   Also, we'll be doing special reports on Tech News today next week covering incredible
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:29.660]   technology projects in Egypt and also Rwanda.
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:33.820]   So make sure you tune in to Tech News today each weekday at 10am Pacific.
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:34.820]   Back to you, Leo.
[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:36.380]   TED is in Vancouver now?
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:38.060]   Is it Ted Vancouver?
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:39.060]   It's not the TED?
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:40.060]   No.
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:42.420]   There's no-- I don't even know if they do the TED anymore.
[02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:44.060]   Of course, they do the TED.
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:45.820]   They do it-- they used to do it in Santa Monica.
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:46.820]   They're making so much money.
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:47.820]   For a while, they do.
[02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:50.980]   These TED Xs, it's like, geez.
[02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:52.940]   I think it's the TED.
[02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:53.940]   In Vancouver?
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:57.060]   Ted in Vancouver would be interesting.
[02:02:57.060 --> 02:02:59.260]   It's a great place.
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:01.580]   No, no, I like Vancouver.
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:02.580]   Yeah.
[02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:03.580]   Well, that's interesting.
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:05.380]   We'll follow it on that one.
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:07.700]   We'll talk about it.
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:09.980]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this edition of This Week in Tech.

[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:43.100]   Like that, right?
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:44.100]   Yeah.

[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:47.100]   Just give me $1,000.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:48.100]   You might be surprised.
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:49.100]   Oh, no, no, no.
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:50.100]   Please don't.
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:51.100]   You don't want it.
[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:52.100]   Please, I don't want you to give me a job.
[02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:55.100]   This is the kind of insincerity that doesn't work.
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:57.100]   Another twist is in the can.
[02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:58.100]   Do the twist.
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:03:59.100]   Do the twist.
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:00.100]   All right.
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:01.100]   Do the twist.
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:02.100]   All right.
[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:03.100]   Do the twist.
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:04.100]   All right.
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:05.100]   Do the twist.
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:06.100]   All right.
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.100]   Do the twist.
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:08.100]   All right.
