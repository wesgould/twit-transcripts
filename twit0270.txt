[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.320]   It's time for "Twit" this weekend tech
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.440]   to show the latest-- the week's tech news.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.840]   We aren't giving you the breaking news.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.600]   We're kind of chewing it over, mowing it over,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.160]   and explaining what it all means.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.320]   And so I like to get on the show people
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.880]   who can actually do that, starting with Harry McCracken
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.840]   from Technologizer, former editor-in-chief at PC World,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.640]   right?
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.200]   That's right.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.280]   And he's kind of going on his own,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.800]   and it sounds like it's going really well.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.840]   Things have been going so far, really so well so far.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.160]   I always say this is the hardest job I've ever had,
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.840]   but also the most fun.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.800]   Well, you know, I was talking with a friend,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.680]   Sarah Lane, who knows pretty well, knows MG Seeker.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.960]   And I was talking about blogging.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.280]   Well, let me before I do that, let's introduce another blogger.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.680]   But also a real live newspaper man,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320]   Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.120]   He's at blogs.cron.com/techblog,
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.080]   and a regular on the show.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.920]   Hey, Dwight.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   Hey, how are you doing, Leo?
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.440]   I'm doing great.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.920]   I see you again, Harry.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   Good to see you, Dwight.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.520]   You guys know each other.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.560]   We've hung out at CES.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.360]   It's the Interact on Twitter all the time.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.800]   It's a-- the tech journalist world is a small world,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.560]   which is fun, because we all know each other.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.600]   And when you go to conferences, that's
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.040]   what used to be great about Comdex.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.600]   As you'd see people once a year, that you--
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.400]   and it was always so much fun.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.920]   Although I'm not sure I would describe in the chaos
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.200]   of the CES press room that it's a small world.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.800]   It's a very compressed world.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.560]   Any more, yeah, that's true.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.080]   But I was talking with Sarah about her friend, MG Seeker,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.840]   who writes for TechCrunch.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.120]   And the world of the newspaper man
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.680]   was you could take a weekend off.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.560]   You'd have assignments.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.280]   You'd have a beat.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.640]   You didn't have to work 24/7, right, Dwight?
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.360]   I mean, it's my imagination anyway.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.320]   There was a hierarchy.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.640]   You had copy editors.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.280]   You had editors.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.880]   You had an assignment desk.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.320]   And so you weren't-- that wasn't all on your shoulders, was it?
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.280]   Well, to a certain extent, you were always on call.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.880]   I mean, no matter what beat I've done,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.800]   I've always been ready to jump in if something happened.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.300]   Right.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.560]   Yeah, but that's the fun of it.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.080]   If you're covering news, I remember we had you on,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.520]   and there were tornadoes or floods going on in Houston.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.000]   And you said, well, you know, acts of nature allowing,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.360]   I'll be able to do it.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.080]   That's fun, though.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.680]   That's the fun thing about being a news person,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.440]   when there's breaking news, you cover it.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.480]   That's right.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.720]   There's a certain amount of adrenaline,
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.320]   although what's interesting is before the advent of the web,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.160]   you know, you'd covered it what you did
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.600]   up here the next day in print.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.200]   And now you do it as it happens.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.960]   And that's a very different experience
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.400]   than that it was, you know, back in the day.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.760]   Well, and that's what I was observing.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.000]   And I was thinking, boy, I kind of feel for people like MG
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.640]   and you too, Harry.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.960]   Now, MG works for TechCrunch, but it's very much like you're
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.000]   on your own, you know, you don't have a quote apparently
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.680]   at TechCrunch, but boy, if you don't publish every day,
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.120]   if you're not constantly on the story, you know,
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.600]   you're going to be shunted aside.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.280]   And Harry, you're pretty much the guy at Technologizer.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.160]   Well, I do have a few other folks who write for me,
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.560]   but you know, it's been most of my career
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.640]   doing monthly computer magazines,
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.640]   which are the worst possible training ground for the web.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.280]   Because, you know, we literally would work on an issue
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.880]   sometimes for six months of the time.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.800]   It came up with an idea until the time we shipped it
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   out the door and we made everything perfect.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.640]   And you just don't do that on the web.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.480]   The quality comes more from the speed
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.360]   than from evolving and refining things
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.520]   and having them be absolutely flawless.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.800]   So it's been a great education.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.480]   Well, MG and Sarah took the day off yesterday
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.800]   to go to a concert on Treasure Island in San Francisco.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.880]   And I knew I could just feel how anxious MG would be
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.520]   that what if something happens?
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.600]   I'm out of touch.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.080]   I've got to be here 20.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.680]   That nowadays, being a blogger is a 24/7 job.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.840]   That too long after I started my site,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.800]   it was Labor Day in 2008.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.600]   And the news leaked that Google was doing the Chrome browser.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.120]   And that was perfect for bloggers
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.800]   because the people who have real day jobs
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.280]   looking at large media companies had the day off.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.520]   And so they did not leap on the story of Chrome,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.560]   which was pretty huge.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.920]   And even though it was theoretically a holiday for me,
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.360]   I did leap on it.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.960]   And that was one of the kind of a seminal moment
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.920]   at the start of my site because I had the story earlier
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.880]   than most people simply because I don't get to take the day off.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.840]   There's got to be a burnout factor though too, right?
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.640]   It's a challenge.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.680]   I mean, my goal is not to write the most stories.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.280]   It's to write stories that people care about.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.280]   And I think ultimately that's a better path to success.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.920]   And it's also a better path to not killing yourself.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.200]   If you just try to grind out 30 stories a day,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.320]   you will kill yourself and the stories won't be very good.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.560]   Right.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:34.160]   I mean, I just feel like not to slime Mike Harrington,
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.560]   but anybody who runs a big tech blog
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.800]   is just kind of going to burn those kids out as fast as they can.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.360]   And then the next group comes in.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.040]   Hey, look, G.C. Lard does a really good job
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.840]   by the way of doing a lot of stuff for doing really good stories.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.080]   He's one of the few people who seems to be able to do both.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.600]   I agree.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.920]   He's a great writer.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.160]   He's very insightful.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.240]   And he publishes not just every day,
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.840]   but you feel like he's publishing every hour.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.680]   Like if there's a story, he's always on top of it.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.240]   He's on top of it.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.520]   And he also-- I just checked his Twitter page,
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.520]   and it's no longer there.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.320]   And maybe it was somewhere else.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.840]   But he used to have a tagline under his Paris lemon name
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.720]   that said, "Blogger for Life."
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.600]   And that's-- that sums him up pretty good.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.280]   He might have moved from Paris lemon to M.G. Seagler.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.600]   I don't know.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   No, he's still there.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.560]   He's still there, yeah.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.120]   Yeah, he's still there.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.560]   Anyway, I don't know how we got into this.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   I just thought it was--
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.360]   how much is changing?
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.720]   Dwight, you're a good example of somebody
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.680]   who's had to move from news-- and actually, both of you
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.520]   are-- moved from newspaper or a magazine reporter
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.080]   to this new fast-paced world of the blog.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.000]   And it's very different.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.520]   Now, here's a guy who hasn't changed a thing.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.880]   He's just-- he's the same old curmudgeon he always was.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.760]   John C. de Vorak, welcome.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.800]   Hello, everybody.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.160]   John, in a way, you-- I mean, because you wrote so many columns,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.080]   all the-- a column a day at one point, you--
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.320]   in a way were kind of a proto--
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.960]   Do I can do a-- I can do a daily column--
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.760]   Yeah, you're kind of a proto blogger.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.800]   I mean, you were-- and unlike a newspaper guy who had editors
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.160]   in a hierarchy, you've always been kind of--
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.840]   you're on your own.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.040]   Nobody tells John C. de Vorak what to do.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.160]   No, generally.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.520]   I mean, they will kill stuff once in a while.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.440]   Really?
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.000]   Well, it does--
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.560]   Come on.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.200]   Right.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.920]   No, my audience isn't--
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.760]   You know what--
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.520]   You know what-- but it's happened in the past.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.640]   Have you ever had a story where you knew it was a factual,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.880]   but they just didn't have the guts to publish it?
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.960]   No, not really.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.960]   I mean, I've had the incidents where--
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.680]   when I was writing from Forbes, for example,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.720]   which has layers of edits.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.280]   And I actually wrote it for the New York Times freelance articles.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.320]   And you have to sit there with the editor
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.640]   who's going through the database to make sure that your usage is
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.840]   OK that somebody else has done it before.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.800]   I remember doing this one article.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.280]   And I used the term "hitting on" referring
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.760]   to the action at Comdex, where the showgoers were
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.120]   hitting on the booth babes.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.400]   And so the editor and I are going, oh, hitting on hitting.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.680]   I don't know if that can be used.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.360]   That's very colloquial.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.640]   So she goes into the database and says, oh,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.080]   Benanza, Frank Rich has used the term, you're good.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.760]   Validated by Frank Rich.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.680]   But I wonder who's checking Frank Rich.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.320]   I guess nobody at some point.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.760]   He could say whatever he wants.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.480]   He could do whatever.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:27.840]   He could do whatever.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.720]   Like a definitive guy.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.600]   If he writes hitting on, they put it in.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.360]   There is an online newspaper just checking
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.120]   to see if I could find the link, because Jeff Jarvis had this.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.160]   There's a newspaper that's now online that
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.800]   puts at the bottom of every story a correction form.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.400]   I've seen this.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.320]   So that-- I mean, how do you feel about that as a writer?
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.000]   I mean, it seems to me that's actually
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.160]   a good use of the web, right?
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:54.720]   Insta-themed.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.280]   I think it sucks.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.040]   You don't like that.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.520]   No, I don't think we have to do bookkeeping.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.240]   These are articles like the guys just said a minute ago.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.960]   You're writing.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.880]   You don't have all these layers of edit.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.040]   Now we're going to be bookkeepers and keep-- oh, I use the instead
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.480]   of "uh" and I used "an" instead of "a."
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.920]   I mean, where does it end?
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.640]   I mean, I've gotten to arguments about this.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.120]   The great thing about the web is you made a mistake.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   You change it.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.120]   Right.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.120]   All those--
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.320]   I don't want to make whether it's documented that the earlier
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.040]   version 10 minutes ago was a little different
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.120]   or had a different wordage.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.720]   This happens in the newspaper business
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.000]   with the three star and the Bulldog edition.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.920]   They don't put necessarily-- they will change an article.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.960]   Yeah, if somebody is defamed and they have to put a correction,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.360]   this person is not a pervert.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.840]   We're sorry we said that.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.240]   But the fact of the matter is, when you go from one edition
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.320]   to the other, you don't say what you've changed.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.360]   That's because sometimes the story is not even in the second
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.440]   edition.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.200]   I don't like it.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.640]   Comments under a story are de facto--
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.120]   Exactly.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120]   --correction forms.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   Absolutely.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.120]   Exactly.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.240]   And so one of the reasons why they may be doing that
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.400]   is to keep the correction stuff out of the comments.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.640]   That may be like a diffusion mechanism
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.480]   to keep corrections about wording and so forth out of there.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   But one of the things--
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   So I--
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.280]   --if you're a good--
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.000]   I've talked to editors about this,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and that's not the reason they're doing it.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.560]   They're doing it because they think they need--
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.400]   they need to be on their record that a mistake,
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.800]   whether you're an error and punctuation was made.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.240]   Do the comments-- do the corrections show up automatically?
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.800]   Or they vetted first?
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.600]   I don't know.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.800]   I'm trying to find this link in I can't.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   I don't know.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   I can't find it.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   It's an interesting--
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.480]   I know what they don't like this idea.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.280]   I stand not corrected, says John C. de Wora.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.240]   Certainly, if you make a mistake, you'll see it in the comments,
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.360]   and I think that's probably good enough.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   Man, there's a lot of places they turn up the comments
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.760]   because they don't want to face this challenge, right?
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.280]   Look, no matter what, it's a difficult transition from this--
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.840]   Stephen Levy says, I do slow journalism, like slow food.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.240]   That's the new slow food movement.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.440]   He says, I do slow journalism.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.960]   And he does because his books take--
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.120]   his most recent book took seven years.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.120]   So that's really slow journalism.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.480]   You know, a lot of--
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.000]   I was listening to one of the sports talk shows
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.560]   that they have a couple of writers that talk to each other
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.160]   pardon the interruption.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.520]   And the one of them said that he
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.560]   hates to sell idea of blogging and putting stuff out
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.360]   there without editors going over it
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.640]   and other editors going over it.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.840]   He's just not used to that.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.840]   He doesn't like the idea.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.320]   And he doesn't want to do it.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.040]   And I can see people getting into that.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.200]   But it's being too dependent on your editors.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.760]   The weird thing about this is that writers,
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.360]   I think, genetically, complain bitterly.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.720]   I always did, even when I was an editor.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.680]   But writers complain bitterly about editors dominating
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.400]   everything, and they're ruining their copy
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.680]   and ruining their jokes and doing all these bad things.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.040]   And then they're given the opportunity
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.000]   to do this straight up writing without a bunch of middlemen.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.920]   And then they won't do it.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.640]   They complain.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.360]   Well, what about fact checking, though?
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.000]   I mean, you know, the New Yorkers
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.560]   are famous for its very high quality fact checking
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.000]   on even the silliest little trivial details.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.600]   And I think that that's what this newspaper
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.800]   that Jeff was talking about was using this form for,
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.040]   is a fact check form.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.600]   Do you think that's an inappropriate use?
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.880]   I'm not talking about punctuation,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.640]   but just saying, hey, that's incorrect.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.440]   I think that, ultimately, if you have good readers,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.640]   but like Dwight said, if you have a comments field
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.000]   and smart readers, they will fact check you better
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.680]   than any professional fact checker could ever.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.360]   I agree.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.840]   Because no matter how big a single fact checker is,
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.160]   they have to call other people and verify things.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.440]   And if you have thousands of readers,
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.680]   you have experts on everything.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.600]   And my readers, certainly, when I get something wrong,
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.240]   usually within a couple of minutes,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.520]   they chastise me and correct me.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   I agree.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.400]   I think that, well, I am far from perfect
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.600]   and I get things wrong all the time.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.160]   Because we have this active chat room
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.560]   and this active participation,
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.160]   I think we almost always get it right eventually.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.200]   And let me say something about fact checking.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.360]   And I think the guys will back me up on this
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.080]   if they've done any writing for the National Press.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.800]   When I started off, fact checkers were everywhere,
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.600]   especially throughout the 1980s.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.400]   By the time the 1980s ended,
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.560]   and the collapse had already begun,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.880]   and really before the web,
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.240]   the newspapers and magazine collapse had begun,
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.920]   thanks to television, mostly.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.040]   The fact checkers were the first guys to get fired.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.560]   It's like firing the makeup people at tech TV.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   They were the first to go.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.560]   Yeah, they were.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.560]   And the result is, as you see, not far from salubrious.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.160]   And at some point, there were no fact checking.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.800]   There was no, the editors would do a little minor fact checking
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.760]   and say, you know, I don't remember this.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.480]   But there used to be serious fact checking
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.280]   where they would go out and call people.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.320]   And that died at least 20 years ago.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.160]   I found the link.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.800]   This is Jay Rosen, actually,
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.960]   put this on his Twitter.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.280]   And it's the Litchfield County, Connecticut,
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.320]   registered citizens.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.520]   So it's a very small local paper.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.800]   But they say since launching an easy to use online fact check
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.160]   form in May, readers have made well over 100 reports to us
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.680]   about local news stories that contain incorrect information,
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.560]   lacked context to the point of being misleading or missed,
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.880]   quote, the real point and, quote, of the story altogether.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.600]   That's pretty interim for a small paper,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.480]   a small town paper that cannot afford a fact checker
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.120]   or probably even very good editors.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.520]   That's probably not a bad idea.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.560]   Well, this again is misleading because nobody has fact checkers
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.040]   anymore.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.760]   Right.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.400]   So nobody--
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.480]   So do they have comments under their story?
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.080]   Yes, they do.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.680]   But they also have a special form.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.120]   And I think you're probably right, Dwight,
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.000]   that this was just to get the fact checking out of the comments
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.760]   and into a fact check form that says,
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.360]   tell us what was wrong title or article email address.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.960]   I think it's kind of to separate about.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.160]   Yeah, I don't think that's a bad thing.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.240]   But I think you're right.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.480]   I think, Harry, the comments, really,
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.880]   that's what comments ultimately do so well, is balance an article.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.760]   There are still a few fact checkers out there.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.560]   I just recently started writing for time.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.800]   And for online, for time.com, I am my own fact checker.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.960]   But I have something in the print issue this coming week.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.440]   And there are fact checkers involved when it goes on paper
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:06.880]   at time.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.120]   I also wrote something for Discover recently
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.440]   and got fact checked for that as well.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.680]   But I have to say, I laid off the fact checkers at PC World
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.600]   quite a long time ago.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.040]   So John is quite right.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.760]   I don't know how many cases they went away a long time ago.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.000]   And they were fact checking is dangerous.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.120]   Because if you know somebody is going to be checking every fact
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   for you, you might get sloppy.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.960]   If you know you're working without a mat,
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.600]   you're ultimately more likely to get things right in the lesson
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:30.960]   list.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.240]   A lot of TKs in there.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.280]   TK, TK.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:34.600]   That means--
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.560]   I don't think PC World got massively more inaccurate
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.720]   once we started telling the editors and the writers
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.040]   that it actually was their responsibility to be correct,
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.200]   which kind of was not the message we gave them
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.520]   when we had a couple of fact checkers on staff.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.000]   I tell you what.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.280]   Yeah, I think he's right, which is a reverse effect
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.640]   that you'd expect it to get worse when it actually gets better.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.080]   And it didn't hurt that Google and the internet
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.400]   came along and can be kind of a quasi--
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.560]   because sometimes you'll--
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.440]   the real danger isn't so much like you're writing something up
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.640]   in a field that maybe there's a couple of things
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.280]   you don't know about.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.760]   You can look it up on Google.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.600]   And then you can actually fact check yourself
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.720]   by looking it up again.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.600]   In other words, following more than one source.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.120]   The real problem, and the problem I've always had occasionally,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.840]   rare, but it happens to every writer.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.880]   You swear you knew a fact to be solid
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.640]   and you don't even think the fact check it because you're--
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.520]   the guy's name is spelled with a B.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.800]   And there's no B in his name.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.120]   I do that all the time.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.440]   Of course, I'm live.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.800]   So it's always a thought process.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.040]   So and sometimes I'll hedge my statements
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.440]   if I'm not sure of it.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.160]   But if I'm sure of it, I'll emphasize it.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.720]   And that's very easily bites you in the ass.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.640]   Yeah, it happens.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.680]   And of course, you'll find out about it pretty quickly
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.440]   in the comments and you scramble to correct it.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.400]   And of course, the good gag, I don't know if Dwight ever does.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.880]   I do this on the blog occasion.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.200]   It's kind of funny.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.480]   You get somebody with a long-winded explanation
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.600]   of why something is wrong in the blog posting,
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.200]   and you go back and change it, and then you do nothing else.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.040]   So this is a dirty trick that bloggers do constantly.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   And then there's the guy who has the comment,
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.640]   he looks like an idiot because does it reflect
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.720]   what the post looks like?
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.640]   And then there's what Molly Wood calls the literal net.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.640]   Well, now I'm sorry in episode 232 of Star Trek.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.440]   It was very obvious that the nuts and bolts
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.120]   were all screwed from left to right, not right to left.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.560]   You should've known that.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.920]   Oh, I think it's good to give your commenters credit
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.720]   because it gives them some props for checking it at all.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.800]   So they may come in and be, you know,
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.760]   come at you kind of angry and with a chip on their shoulder.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.000]   And then when you correct it and say,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.440]   hey, thanks, I appreciate you keeping me honest
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.640]   or leaving me the right information, they kind of go, oh.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.120]   I mostly do that, Dwight, except every once in a while,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.880]   there's like, you know what, you would define as an a-hole.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.720]   (laughs)
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.560]   And you don't really--
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.560]   A-troll, a-hole.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.560]   A-hole, a-hole.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.400]   A-hole, a-hole, a-hole.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.120]   That you don't really think--
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.440]   I know, but Dwight's right.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.320]   You can almost always turn an a-hole to a friend if you--
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.480]   It depends.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.480]   Handle them.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.000]   There are guys that are permanent a-holes online.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.480]   They're very obvious.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.320]   (laughs)
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.160]   And we know it.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160]   (laughs)
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.800]   The only reason I bring this up is because I wonder
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.280]   if we're better off or worse off.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.600]   In this new, you know, I can tell you who's worse off
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.880]   is the reporter who works for a blog
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.760]   who's just like busting his, you know,
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.000]   not all the time, probably for very little pay.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.840]   But as--
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.680]   Harry's got it right.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.280]   You do the stories that people really care about.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.080]   You don't just do something necessarily
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.880]   'cause you have to be on top of it.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.880]   You know, I have editor duties as well as writer duties
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.560]   and some management duties.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.320]   And so I can't do every story.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.200]   So I try to pick very carefully a tech blog
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.240]   ones that I think the majority of people will be interested in
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.320]   or that are generally are just the most interesting.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.280]   And Harry does the same thing.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.040]   You know, he focuses on the writing
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.680]   and does a lot more--
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   Well, that's true.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.440]   And in a world where information is kind of
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.480]   of less value to base because it's so widely available,
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.920]   it becomes what's valuable is judgment, perception, choice.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.560]   Is editing.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.400]   Right.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.360]   And that's one reason why I do my link posts.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.120]   The link posts are kind of the,
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.040]   here's everything that happened, you know,
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.600]   in the tech news.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.320]   And you can come here and find people
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.800]   who are writing in detail about it
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.760]   and probably are smarter about it than I am.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.920]   And then I'll pick one or two and focus on those.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.720]   And I think that's kind of, you know,
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.360]   it's the Jeff Jarvis, you know,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.280]   do what you do best and link to the rest.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.120]   Right.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.280]   For the last few months I've been doing a lot of posts
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.960]   which are maybe one to three sentences long.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.720]   I noticed they're just there to hand off the reader
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.600]   to somebody who's done something that's long and interesting
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.120]   and says it at least as well as I ever could.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.440]   And that works really well.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.240]   My posts tend to be either really short
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.400]   and simply say here's something fun elsewhere.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.720]   Go read or I'll do hundreds of words and a lot of cases.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.920]   That's what blogs used to be, right?
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.520]   Is link really collections of links.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.920]   And it's really liberating to know
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.920]   that you don't need to try to do everything.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.840]   You just need to do the things where you actually
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.040]   you can add value.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.880]   Right.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.200]   And other than that, just hand people off.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.440]   We're gonna talk about the new Windows phone.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.200]   Harry was there, you were at the event
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.720]   and also a big Facebook event.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.040]   There's been a lot going on this week.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.360]   There's lots to talk about.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.520]   I'm so glad we've got this panel.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.360]   What a prestigious panel of experts here, Harry McCracken,
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.040]   former editor-in-chief of PCWorld now at technologyizer.com.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.680]   Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.280]   and the tech blog at blogs.cron.com.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.120]   John C. Devorek, who is, of course, John C. Devorek.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.080]   And you need real introduction.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.920]   What were you doing there?
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.240]   Was that a little hand gesture?
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.600]   Yeah, okay.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.800]   - Aye, captain.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.920]   - Aye, aye, captain.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.680]   Before we go on though, I do wanna talk a little bit
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.680]   about our friends at Carbonite
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.920]   and their creation, their new creation,
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.960]   Carbonite Pro for small business.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.160]   If you are a small business
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.920]   and you do not have a disaster plan,
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.560]   you are headed for disaster.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.000]   Let's face it, think about all that data
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.080]   you've got on the computers in your office.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.640]   The bookkeeping, the client lists,
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.960]   all of those things, what would happen
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.680]   if the office burned down and you lost it all?
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.400]   You got backups right next to the original computers.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.840]   Those are gone too.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.280]   You gotta have offsite backup.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.240]   But on the other hand, offsite backup
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.240]   requires a lot of attention
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.080]   and perhaps an IT professional.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.600]   This is where Carbonite Pro is so great.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.880]   Carbonite uses the great consumer technology
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.800]   developed for Carbonite,
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.840]   but puts it in a business environment.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.240]   With Carbonite, you have unlimited backup per computer.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.440]   And in fact, it turned out a lot of people
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.760]   were using that for their businesses.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.000]   Carbonite Pro is designed around the idea
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.480]   of kind of as many users as you want.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.400]   You only pay for the storage that you need.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.040]   A better solution for business.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.960]   It's offsite, it's automatic.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.040]   Your individual users can restore their data
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.120]   from Carbonite Pro, not just by
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.480]   from the original computer as with most backups,
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.560]   but from any computer.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.840]   Any time you get online, you log into your account.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.680]   There's your data.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.440]   You can even use a free iPhone and Blackberry app.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.280]   It's secure, uses AES-256-spid encryption if you choose
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.160]   to protect your privacy.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.680]   Of course, SSL is always used during backup.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.280]   So even if you have an open access point,
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.480]   you don't have to worry about it.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.720]   And the price is right.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.680]   20 gigabytes, $10.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.800]   100 gigabytes, $75 a month.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.600]   So you could have 100 desks each with two gigabytes,
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.800]   each it costs you no more than $100 to backup.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   I mean, that's remarkable.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.440]   Very affordable, very effective.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.320]   It's online backup for your small business.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.520]   And it's very important.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.880]   If you don't have a strategy, try it free
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.480]   for 30 days right now.

[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   It is an absolutely vital solution.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.000]   Windows Mobile, you were at the announcement, Harry.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.160]   I heard you ask a question, I think, yes.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.000]   It tried.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.160]   Actually, I think you heard me at the Facebook.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.760]   Facebook, I was at the Bingo that, which was also last week.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.600]   But I also went to New York to the Windows Phone 7.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.120]   You've been getting all around.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.960]   That's great.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.800]   So which should we start with?
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   Which do you think is more important?
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.560]   Windows Phone 7 or Bing Facebook?
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.840]   Well, to me, Windows Phone 7 is fascinating
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.400]   just because it actually is new.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.760]   And in Vendo, it's not a wannabe.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.480]   It's not just a carbon copy of the iPhone or Android.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.640]   But it's also getting into the game rather late.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.880]   At least it seems to be getting in later.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.840]   I think we're probably still ultimately really early
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.600]   in the history of smartphones.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.520]   And I'm just really curious how easy it is for anybody
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.880]   to get traction with a new platform.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.320]   I actually think it's quite good from a user interface
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.800]   standpoint.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.040]   It's, to me, better than Android.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.720]   And I can certainly see somebody walking into a phone store.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.760]   And it's not implausible that somebody
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:01.480]   might prefer this user interface to the iPhone.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.400]   But Microsoft was kind of a sleeper
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.480]   that we all for years.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.240]   And it's kind of, in a worst case scenario,
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.320]   it's kind of like the Zoom all over again.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.240]   Zoom was always a good product a year
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.120]   after you wanted that.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.080]   So they came up with a hard drive player.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.000]   Once the world had moved on to Flash, and a Flash player,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.200]   once the world had moved on to touch screens,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.480]   and a touch screen player with no apps when the world had
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   moved on to apps.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.680]   And that's the worst case scenario.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.680]   But the best case scenario is that there still
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.080]   is room for at least a third major platform.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.120]   What do you think?
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.400]   Yeah, John's a fan.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.840]   I can tell John's not impressed.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.120]   What do you think?
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.600]   I've thought about this phone for a while.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.200]   I mean, I think it's probably a great phone.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.400]   The problem is I think Harry's kind of touched on it,
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.800]   which is the--
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.240]   they're asleep at the wheel.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.440]   They're way behind all the other players.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.240]   It's a little--
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   You've had a very low--
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.200]   It looks a little clunky.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.280]   You've had a very low opinion of Microsoft's ability
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   to innovate for some time now.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.400]   No, it's almost forever.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.040]   It's just they start using the word innovate.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   John, have you actually tried using the word innovate?
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.280]   That was the giveaway.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.320]   Have you tried it?
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:12.760]   Sorry?
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.120]   Have you tried it?
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.360]   No, I haven't gotten a hold of one yet.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.400]   I'm going to try to.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.960]   I'm sure it's fine.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.960]   It's just that as a phone, and I'm sure
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.200]   it does everything you want it to do.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.960]   There's probably a few gotchs.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.320]   I'm not more than a little amused by the fact
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.000]   that it hasn't got cut and paced, which
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.040]   seems to have been the main complaint about the iPhone
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.880]   when it first came out.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.360]   And the people harped and harped and harped on cut
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.520]   and paste, cut and paste.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.240]   Here we are, what?
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.840]   Four years later, Microsoft brings out a phone
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.120]   with no cut and paste.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.560]   Well, they were great pains at the announcement to say, well,
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.280]   we'll have it early 2011.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.400]   Right, and they bring it out now.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.320]   How hard can it be?
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:48.960]   Good question.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.920]   I don't know.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.360]   What do you think, Dwight?
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.320]   Well, it's-- one of the things that Microsoft has said
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.960]   about Windows Phone mobile-- Windows Phone 7
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.680]   is that there's a huge number of people yet who have not
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.560]   picked up on smartphones.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:10.040]   And they see this as allure to aimed at people who are still
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.160]   using feature phones.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.000]   The problem is that they're still marketing it
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.480]   with the pricing that is typical of Android and the iPhone.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.440]   It's still going to be a $200 phone
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.400]   and have the various data plans.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.920]   And one of the reasons people are still holding off
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.760]   and holding on to their feature phones
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.640]   is that they don't have those added costs.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.280]   And I think if Microsoft really wanted
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.360]   to lure that huge base of people who haven't bit yet,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.600]   they would lower the price both of the hardware
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.800]   and work with the carriers to make the data plans less.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.120]   I've tried Windows Phone 7, and I really like it.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.320]   I think it has-- it's very, very appealing.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.200]   And Microsoft now understands that part of the appeal
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.400]   of a smartphone is not just what it does,
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.320]   but kind of there's an emotional appeal to it.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.960]   So it has almost a sense of whimsy and a very-- much
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.400]   a friendliness that was completely missing
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.160]   from the really geeky Windows mobile 6.5, which
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.960]   was real computer-y.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.680]   This is very attractive.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.840]   And I think the masses are going to really be interested.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.720]   How do I disagree with that?
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.000]   But how does it compare to the--
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.200]   To the Kin, the US phone.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.720]   Kin, yeah.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.360]   Oh, it's amazing that the same company
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.000]   came out with both products in the same year.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.720]   The Kin was just totally out of contact
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.280]   and out of touch with anything anybody would want.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.480]   And Windows Phone 7 is way better than that.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.000]   And I can't quite see where they couldn't figure out
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.760]   that it was not worth doing the Kin.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.240]   And they should have just put even more effort
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.480]   into getting Windows Phone 7 out quickly.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.840]   Harry and Dwight correct me.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.920]   This was my impression.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.400]   I haven't touched it yet, but just looking
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.200]   at what I've seen and looking at the ads.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.000]   It looked like one thing that was very different from Android
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.760]   and iPhone was that it's not so app-centric.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.000]   Android and iPhone, really, you live in the apps.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.320]   You don't do anything that's not inside an app.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.280]   It looked like Windows Phone 7--
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.000]   of course, they don't have as many apps.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.160]   But it looked like the operating system was very much more
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.840]   foreground.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.480]   A little bit, I mean, they integrate with Facebook
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.360]   and your contacts from various places.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.600]   And you can check status updates and so forth.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.760]   Or without an app.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.360]   It's all just a tile, right?
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.280]   Which Kin also did.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.640]   I mean, the challenge there is it's
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.840]   hard to be as good at doing Facebook as Facebook
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.480]   is at doing Facebook.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.400]   And I think Microsoft has said they're not doing this
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.240]   instead of apps.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.520]   They're doing it just so.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.920]   If you want to get in and get out quickly, which is a line
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.120]   they've used a lot, you don't need to launch the app.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.200]   And that was the big pitch.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.920]   In fact, let me show a little bit of one of the ads
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.200]   for the new Windows Phone 7.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.040]   These ads feature people staring into their phone
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.680]   and kind of missing out on life.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.680]   Here's a guy at the beach, a girl in the shower, a woman
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.920]   running, a massage therapist who's looking at her phone
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.960]   instead of a massage.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.440]   A guy who's on a seesaw and his poor kid's stranded,
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.400]   a woman saying, look at me.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.560]   And her boyfriend is busy looking at the phone.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.240]   And the shark's coming.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.440]   And he doesn't know.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.360]   And then he drops the phone in the urine oil.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.120]   Really?
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.200]   He's on a roller coaster.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.720]   She runs into somebody.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.200]   He sits on somebody.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.760]   She walks into somebody.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.720]   She falls down the stairs.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.480]   He's at a wedding.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.800]   But she isn't.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.960]   Surgeons looking at phones.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.960]   Really?
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960]   Really?
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   Yes.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:30.360]   It's time for a phone to save us from our phones.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.560]   I think this is a--
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.480]   Very odd campaign.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.040]   End out.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.960]   Well, you know, like you said--
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.240]   I actually did a column about this ad.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.720]   And like you said, Leo.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.240]   And I quoted you in this column.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.160]   You should pay more attention.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   The--
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.280]   I quoted you in this column saying only Microsoft
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.640]   would highlight its competition in an advertisement.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.200]   Yeah, you don't see--
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.800]   And when does phone in that ad?
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.040]   No, you're just seeing these--
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.960]   but what's really kind of sick about that ad
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.320]   is the fact that Microsoft doesn't recognize
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.000]   that what they're exhibiting in that ad,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.400]   which I believe is true, it's a bunch of people preoccupy
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.520]   with their phones and we see it all the time,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.520]   is that this is a major societal trend.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.120]   They're not going to buck it.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.680]   Because I mean, people aren't using these phones
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.040]   so they could get in and get out and get on with it.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.240]   They're engaged.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.680]   The phone is engaging them.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.040]   It's consuming them.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.320]   That seems like the phone's doing its job.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:24.880]   And the phone--
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.320]   The phone in terms of marketing.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.720]   So Microsoft's missing the point.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:35.040]   The Windows Phone 7 interface is pretty engaging in and of itself.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.320]   And I can see people still walking around like this.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.440]   You know, staring at this phone, it's a lot of fun.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.520]   But what Microsoft is also saying is, you know,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.320]   our phone isn't as interesting as this.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.280]   You'll be glad to stop looking at our phone.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.400]   Yeah, our phone sucks.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.560]   It's basically the message.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.200]   Why don't get it?
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.120]   Why is Microsoft so bad at advertising?
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.400]   I mean, first the churro and then this.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:01.040]   They have no vice president or executive in charge of all--
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.480]   There's no marketing VP.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.840]   There's nobody ahead of marketing.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.280]   There's not anybody you can see.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.120]   There's not like a CMO.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.800]   There's no chief marketing officers.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.120]   There's a bunch of little wannabe marketing people.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.880]   They all have their own little niches.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.640]   There's nobody there.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.680]   They don't know how to market anything.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.280]   On the other hand, I think that this will resonate with people.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.160]   They're everybody sick of the morons walking in front of traffic
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.800]   because they're so looking at their phone.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.840]   I mean, that is also a cultural phenomenon.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.880]   Maybe they've decided, well, this is so annoying.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.600]   We're going to buck the trend.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.560]   Stupid.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.800]   I think they are catering to non-phone geeks.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.880]   I mean, if you look at the percentage of Americans who
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.920]   have smartphones even today, a pretty high percentage of them
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.600]   are people who are kind of tech nerds.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.920]   And Dwight's right, they're going to have to convince people
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.440]   to spend $200 plus $80 or whatever a month,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.040]   which for a lot of people is still a pretty high price tag.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.600]   But I think they are looking at the great,
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.840]   untapped market of people who aren't just
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.520]   not doing this at all yet.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.000]   But that's an interesting market to go after.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.080]   That's the market that's using a phone with a dial pad on it.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.280]   No, but they're using--
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.800]   A regular old-fashioned cheap phone.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.280]   They're using phones like a cold-throw weapon.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.440]   Yeah, they're using razor phones.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.680]   They don't want these phones.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.200]   Pre-free.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.040]   So is that, in a way, Microsoft's saying,
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.160]   well, we really can't compete against the Android and iPhone.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.080]   So we're going to go after the unwashed masses who don't know
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:21.880]   that phone.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.800]   I am reminded of a story.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.240]   So my all-time favorite product was this product
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.760]   that WordStar came out with, which was
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.880]   Kat some crummy name is Easy Word.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.600]   I can't remember the exact name of the product.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   But it was just a brain dead word processor
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.440]   that was just a horrible piece of crap.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.640]   And I asked them about what their marketing theory was
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.160]   on this.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.400]   Well, who's going to buy it?
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.080]   This is-- this product is designed
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.280]   for people who don't like computers
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.920]   and don't like word processing.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   Great.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.040]   And you can see the logic.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.600]   I was just like dumbfounded that way.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.200]   So in other words, you want to sell it to people
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.720]   that probably don't even have a computer.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.520]   You're trying to sell it to people who don't want it.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.920]   And no, it wasn't WordStar 2000.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.960]   It was called Easy Word.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.160]   It had some stupid name.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.760]   Well, we don't remember it, obviously.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.880]   Well, I can write written about it.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.920]   So Microsoft's trying to sell a smartphone to people
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.440]   who don't want smartphones.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.240]   I think they are.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.800]   But I mean, to be fair, I think that this platform does
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.000]   stand as a shot at being competitive.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.800]   It certainly is not overly dumb down.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.000]   They are still catching up.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.120]   They don't have cut and paste.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.280]   It looks sexy to me.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.280]   And I'm not offended by these.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.080]   They don't have multitasking for third-party apps.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.320]   But I can see people are pretty serious about phones
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.160]   finding this appealing, especially if they ramp up
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.080]   the third-party apps pretty quickly.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.960]   So there are nine models.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.640]   I do have to give Microsoft a little bit of a hard time
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.480]   because they-- I don't know what it looked like there.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.040]   I was watching the stream, Harry.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.840]   But they had a hatch open up on the stage.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.360]   Yes.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.960]   And then a table kind of shakily--
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.200]   Rolling this table up in front of Steve Bomber.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.720]   And then it kind of stops and kind of vibrates to a halt.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.160]   And there's nine phones in front of him.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.840]   By the way, Leo, can I stop you for a second?
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.680]   I think your coverage of this event was--
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.240]   to be honest about it, it was Pulitzer quality.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.680]   And I'm not kidding.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.200]   It's that you had the whole event.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.200]   You had commentary, running commentary,
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.560]   while the event was going on.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.480]   I thought it was a beautiful piece.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.240]   Thank you.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.040]   And there was-- there was a lot of people watching it.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.760]   But I don't think a lot of people appreciated that what you did,
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.240]   the way you did it, was absolutely outstanding.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.200]   I want to give you some--
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:28.720]   Thank you.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.320]   It was very nice of you.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.800]   This is kind of how we want-- look,
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.400]   this is where I want to take the network, which is live coverage
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.560]   of breaking events.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.960]   We've never covered a Microsoft event yet.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.000]   So I thought, well, I'll get up.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.840]   I don't know why they had it at 9.30 Eastern times, 6.30
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.520]   Microsoft time in the morning.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.840]   But I was there, Harry.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.320]   Obviously, he took it even more seriously.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:46.760]   He flew out.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.040]   Had I known Harry, I would have gotten you on, because it was--
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.120]   but this is how I think we'd like to do this from now.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.400]   And I'll probably do it on Wednesday with the Apple coverage,
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.680]   which is kind of the Mystery Science Theater 2000 coverage,
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.520]   which is we're just sitting in the audience watching and snarking.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.200]   That was funny.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:02.960]   Yeah, it was fun.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.240]   And I think it is-- the idea is that you get to watch the event.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.000]   And of course, if you want to watch the event,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.120]   you can watch the stream clean.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.000]   You don't need us.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.520]   But to get some background as you're watching the event--
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.160]   so that's our goal.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.040]   I don't know if it was the best thing we've ever done.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:16.960]   But I think that is where we--
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.240]   It's one of the-- I really enjoyed it.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.520]   Thank you, John.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.200]   So Leo, on Wednesday, there's the Apple event, the Mac--
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.240]   --back to the Mac event that they're going to do.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.000]   And I haven't heard if they're live streaming that or not.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.560]   Do you know?
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.200]   I don't know.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:31.960]   I hope they do.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.480]   That looks not good.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.520]   They did the last one.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.560]   They did the last one.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.840]   Which I think was a response to the fact
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.720]   that the room is full of live bloggers.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.280]   And you just might as well--
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.160]   I mean, Apple, I think the idea for Apple was initially.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.440]   They did stream initially, then they stopped a few years ago.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   And I think their idea was, we want to control it
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.960]   so that when we put out the video, it's nicely produced.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.600]   And then they realized we can't control it
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.720]   because there's too many live bloggers doing it anyway.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.320]   And then there's this moron Leo, who actually turned his laptop
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.600]   around and streamed it.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.240]   So we better just stream it ourselves.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.080]   Kind of create it.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:03.880]   I don't think you're streaming.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.720]   I do too.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   When they don't stream it, the most important thing I do
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.840]   is kind of TDS, which is to report price tags and exact specs
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.880]   and so forth, which is kind of boring.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.960]   I'd much rather that Apple took care of that stuff
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.480]   and that I could do commentary and analysis and the stuff
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.240]   you're not going to get otherwise.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.400]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.280]   So you'll sit in the audience.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.320]   You're one of the live bloggers.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.120]   You'll sit in the audience.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:29.920]   You'll live blog it.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.520]   And people will refresh technologizer over and over again.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.440]   They don't have to.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.640]   I use CoverIt Live.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.040]   I love CoverIt Live.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.160]   You just come along and the stuff slides by.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.040]   Although it broke down during the iPad announcement, didn't it?
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.720]   Yes.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.520]   Yeah, hopefully that was a learning experience for them.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.840]   I've had good luck with that sense.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.760]   They had so many people using CoverIt Live.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.040]   So live blogging, you know, gadget does it and gadget.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.200]   Does it Gizmoda?
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:55.840]   Does it Harry?
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.040]   Does it so?
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.200]   What I do is I like it a dashboard of them and all.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.600]   And that's what we'll do on Wednesday.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.040]   I have Andy and Akko is actually in the event.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.400]   Alex, Lindsey, Tom, Merritt, and I
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.440]   will be sitting in the studio.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.560]   Either there'll be a stream, which, you know, when we didn't--
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.160]   we asked Apple for permission to re-broadcast the stream
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.560]   of what we did with Microsoft.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.960]   And they said, no.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.400]   So what we did is we kind of watched
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.360]   and hoped that others were watching the stream
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.280]   and then listening to us, you know,
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.320]   doing their own mix down of the two.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.560]   So we'll either do that or we'll watch Harry
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.160]   and we'll report what Harry's saying.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.000]   And then we'll do Mac Break Weekly right after.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.640]   I don't think this one is not at Erbobuina Center.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.280]   It's not at Moscone West.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   It's at one infinite loop in the town hall, which only holds,
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.600]   I think, 250, 350 people.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.880]   So it's a small event.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.560]   As usual, Apple gets a ton of press.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.760]   You know, Microsoft and Facebook and Cisco,
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.200]   all three of them had events.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.880]   Was it on Monday?
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.720]   All three of them had-- or when was it Wednesday?
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.720]   It was one day when everybody had an event.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.600]   And nobody knew these events ahead of time.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.880]   There was no buzz.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.240]   Apple, all they have to do is send an invitation out
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.440]   to 150 people one week before.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.040]   And the whole blogosphere is a buzz with--
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.120]   They're complete idiots.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:11.960]   Let's face reality.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.800]   You think they're idiots?
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.640]   I think they're great.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.280]   They're getting all this free press.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.520]   No, I'm talking about these guys
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.600]   that nobody knows about the events.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   Oh, you guys who don't do the Microsoft, the Apple.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.880]   Yeah, they're missing a bet.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.880]   Yeah, no, they're idiots.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.600]   The other guys, yeah, no, Apple,
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.200]   you can't criticize them for anything.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.440]   They're like geniuses.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.760]   They send an invitation out that has an Apple
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.800]   and a little lion peeking around the corner.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.480]   And that's all they say.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.400]   That's all they need to say.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.640]   And everybody's going, well, I think
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.320]   they're going to do a touchscreen air.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.000]   Yeah, I know it gets nothing but ink of speculation ink.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.880]   It's unbelievable.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:49.040]   Is there a potential negative because if all they're doing
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.720]   is releasing details about an operating system that won't
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   be out for six months, and if that's all they do,
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.360]   is there a backlash?
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.600]   It hasn't happened yet.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.000]   Hey, by the way, though, can I just
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.200]   back up a little bit about the Microsoft event,
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.840]   the one that you--
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.880]   Who is that?
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.680]   The AT&T CEO.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   Ralph De La Vega.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:10.200]   Did I find this guy at the little interesting?
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:10.920]   And we did that.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.760]   Hey, now I'm with the AT&T.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.320]   I'm the CEO.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.000]   You think the pencil mustache was that?
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.440]   What the hell was that guy?
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.160]   Hello.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.800]   I am Ralph De La Vega.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.200]   Well, it's interesting because AT&T has already
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.720]   kind of telegraphed that they're going to lose exclusivity
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.280]   of the iPhone sooner or later.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.680]   And I think we all agree.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.840]   It's probably January.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.240]   The Wall Street Journal is basically
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.000]   floating Apple's own leak that Verizon will have the iPhone
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.560]   by then.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.400]   So AT&T's got to play the field now.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.920]   And I think it's interesting that they're
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.600]   the ones who are going to launch the Windows phone.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.640]   They're going to launch the Samsung focus on November 8.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.560]   That's the one, by the way.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.840]   Everybody agrees is the one to get.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.640]   Have you played with that one, guys?
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.840]   I played with all three at the event on Monday.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.400]   There's the focus.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.200]   There's an HTC with slide out Dolby speakers, which is bizarre.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.440]   It's thick and it has surround sound speakers.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.200]   Come on.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.520]   It's a little clunky looking.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.320]   And then there's an LG with a slide out keyboard,
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.960]   although it is kind of unclear to what degree Windows Phone
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.440]   7 is designed for landscape as opposed to portrait mode.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.400]   There are some things that even though the keyboard is
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.600]   horizontal, the user interface is not--
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.480]   Oh, it doesn't rotate around?
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.760]   And in a lot of places it does, but not everywhere
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.600]   you'd want it to be.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.280]   I think you're right.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.920]   The Samsung is the cool one.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.400]   It has an OLED screen.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.400]   So the colors are really intense.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.080]   4-inch.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.440]   AMOLED, super AMOLED.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.200]   Nice big screen.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.920]   It's relatively thin.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.480]   The industrial design looks pretty good.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.160]   That's going to be available first.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.960]   And then I guess the other two will be available later on AT&T.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.520]   T-Mobile also has two models, an HTC model and a Dell model
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.320]   later in November.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.720]   All of them will be $200 with the usual two-year contract
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.920]   on AT&T or T-Mobile.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.800]   No phones for Sprint or Verizon or CDMA,
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.720]   but presumably 2011, right?
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.080]   I think Sprint has said they are doing it.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.720]   And Verizon says they're kind of interested, but no details.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.600]   I think Microsoft has said that Verizon and Sprint will have it.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.120]   Yeah, they're still working on the CDMA technology.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.240]   Next year.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.160]   Now, there's one interesting and kind of funny thing
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.160]   that Microsoft did where they were touting
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.680]   what a good game device this is.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.880]   They're clearly going off.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.880]   Next box live.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   Right.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.400]   And one of the things that they did in some of their marketing
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.440]   was they had the icon for the Angry Birds.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:36.960]   It whoops.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.880]   And Rovio came out and said, nope,
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.320]   we don't have a plan to do an Angry Birds version.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.320]   Now, I talked to Paul Therat about this.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.680]   And he said, well, it was a third party that created this ad.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.800]   And they just snipped out icons without really kind of thinking
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.280]   about it.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.960]   And this is a case where John, you're right.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.080]   A CMO would have been all over this.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.240]   Would have said, wait a minute.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.840]   Do you have permission for these icons or a fact checker, maybe?
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.320]   And Rovio was quick to tweak.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.840]   No.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.320]   But on the other hand, if the phone's a strong platform,
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.040]   that Rovio's already got Angry Birds.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.880]   They, in fact, a huge success Angry Birds for Android.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.120]   It came out this week.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.600]   And they didn't offer it on the--
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.920]   oddly enough, they didn't offer it on the Android marketplace.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.080]   They offered it on the Get Jar marketplace.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.120]   And immediately brought the Get Jar server down.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.680]   So they moved it over to Google's Android marketplace.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.400]   And they're claiming one million downloads of Angry Birds
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.200]   in the first day.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.640]   Did they leave it free on Android marketplace?
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.720]   It's ad supported.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.360]   It's got ad mob ads in it, which I'd
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.120]   prefer to pay at Buck 99 and not have the ads, to be honest.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.560]   But I think they're doing an experiment.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.040]   Because it is not free, but it is ad free on the Apple platform.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.320]   It's free ad supported on the Android platform.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.840]   It's an interesting experiment.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.120]   These guys are pretty sharp.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.880]   They've made a lot of money, too, because they've got an iPad app
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.240]   that's also the number one app on the iPad.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.880]   So all right, let's talk about Facebook and Bing.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.680]   And then, John, you'll be happy to know that Yahoo is for sale again.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.920]   Ooh, you actually wrote about it in a Friday market watch column.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.260]   Kind of.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:11.760]   I know.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.920]   Of course you did.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.960]   But who does the phone get?
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.120]   I think it's becoming a joke.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.240]   It's just kind of like one of those stories
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.000]   that just doesn't die ever.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.320]   But before we get to that, you may smoke them if you've got them, gentlemen, because I
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.600]   want to talk a little bit about Squarespace.com.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.480]   No, you can't smoke.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.480]   You're underage.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.120]   Squarespace.com.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.760]   It's the place where exceptional websites begin.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:42.680]   If you've kind of thought, well, I'd like to try a blog or a web page or maybe you have
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.400]   one, but you're not really thrilled with the service that you're using.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.000]   Perhaps they put ads on your site.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.480]   There's your self-hosting and there's all sorts of security updates that you have to
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.160]   apply and you have to check all the time.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   I want you to take a look at Squarespace.com.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.840]   One of the things that Squarespace does, it's a combination of hosting and software.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:07.480]   So the Squarespace folks, they've got a really sophisticated Java-based hosting solution
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:12.080]   that is just guaranteed to give you bandwidth no matter what happens.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.920]   I've never been able to bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:19.360]   You've aimed all the big guns at the Twit Army at it and nothing.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.280]   But they also have the best content management solution on top of it.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:29.400]   One way to tell how good Squarespace is is to go to the Squarespace.com site, Squarespace.com/Twit
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.520]   and take a look at the examples.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:38.040]   These are sites, both blogs, photography, portfolios, businesses that people have created
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:45.720]   using the Squarespace platform and unlike other solutions, no two Squarespace sites look alike.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:51.240]   You start with their great Squarespace templates but you're completely able to customize so
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:55.040]   that that Squarespace site reflects you.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.000]   This is a photography portfolio I'm showing right now.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.960]   Just fantastic.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.160]   A lot of photographers use Squarespace.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.720]   You start with their beautiful templates.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:10.960]   You can drag and drop so you can make it look without any design, training or background.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.840]   You can make it look fantastic.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.000]   You can add forms.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.840]   You can add portfolios.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:22.360]   Then if you know CSS, if you're a JavaScript or CSS wizard, well the sky is the limit.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.560]   Anything you want to do, you can do.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.120]   I think Squarespace is remarkable.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.280]   I want you to take a look at it.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:32.320]   You could try it free for two weeks and when I say free, there's no obligation, nothing.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.360]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:39.040]   Just go to squarespace.com/twit and right there on the front page you'll see a big button
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.080]   that says "try it for free, no credit card required."
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.680]   All you have to do is name your site, give it a password, an email address in case you
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.920]   forget the password and then do the capture.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.240]   You're done.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.200]   You've now got a Squarespace site and you've got it free for two weeks.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.640]   You can even and I like this, import all the existing data from your site right now if
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.040]   you've got a blog or a website.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.920]   It supports all the major APIs including Moveable Type, WordPress, TypePad and Blogger which means
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.760]   almost any site can be imported right in including all the comments.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.560]   They've got a great iPhone app, makes it really easy to not only post but moderate
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.680]   comments and see your stats.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.560]   Like I can go on and on but I just want you to try it right now.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.760]   Go to squarespace.com, set up a site for free.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:23.840]   If you decide to buy, site start at $12 a month and you'll get 10% off for the life of your
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.360]   site with the offer code "twit."
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.800]   Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional website squarespace.com.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   Use the offer code "twit" to save 10%.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.480]   Really is a great way to do a website.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:41.880]   Our Insight Twit blog is there and almost everybody I know, Sarah Lane, Kevin Rosie
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.120]   all have Squarespace blogs.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.120]   It really is the place to do it.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.120]   All right.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.120]   You were also, Harry.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   In fact, you even asked a question.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:52.160]   That's how I knew you were there at the, it was a surprise.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.840]   We were doing one of our shows and my producer, Eileen Rivera comes running and says, "You
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.480]   know, they're streaming something on the Facebook page with Microsoft."
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.760]   I thought, "Oh my God, is Microsoft bought Facebook?"
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:08.720]   Well, they already have a five percent stake in it.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.080]   This was a Facebook Bing thing.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.640]   Is it a big deal or is it a minor thing?
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.840]   I think it's a medium-sized deal in terms of the benefit now.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:24.520]   If you search on Bing, it will do a module in a lot of cases.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.800]   It shows stuff your friend liked and whatever you searched for.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:33.360]   If you search for cars and your friends have given a thumbs up to articles about cars somewhere,
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.760]   you might see those.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.080]   You'll see restaurant reviews they liked and so forth.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.240]   If you search for a name, it will try to look at your network of friends and their friends
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.480]   to get you the person you were searching for, especially if it's a name that multiple people
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.480]   have.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:54.440]   It's that buzzword social search where your search is applied against your social graph
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:59.160]   your friends and the result that comes out has additional information because of what
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.160]   your friends like and use and so forth.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.000]   I think the long-term potential is more interesting because the better they get at weaving this
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.880]   in to how they figure out whether something is relevant to you, the more interesting it
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.880]   is.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.680]   One thing they talked about that sounds interesting, which they're not doing yet, is if you search
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.760]   for restaurants and they look at Facebook places to know which of your friends have actually
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.520]   checked in at a restaurant.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.280]   They'll say, "Well, if that friend has actually been to that restaurant, they probably know
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.200]   more about it than somebody who hasn't."
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.400]   And so that person's opinion gets more important.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:36.360]   So I find the general idea of integrating social stuff in this search really exciting
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:40.760]   and what they've actually done so far is interesting, but it's not transcendent.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.560]   Any privacy concerns with this?
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.520]   Yes, I mean a lot of the questions in the audience were about that.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:52.120]   It's turned on by default, it's not something you need to opt into, but they kind of do
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:57.640]   a balloon the first five times you go to Bing, let's say we're doing this, and in that balloon,
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:03.120]   there's a one-click opt-out option and you need to be logged into Facebook for it to
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.880]   happen at all and nothing goes the other way.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:10.600]   So Facebook doesn't know anything about your Bing searches, even though Bing knows about
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:14.480]   some of your activities on Facebook.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.680]   This is basically what Facebook has already done with Pandora and Yelp and some other
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.680]   sites, right?
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:23.640]   Yes, instant personalization, which kind of got them into trouble when they launched
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.640]   it a few months ago.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.400]   It was spooked the hell out of me and I noticed that they've made the banners smaller, but
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.120]   when I first went to Yelp, it said, "Hey, Leo, LaPor, would you like to know what your
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.120]   friends like?"
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.120]   And I said, "How do you know it's me?"
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.520]   And who has been doing that too?
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.640]   It's a little creepy.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:43.840]   So when you opt-out, Harry, does it opt you out of seeing your friends or does it opt you
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.600]   out of your Facebook items showing up and being?
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:53.440]   It's opting out of, I believe it's opting out of you seeing the feature and actually that's
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:58.720]   a good question in terms of whether your buddies can see what you liked.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.520]   That would be the bigger one.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:01.520]   I was he concerned.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.800]   I believe you can opt out of that too.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.680]   You might have to do that on Facebook rather than on Bing, but I'm not positive.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:13.200]   One of the things that you know, David, somebody asked is, "Well, if I search for an illness
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.800]   then my friend, my Facebook friends like on the three of these articles come up.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.680]   It's like revealing to me that my Facebook friend has this illness."
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.560]   Well, Mark Zuckerberg was at the Microsoft event.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:31.080]   He said something which to me is correct, which is the act of liking something and Facebook
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.240]   is saying, "I want other people to know about this."
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.760]   So if you want to keep something confidential, don't like it.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   Don't like it.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.760]   And he strikes me as reasonable.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.720]   He made a point saying, "We're not putting anything on Bing that you couldn't find out
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.000]   just by going to Facebook.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.400]   It's only the stuff that people have published publicly for everyone."
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:51.560]   So if you go to Facebook, even if you don't have an account, you can see all this data.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.120]   And it is all about what you're liking.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.960]   And so I think essentially if you don't want people to know what you like, then don't press
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.640]   that like button anywhere on the web and you'll be fine.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.520]   There is a creepy factor though, isn't there?
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.680]   Regardless of, you know, you, Mark can say over and over again, "Well, you know, it's
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.880]   nothing that people don't already see.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.160]   Bing isn't sending us any information."
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.960]   And my rational mind goes, "Okay, so that's fine."
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:19.520]   But there's nevertheless this visceral creepiness that it feels like it knows something about
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.520]   me that it is.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.520]   People are still getting their heads around it.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:25.000]   I mean, also this is a three-way integration because it involves Bing.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.760]   It involves Facebook and it involves all these other sites that have the like button of which
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.880]   obviously there are vast numbers, including technologizers.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:39.520]   So you might be on Bing, which is using Facebook to show you what your friend liked at CNET
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.400]   or Yelp or urban spoon or something.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.760]   And I think that's kind of new.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.200]   The fact is not two-way integration, it's three-way.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.520]   Well, Harry, one of the things that really bothers me about the way Facebook has been
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:55.840]   approaching these new features is that they are always opt out.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.280]   You don't opt into anything.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:01.960]   That was one of the big issues with groups is that you could be pulled into any group
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.560]   and be associated with any group regardless of whether you really wanted to be associated
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.760]   or not.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.840]   And the same thing is true with the thing with Bing.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:17.520]   I think that it's much more socially acceptable to give people immediately the option of whether
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.960]   you want to participate before ultimately pulling them in against their will, what may
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.040]   be against their will.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:29.080]   There's also true with places because your friends can check you into places without asking
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.800]   your permission ahead of time.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.920]   And you're able to opt out of that feature, but it's turned on by default.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:40.360]   What's it that has Facebook ads new stuff fell out, they tend to make you opt out rather
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.360]   not done?
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   Right.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:49.480]   I was not able to find in Facebook settings after groups launched anywhere in the privacy
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:56.480]   settings a link where you can say generally don't let people pull the groups.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   That's kind of where demaure would have brought them to.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.520]   Group is another one that really freaked people out.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:06.880]   And again, Facebook's response is the same, which is, well, only your approved friends
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.120]   can add you to a group.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:12.440]   So you shouldn't have a friend that would do that mischievous thing to you.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:18.480]   It seems it's almost as if Facebook has a view of how you should be using Facebook.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.360]   And as long as you adhere to that view, you're okay.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:27.800]   But should you do something like Jason Calicanis did, which is friend everybody who would ask
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.240]   him up to the limit of 5,000.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.920]   That's how Jason got added to.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:36.920]   And by the way, Mark Zuckerberg as well got added to enamble a group.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.920]   Still hilarious.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.920]   Come on.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.920]   You love that.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.920]   Don't you ever love that.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   Well, that was done by a friend of Mike Aarrington's who set it up just for that purpose to kind
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.360]   of show what would happen.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:52.680]   That was actually set up to do that to make that great gag.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:57.760]   Oh, anyway, I think this is the big issue is that.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:03.760]   There's a little bit of a little tiny bit of a big brother thing going on on Facebook
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:06.840]   where we know what's best.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:11.000]   You know, I keep hearing Mark say things like, well, we know you want to connect and we're
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.080]   just doing what you want.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:18.960]   And that's yeah, Facebook more than most large companies is willing to tick off its users.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:23.280]   I think Mark Zuckerberg is very confident about his vision and he thinks we'll all follow
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.600]   along even if we haven't yet.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.760]   And you know, over and over again, when they really get people upset, they do back pedal
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.400]   a little bit.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:34.760]   But they clearly would rather push the envelope than to do something that nobody is going
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.000]   to get upset over.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.160]   So it's the story that just won't die.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:44.240]   This is from Mashable in the Wall Street Journal AOL and several venture capital firms
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:49.360]   are in talks to buy Yahoo.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.800]   John, you believe it?
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.400]   Well, I believe that I know.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.960]   I mean, I think there's a rumor going.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.280]   There's a couple rumors going around.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.520]   One is, of course, that Microsoft's thinking about it again.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.600]   And another one is that AOL is going to do a deal.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.920]   And the other one is that with some private equity companies are going to buy them up
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.800]   because there were so much money.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.840]   And the whole thing doesn't really sound right when you start really looking at it because
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.880]   who the economy is not what it used to be.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   There's a lot of issues.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.520]   I outlined most of this in that column in market watch and then kind of just walked away
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.520]   from it.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:29.920]   I also think that I don't think it's possible for AOL, which I think the best rumors, AOL
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:35.960]   and Yahoo getting together because it could be called A-Hoo, which would be funny.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:41.920]   So for that reason alone, I think it would be cool.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:47.760]   But the clashes of the culture, I mentioned the fact that both these guys are kind of
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.240]   out of touch with the mainstream, what's really going on.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.360]   They're neither one are considering hip and happening.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.600]   We've done this on this show a number of times.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.320]   You've done it, Leo.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:01.200]   Others have done it that if somebody comes out with an AOL email address, they're seen
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   as losers and out of touch.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:10.640]   And these kind of images, which are plaguing both companies, Yahoo is the company that
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.320]   can't do a buyout of anybody.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.200]   They got a bunch of bonehead companies they bought.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.720]   They don't know what to do with them.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:19.960]   They buy broadcast.com for $3 billion and they drop the ball on that.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:24.880]   I mean, these are not, I don't see that these are not cherries waiting to be plucked.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:29.000]   Either one of these companies, they're kind of all fashioned.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.120]   But let's not forget that Yahoo is publicly held.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:35.440]   The investors were, I think, a little perturbed that Jerry Yang did not sell to Microsoft.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.720]   They wanted that $31 a share or whatever.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.280]   Yeah, which also is another mistake they made.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   They could have gotten out of smelling like a rose.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:50.320]   Although I stick to my original thinking, which is this never would have gotten past the Justice
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.320]   Department.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.320]   Right.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.320]   Well, I guess, yeah, it does depend.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:58.240]   Although AOL and Yahoo right now are really content companies.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.200]   That's, I mean, Yahoo doesn't even do its own search anymore.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.240]   Bing does the search.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.800]   So they're aggregators of blogs of content.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.440]   Isn't that what AOL has become?
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.240]   AOL, I don't think so much with Yahoo.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.480]   Well, I don't know.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.080]   OMG, look at all the properties of Yahoo.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.080]   Lots of grooves.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.080]   TV.com.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.080]   Oh, I'm GV.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.080]   TechCrunch now.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:26.920]   Well, when did AOL get the purchasing power to even think about buying Yahoo?
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:28.560]   I mean, they were in the money.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:29.560]   It'd be leveraged.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.560]   These are an e-mail.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.560]   These are floundering companies.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.560]   They get lots of floundering companies.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:38.600]   And it'd be like tying two drowning people together and hope that together they can swim.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:42.960]   So here's a, maybe a more credible story that came out in Bloomberg.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.720]   What do you mean more credible?
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:50.520]   Nothing yours than the, the, the Mashable story or the Wall Street Journal story.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:55.080]   According to Bloomberg, they've talked to three people familiar with the matter.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.960]   Doesn't that mean they're in one of the two companies?
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.720]   It doesn't mean anything.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.520]   It's like you shouldn't do that.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.520]   According to...
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.760]   Tell us who they are or don't tell us anything.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.560]   According to three people who are familiar with the matter, Yahoo is working with Goldman
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:15.720]   Sachs to help defend against pop possible takeover attempts.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:19.640]   While the Sunnyvale company has not received an offer, Yahoo has been working with advisors
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:24.080]   for about two weeks to field any such approach.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:28.600]   And they've talked with private equity funds, including Silverlake about a possible bid.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.400]   I don't understand if they haven't talked to anybody about a takeover, but they're talking
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.400]   to Silverlake, isn't that...
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.960]   They're about a takeover.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   About a takeover.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.960]   So there's a contradiction in that sentence.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:44.480]   I do think that Tim Armstrong is the head of AOL as a smart guy and it's not inconceivable
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:50.280]   that he would do a better job than Yahoo is doing at figuring out a vision for Yahoo.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:54.400]   Because if Yahoo does have a clear idea of what Yahoo is, they're not doing a good job
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.760]   of explaining it to the rest of the world.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.040]   Since the Microsoft offer, Yahoo has lost half its value in the stock market.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.120]   Yeah, but that's largely due to the fact that the economy collapsed right after that deal.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.080]   Microsoft offered nearly $50 billion in 2008.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:17.480]   Now they're talking to private equity funds of weighed, raising $10 to $12 billion.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.440]   Maybe that's why AOL can afford them.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.680]   I mean, it's a fire sale.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:26.480]   Well, AOL is like a $2 billion company and Yahoo is a $20 billion company.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.840]   It should be the other way around.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.240]   You're always doing these deals.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.400]   I mean, it's not like the first time something like that's ever happened.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.720]   It should be a merger more than an acquisition, you think?
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.240]   Yeah, it'd be a merger.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.440]   Reverse merger?
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   Reverse merger.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.440]   Wow.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.480]   That's what AOL is thinking at least.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.360]   They don't want to sell themselves to Yahoo.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.640]   They don't want to figure out a way that even though they're much smaller, they end up controlling
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.320]   the combined company.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:55.120]   A big battle between cable vision and Fox brewing in parts of New Jersey, Long Island
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.040]   and Connecticut.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:04.040]   I have a feeling we're going to hear these, these, these wars are going to escalate further
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:11.760]   and further as they are pressured by companies like Google TV and Ola Cart sales in Apple.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:17.680]   Apparently Fox said to cable vision, we want to double the amount of money you pay us or
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.680]   more.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.280]   The amount of money you pay us per subscriber.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:25.080]   Cable vision said no freaking way.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.200]   They turned off Channel 5, the local Fox affiliate who happens to broadcast the Giants games.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.680]   Ow.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:37.360]   And then Fox pulled its stuff off Hulu for cable vision customers.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.720]   They said, well, in that case, you can't watch Hulu, Fox content on Hulu if you're
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.680]   a cable vision IP address.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.520]   Then they turned it back on.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.240]   They're still at the table.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.960]   Fox has a beef with the dish network too.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.880]   Yeah, there's the same thing going on with dish.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.240]   They want more money on a dish.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.160]   Yeah, and the dish guy, the CEO there, he is Charlie, Charlie Ergan.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.800]   You don't mess with Charlie.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.160]   Charlie's on the air moaning and groaning about this and calling these guys a bunch of sleaze
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   balls.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.160]   He has, he has it.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.000]   He's, he has, you don't mess with the guy who has his own TV show, Charlie talk.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.600]   I've been on Charlie talk.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.840]   Charlie Ergan is quite the, quite the character.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:19.520]   Let me tell you, I wonder if I could find Charlie talking about, this would be kind of
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.520]   fun.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.520]   Rupert, my God.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:26.400]   I would say when these things happen, the customers, their customers lose their.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.600]   Well, that's who gets screwed.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.480]   Yeah, they're not going to, yeah.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.440]   We become pawns as these guys battle it out.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.520]   And if you think the customer first, I think you'll end up doing right all every time.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.360]   Well, neither one is thinking about the customers.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.600]   They both are thinking about the bottom line, which I can't blame them.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.560]   And I think that as customers start moving away and start using companies like cable
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:51.240]   vision has excellent, really a good deal on bandwidth with optimum online.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.080]   And I think that, and I remember talking to cable vision executives, they seem like smart
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:59.240]   people at the time who said, you know, we don't want to sell people just bandwidth.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.600]   We want to sell them premium services.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.960]   We can't even survive selling bandwidth.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960]   But that's what's happening.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.760]   And that's what's, that's what all these companies, the pressure that's on these companies
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.320]   is customers are just saying, well, that's fine.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]   No problem.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.320]   I'll just watch a la carte.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.520]   Well, they got changed their business model.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.840]   The fact is that they can't make money selling bandwidth.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.080]   They've got the infrastructure.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.080]   It's sitting there.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.080]   It's paid for.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.560]   I mean, all you have to do is collect money, you know, just send bills out.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.040]   I mean, I don't see why they can't make money.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.200]   Maybe if they have to get rid of some people that, you know, they have nothing to do with
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.680]   anything, but they got to do more than what they're doing in terms of serving the public.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.680]   I just don't know.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.200]   I think it's, you can't blame cable vision.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.400]   You can't blame Fox or you can't, you can blame both.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.800]   There's no one bad guy in this.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800]   They're all bad actors.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.400]   And you're absolutely right, Dwight.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.160]   I mean, the people who get screwed here are the cable customers who can't watch their
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.720]   football game.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.920]   They did the last time they did this was what?
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.920]   The Academy Awards.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   Same thing happened.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.920]   Right.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.360]   And nobody can't do anything.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.520]   The other disturbing thing about this is that they were able to reach into Hulu and just
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.040]   say, no, you can't do that.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:12.600]   And if you think that the cable providers and the content providers are going to stand
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:17.760]   by and left things like internet services like Hulu, you know, kill off their cash
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.720]   cash cash, that's kind of an example.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.720]   That was just a little one.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.000]   That was a that was a small nuclear weapon.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.160]   Is it a net neutrality issue?
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.160]   Yes.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.760]   Yes, that's exactly what that was.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.160]   I think the FCC be very interested in that.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.160]   Well, okay.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.720]   You can't, if you're going to do that to us, we're going to, we're going to pull our
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.960]   content off your internet access.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960]   Right.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.760]   Is that at Fox executive?
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.240]   If you're doing their deal, you nailed it.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:51.840]   Well, it was it was interesting how fast they turned it back around and it almost sounded
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.000]   like, no, yeah, this is not a bad.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   This is not a good idea.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.760]   Well, so, you know, like a like a lower level senior VP dot four said, I'll, you know, let's
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.760]   do this.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.160]   And then Rupert woke up and said, what no, and, you know, undid it.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.840]   And I think that's probably what happened.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.120]   It was a bad idea.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:19.120]   This the the notice that you would get this fortune dot com, calling the Seth Wine Trob
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.840]   did a screen cap of this notice.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.040]   He tried to watch a Fox show on Hulu.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:28.560]   We noticed that you were attempting to access Fox content on Hulu.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   Unfortunately, this content is currently unavailable to cable vision customers.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:36.200]   We look forward to bringing Fox content to cable vision customers again soon.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.080]   And of course they don't explain why they're doing this.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.120]   No, all you know is that they're denying you something.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.280]   Yeah, not because you did anything wrong.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.720]   Yeah, you just happen to choose to live in the wrong city.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.920]   What jerks?
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:57.000]   Uh, Hulu PR rep, lysish, Elisa Schreiber statement.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.040]   Unfortunately, we were put in a position of needing to block Fox content on Hulu in order
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.440]   to remain neutral.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.440]   Turn contract negotiation.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.800]   There's somebody that can throw it around.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:12.920]   So Hulu, what happened was Hulu, I bet you they got a call.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.160]   You're going to take the blame for this.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.600]   So Hulu said, Oh no, we did it because we wanted to stay neutral.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.560]   Is Fox one of the partners in Hulu?
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.520]   Partner yes, but Hulu is a separate company.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   It's very confused.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   Right.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   So they're involved in it.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:33.400]   Yeah, but who I bet you Hulu got a call from Fox saying, look, if if you, you know,
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.800]   you better say you did this in order to stay neutral.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.960]   New does the word neutral.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:44.440]   Well, we're just preserving neutrality because otherwise we're screwed.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.440]   Wow.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:50.200]   I have to, I really feel for people who live in the, uh, in the cable visionary, but I
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.800]   just think in the long run, all this does is hasten the demise of cable television for
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.640]   every, it seems really a soft destructor.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.640]   But that's what happens.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.640]   Isn't it?
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.720]   When you get, look at the record industry, look at the movie industries.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.040]   Look, that's what happens when you get up against it and your business, your old business
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.800]   model is starting to fail.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.840]   You're cornered and you lash out and you don't bother to change the business model.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.840]   You don't think about it.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:17.400]   You just say, no, I'm not going.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.800]   Apple's app store crosses 300,000 apps.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.680]   Well, did you say there's some controversy whether that's true or not?
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.480]   There were a couple of stories that said that and then, um, fill up the owner duet also
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.920]   at fortune said that that's wrong.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.760]   There's a lot of inactive apps.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   They shouldn't count that.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.800]   It says that's counting apps that no longer on the market.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.440]   And it's so more like 280,000.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.000]   So 148 apps notes.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.760]   There are 334,199 approved apps of which 55,000 are inactive.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.720]   So really there's only 278,000 active apps.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   Who cares?
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:54.720]   They're close.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.720]   They're not.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.720]   They're close.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.720]   They never.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.760]   Apple has 2000 apps and Android has about what?
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.880]   80,000, 90,000 apps.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.880]   Windows mobile.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.880]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.040]   That's odd man out.
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:12.640]   Google said there are 90,000 apps, but Android lib.com says 113,000 Android apps in the marketplace.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.480]   You know, any more than like 50 or 60.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.040]   I mean, how about the app?
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.040]   60.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.520]   How about the more than 50 or 60 apps?
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.360]   Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.920]   I mean, I have a hundred and I counted 105 apps on my iPhone.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.960]   And how many do you use on a routine basis, Leo?
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.160]   Well, not all of them, for sure.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.000]   Probably half a dozen.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.280]   Most of the, you know, I have to review apps.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.080]   So that's why I've got so many on here.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.560]   Periodically, I'll prune through them.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.560]   Get rid of them.
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.680]   Back in the early days of the web, would people were relying on bookmarks.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.760]   There were stories where studies had been done that found that people would bookmark
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.760]   dozens of apps.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:50.240]   I mean, dozens of websites, but then only use six or seven.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.240]   That was kind of the number.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.240]   Right.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.760]   And now you're seeing the same thing with apps.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.360]   People tend to use about six or seven of them.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.640]   What's about what I use on my iPhone?
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.440]   You know, I have to admit now, John and I have a very famous bet, which I won that I said
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.120]   that it's Apple had sell more than five million iPads, which seemed like a lot.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.360]   At the time, I was a little nervous.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.720]   In fact, it's going to be more than twice that in the first year.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:12.800]   And I won that bet.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:18.680]   But now I have to say all I ever do on my iPad is play Angry Birds and We Rule.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.280]   So I don't really know how useful it is.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:29.080]   I took last weekend, I went to see my daughter at the University of Missouri and saw an excellent
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.520]   football game against Colorado.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:39.400]   But during the zoo football weekends, the town fills up with parents and with alumni.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.920]   We were staying at a windgate hotel kind of out on the outskirts of town.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.400]   And it was full of parents.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:49.880]   And in the breakfast area in the morning where they have the free breakfast, there were four
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.240]   people on point I counted with iPads.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.160]   Yeah, they're as these parents.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:59.440]   I was astounded at kind of this is middle American parents and they were kind of looking
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:05.520]   up sports scores and checking the news and people were crowded around looking at them.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:10.720]   And I saw them in restaurants going up to on the way up there from Houston and all the
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.720]   way back.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.720]   I was just kind of amazed, you know, getting out of kind of the metropolitan area where
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.360]   I am and going into middle America and seeing iPads everywhere.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.400]   Apple really has got a hit on its hands.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.960]   Yeah, I'll go to the airport.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960]   Everybody.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.320]   It's almost weird if you don't have an iPad or an iPhone.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.880]   And yet I bring a laptop and people point and laugh.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.880]   What is wrong?
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.880]   He must be an old curmudgeon.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.680]   But I'm actually saying.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.400]   Actually typing here, kids go away.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.520]   What I'm saying though is that your fundamental insight might have been right, John, because
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.560]   it isn't all that it's an amusement.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.560]   A pricey one at that.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.320]   A pricey amusement.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.040]   Do you disagree, Dwight, or Harry?
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.000]   My first reaction to the iPad was that I didn't need to have it.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.960]   I remember you were underwhelmed when you saw it.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:08.480]   But I use it more and more and I wouldn't call it an amusement.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:13.800]   It's increasingly it's becoming the primary way I read if I want to actually read something
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.000]   on the web or watch video.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.960]   I've become addicted to the TED Talks app, which lets you watch the TED videos that have
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.960]   been available on the web forever.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:31.960]   But I'd much rather sit in an easy chair with my iPad and watch these videos that way.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.960]   And I learned something.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:40.280]   I've also addicted to Flipboard, the app that lets you look at links on Twitter as a magazine.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.520]   And so I find myself using it as a reader and a media consumption device.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.120]   I don't like trying to do email on it.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.440]   I don't like necessarily just randomly surfing the web.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.640]   But I do enjoy consuming media on it.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.320]   And I would be sad if someone took it away from me.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.360]   Maybe what I'm really saying is that increasingly I feel like maybe this is maybe I'm getting
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.640]   burned out.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:09.680]   I increasingly feel like technology is more about distraction than actually productivity
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.840]   or creation or innovation.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.840]   It's all just a bunch of shiny crap.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.280]   I actually like the iPad a lot.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.640]   Okay, Harry, you're the technologist.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.640]   You defend this.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.320]   I mean, I actually like the iPad for reading long things.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:29.960]   So I feel like I don't get that distracted with that as opposed to my computer where
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.800]   I'm leaping between I am an email.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.880]   And I have 14 tabs up and in my browser.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.200]   To me, the iPad is fantastic as a replacement for Sunday newspapers.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.520]   I use it a lot more on the weekend than I do during the work week.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.720]   I'm not sure why, but I like doing email on it.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.440]   I think maybe just because it's kind of simpler and it's not overwhelming like Gmail or Outlook.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.920]   That's the one productivity thing I do more on my iPad than any other single thing.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.920]   All right.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.560]   I don't have one.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.960]   But you have plenty of other shiny crap.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.200]   If I had one, I'd probably be looking at porn.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.080]   It's very good for, wait a minute, never mind.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.080]   What was that, Leo?
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.880]   We're going to be right back in just a moment.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.880]   I don't know.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.280]   Wait for 3D porn anyway.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.760]   John Scully, finally, for the first time since his ouster at Apple Computer talks about
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.240]   Steve Jobs.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:30.160]   We have that story and a lot more coming up in just a little bit.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.920]   But with our great guests, and I'm really glad we, this has been a fun show.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.920]   Harry McCracken from the Technologizer is here.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.160]   We've got Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle on blogs.cron.com and the tech blog
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   there.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.720]   And of course, John C. Dvorak.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:53.160]   Hey, host of No Agenda where he makes thousands of dollars an episode because, you know, after
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:59.200]   we talked last week and I was like stunned, the people would send you $233.33 to be listed
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.600]   as a producer in the credits.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.600]   I was just 3/3.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.840]   I was just stunned.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:05.080]   Like a bunch of people did that.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.080]   It was so stunned.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.560]   And it was funny because I think people feel guilty because I noticed that week I got a
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.200]   lot of big contributions.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.200]   You did?
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.280]   You're making millions of dollars and they're sending you free money and you're complaining
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.280]   about us and our podcast.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.720]   I'm not complaining anymore.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.720]   I'm stopped.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:25.680]   I just thought I think a lot of people, because, you know, we ask for donations and what we
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.040]   do with the donations is that's my salary instead of, you know, taking a salary out of
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.040]   to it.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.200]   And I believe I make plenty of money.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.200]   I don't need to.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200]   It's not.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.200]   It's not to give me extra money because you give John money.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.000]   But I just, I thought it was very interesting.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.200]   I think there were at least about two or three dozen people who thought, oops.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:46.760]   I had to give, nobody gave me $333.33.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.000]   I will say that.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.040]   I was at Blog World yesterday in Las Vegas.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.040]   That was a lot of fun.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.800]   And one of the, one of the boos there was Ford.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.480]   Ford was giving, it was kind of fun.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.080]   They were giving test drives.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:04.160]   I drove the 2011 Mustang 5.0 and now I want to trade in my 2010.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.760]   I love it so much.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.160]   And I drove the new Ford Edge.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.320]   And boy, was I impressed with that.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.320]   Ford is really on a roll.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.240]   We want to thank them for their support of all of our Twitch shows.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.240]   I was really glad to drive this new 2011 Edge.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.280]   It starts with a great design and the exterior.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:22.280]   And you'll see this with, I saw the focus, the next year's focus.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.280]   That is beautiful too.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.680]   They're really the design.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.600]   They're doing now very fluid and aerodynamic.
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.360]   The focus is going to be an international car.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.240]   The same car all around the world.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.400]   They've never done that really before.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.280]   And I think they've just got designed down.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:39.480]   And of course inside, the Edge looks a lot like my Mustang
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:44.080]   with this very clean, classic look.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.920]   The instrument panel now, they use this My Ford Touch in there.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.960]   And so you've got three screens with the My Ford Touch.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.840]   You've got a big, I think it's seven or eight inch GPS screen.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.680]   But you've got two small screens where you, and one of them
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:57.560]   is a tachometer.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:00.880]   And one of them is like control center for your music and climate.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.200]   It's so cool.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.480]   Just beautiful fit and finish.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.120]   They're really solid cars.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.840]   It is best in class with the legroom in the second row.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.640]   I went back and sat in the back seat.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.840]   Ah, love it.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.440]   You can get the panoramic vista roof.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.360]   That's an option with the forward panel that tilts or opens fully,
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.320]   plus a fixed rear skylight.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:25.840]   So you get great air and light in the front and the back seat.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.040]   They did the same thing in the Edge that they did with my Mustang
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.080]   with the ambient lighting.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.400]   So you have seven color programmable ambient lighting.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.240]   It's standard and limited and sport and available on the SEL.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.560]   You program it.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:39.520]   And so some days I'm in a purple mood.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.280]   So the ambient lighting is purple.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.520]   Some days I'm in an orange mood.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.480]   But you're not giving up on fuel efficiency.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.920]   It's got the 3.5 liter TI-VCTV6 engine.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.840]   This is the new engine that they just.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.640]   They've done such a good job of it.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:58.960]   285 horsepower with unsurpassed fuel economy for its class.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.720]   The Edge has an estimated 27 highway miles per gallon.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.760]   They've also got the Edge Sport for performance.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:09.360]   That's got 305 horsepower, 280 foot-pounds of torque,
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.200]   Sport tune suspension, 22-inch polished aluminum wheels
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.640]   is the one I drove, performance tires and more.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.480]   It was so much fun.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.080]   We were going down Las Vegas Boulevard,
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.520]   and Lisa was driving the 2011 Mustang 5.0.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.520]   I was driving the Edge, and we drag raced.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:26.760]   And it was so much fun until we got stopped.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.640]   The Biford Touch, which is brand new,
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.080]   they announced that at CES in January--
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:30.760]   I'm just kidding.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.360]   We didn't drag race.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.560]   What else in here?
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.440]   You know about the sync.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.120]   The touch is basically Sync Plus.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.840]   So you can keep your hands on the wheel,
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.600]   your eyes on the road, but you get to choose your music.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.680]   It also has now these five-way switch pads
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.200]   on the steering wheel, two of them.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.400]   Oh, it's an eight-inch screen I see here.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.360]   Really gorgeous.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.080]   You could switch between the touch commands
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.480]   and the voice commands on the fly.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:57.840]   Also, by the way, the Biford Touch is expandable,
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.360]   which means you could do things like Pandora, Stitcher,
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.520]   Slacker Radio.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.240]   Really incredible.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.880]   Two USB inputs, an SD card slot.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:12.960]   RCAAV input jacks.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.240]   You can get an available mobile in-car Wi-Fi hotspot
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.280]   through a USB installed air card or the USB mobile broadband
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.400]   modem.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.440]   I mean, I can just go on and on.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.240]   This is really bad.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.760]   You know what you should do is you should go to your Ford
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.320]   Lincoln and Mercury dealer and test drive
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.760]   a Ford today and look at the sync.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:31.600]   Look at the Mi-4 Touch.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.760]   And if you're interested in a sport utility vehicle,
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.160]   take a look at the Ford Edge.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.720]   This is the highest tech Ford out there
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.880]   and well worth a test drive.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.160]   The 2011 Ford Edge looks good, drives great, great efficiency.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.640]   Thank you, Ford, for supporting that this week in tech
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.880]   and for that great car.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.080]   I had a blast driving.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.280]   My wife now wants one.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.560]   We were thinking the flex.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.560]   Now she's driving the edge.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.360]   She really likes it.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.400]   Leo, I envy you.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.560]   You're Mustang.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.600]   I love my Mustang.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.400]   But now I want the 2001--
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.040]   Oh, you do?
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:05.600]   Love it.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.800]   Yeah, that's classic.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.640]   Probably won't get another one until I get my kids out
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.080]   of college.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:10.560]   Right.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.440]   I got that feeling.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.000]   I would probably get a new one.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:13.960]   I love it.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.280]   Then can I just make one suggestion?
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:20.960]   Do I do not go to a four-dealer and test drive the 2011 5.0?
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.680]   Oh, yeah?
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.080]   Do not.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:23.640]   I mean, I have a--
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.000]   I have a kids to go to community college.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.440]   Yeah, I have a 2010.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.960]   And I want-- it's like, oh my gosh.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:29.960]   What's so better about it?
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.800]   Come on.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.960]   They got a new engine in it.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.160]   Well, first of all, it's 5.0.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.560]   They got a new engine.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.000]   It runs--
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.680]   What's your capacity in yours?
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.160]   It's a VA, but I don't know.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.160]   That would be a 5.0.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.000]   They've been putting 5.0 on these things for a while.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.600]   But now this is a completely redesigned engine.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.720]   And it's smooth as silk.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:51.560]   But man, the torque in this thing, mine's 4.6.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.920]   Everybody in the chat room says 4.6.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.360]   They know what--
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.240]   All right, 4.6.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.080]   They know what kind of engine I have.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:56.640]   The new 5.0--
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.080]   And you don't.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:57.600]   That's good.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:57.800]   I know.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.320]   Go on.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:58.760]   I know.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.400]   I know when I push the accelerator, it goes, boom.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.600]   Boom.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:04.600]   Boom.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.760]   I love it.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.240]   What about the styling?
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.440]   How's the styling changed?
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.440]   I hope I can say this.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.840]   I hope Ford won't treat this in this.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.320]   Sure you can.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.440]   But they went through a bad period where basically a Mustang
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.160]   looked like--
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.360]   I don't know-- Toyota Corolla.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.560]   I mean, I just do not like the design.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.720]   But that was back a few years.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.720]   And they were also having trouble, I know,
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.840]   because of the marketing studies that were done,
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.080]   that the cars were starting to appeal to women.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.640]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.920]   Well, for a Mustang it is.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.200]   Well, this appeals to me.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:37.080]   The new-- my Mustang and the new one looks very much the same.
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.880]   I think the only difference I could tell
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.920]   is instead of a matte finish on the Ford touch,
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.200]   they had a glossy finish on the Ford touch.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.160]   But otherwise it was the same.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.680]   But it's a classic look.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.760]   They've really gone back to the classic muscle car.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.760]   Very clean, all analog gauges.
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.680]   I just love it.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.160]   Mask on.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.600]   Will you drove my car?
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.440]   Yeah, it's a nice car.
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.160]   It's very masking.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.440]   I can't see women really liking it that much.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.640]   Oh, I know of you.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.400]   Not like the old-- the Mustangs that were very feminine.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:04.640]   No, this is--
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.440]   My wife and I just had a discussion about this.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.320]   The car, she says that there are certain cars.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.000]   You just-- they feel like a man's car when you're in them.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.280]   And you may or may not like them.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.840]   My Lexus is a good example.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.880]   She finds it very uncomfortable to drive.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:16.840]   And I find it very comfortable.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.120]   Well, my wife feels the same way.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:18.480]   You know what?
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.040]   You're right.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:20.480]   You're right.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:25.920]   But it's like a smoking jacket pipe kind of a thing.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.880]   Yeah, women don't care if they go for that look.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880]   Right.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.360]   But the--
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:29.720]   In a fan.
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.800]   She says it's just-- she says the dimensions
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.640]   and the way it feels.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.520]   She just doesn't feel--
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:34.920]   I think you're right.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.240]   No, Jennifer doesn't like it either.
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.200]   But I love it.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:38.880]   God, I love it.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.720]   Yeah, it's a manly car.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.720]   But I like it too.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.600]   I don't know.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.360]   Because Lisa wants-- and I know a number of women
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.520]   who have gotten in my--
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.920]   you know who really loved it?
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.280]   Denise Howell of This Week in Law.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.360]   She took it for a ride.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.600]   And she didn't come back for like an hour.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:00.280]   And then she pretended she'd lost her car keys and said,
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.600]   can I have it?
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.520]   And I said, no.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:03.960]   She was going to--
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.000]   My daughter covets mine.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.240]   Yeah, I think it just depends.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:11.080]   There are women who love muscle cars.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.080]   And I like the women who love--
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.840]   But they usually talk like this.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.360]   No, they don't.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.160]   Oh, you are so--
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:15.840]   No, no.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.360]   My daughter does not talk like that.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.280]   You know, Denise is gorgeous.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:22.360]   You know who else-- one of our--
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:23.160]   we have this debate.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.920]   One of our chatters is a professor of geology
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.920]   at Ohio State University.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.280]   She gave me this mug.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.440]   And Darth Emma-- and she drives a 2010 Camaro.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.520]   So one of these days, we're going to have a little--
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.400]   You can race her.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.720]   We're going to have a little space.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.880]   She loves her Camaro.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:44.600]   Make sure to give her a Wisconsin Badger mug.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.320]   I have a Badger bristle brush for my shaving.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.200]   Is that the same thing?
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.200]   Sure.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.360]   I get that joke.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.280]   Apparently nobody else--
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.280]   Nobody else does.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.280]   It's very bad.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:00.800]   iPad coming to Verizon October 28.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.840]   But don't get your hopes up.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.560]   It's kind of a bad deal.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:10.480]   It is a Wi-Fi iPad bundled for $120 extra dollars
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.920]   with a Wi-Fi that is locked down to it.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:19.960]   And a bandwidth deal that is not spectacular.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.480]   But it is a deal with Verizon.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.480]   Do you think it's a harbinger of things
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.160]   to come here in McCracken?
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:25.880]   Well, yeah.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.200]   I mean, it definitely sounds like I can't--
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.600]   what might be happening soon.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.760]   I actually have an iPad and a Verizon Wi-Fi, which I love
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.880]   together, but I love them because I can use the Wi-Fi
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.200]   with all my other devices too.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.280]   And I did not realize until you just
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:46.720]   mentioned that the one you get with the iPad is locked to it.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.600]   That's kind of silly compared to the AT&T one.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.400]   You could probably spoof the MAC address I
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.800]   bet with other devices and be your connect to it.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.120]   Because Clear does the same thing.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.160]   The Clear has an eye.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.520]   I have to clear it.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.120]   CNET-- I'm sorry, LA Times is reporting
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.520]   that Steve Jobs invited Mark Zuckerberg to dinner at his house
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.160]   and a stroll.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.160]   Dinner and a stroll.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.040]   This is what the Times said.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:14.960]   Who was stroll?
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.960]   Stroll.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.920]   Is he hitting on him?
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.240]   What's the deal?
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.840]   If it was a stroll, it certainly wasn't
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.160]   through the public streets.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.560]   Must have been in the backyard.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.120]   Apparently, the discussion, according to the Times,
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.440]   was over Ping Apple's social music service, which
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.960]   is blocked currently by Facebook.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.800]   Apple reportedly spoke to Facebook for 18 months,
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.280]   trying to work out a deal with Ping,
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.880]   launched it with Ping-- with Facebook Connect.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.320]   And Facebook pulled the switch and said, no.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.880]   Apple-- Steve Jobs said to Cara Swisher
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:53.440]   that the terms were so onerous we couldn't agree to them.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.800]   So according to the Times--
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.680]   And he should know.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.120]   Onerous terms.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.280]   You're the king of it, aren't you, Steve?
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.320]   According to the Times, Jobs is trying to charm Zuckerberg
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.840]   with a little home cooking.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:08.160]   Now tell him to make sure to wear underwear.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.720]   Oh, please.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:10.800]   What?
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.080]   I don't even know what that means.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.680]   It's a reference to an article in Vanity Fair some time
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.080]   back and to the movie they made.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:24.360]   Nobody keeps up?
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.880]   Do Steve-- who doesn't wear underwear and why?
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.400]   I don't-- the movie that was made about--
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.400]   I don't want to know.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.680]   I'm almost-- you don't even want to know.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.840]   You're saying Steve Jobs under those black jeans
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.000]   is not wearing--
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:37.520]   No, no, no.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.560]   He was wearing a pair-- he's reported in the Vanity Fair,
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.760]   really irked Jobs.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.120]   The guy reported that apparently when somebody came in for an
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.400]   interview, Jobs had some of those shorts on or something,
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.600]   no underwear.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.400]   Put his legs up on the table.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.400]   Oh, no.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   It was showing--
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.400]   No.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.400]   This story is old.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.400]   Oh, no.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.640]   Oh, no.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.800]   Are you saying he was flying the flag of freedom?
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.760]   Yeah, that's exactly how Steve shorts.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.080]   He was letting his freak flag fly.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.680]   So you bookmarked this story, Dwight Silverman.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:18.600]   John Scully, for the first time ever, talks about Steve Jobs.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.160]   Where is this from?
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.560]   It's from called of Mac, Landar County.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.720]   Got that interview.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.640]   The most interesting thing about it, he goes into detail
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.560]   about what he thinks Steve's principles are for success.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.160]   But the most interesting line in the whole thing, he says,
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:40.600]   is that they haven't talked and that Steve is still pissed,
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.360]   still angry, and he doesn't want to piss Steve off.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.160]   Oh, interesting.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.520]   But there was a mistake.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:45.960]   That's interesting.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:46.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.640]   What does Scully do in these?
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.320]   He's an investor, right?
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.840]   Yeah, he's just an investor.
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:55.880]   But is he still nervous about getting on Steve's bad side?
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.880]   That's ridiculous.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.120]   What a wimp.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.280]   Can I say something about that laundry list?
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.120]   That was-- we put a list of things
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.520]   he thought were interesting about Steve Jobs and why
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.880]   is successful.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:09.280]   I didn't think the list was that interesting overall.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.960]   But there was one thing on there that I think that was good.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.600]   It should be noted.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.680]   Which is that Steve Jobs doesn't believe in focus groups.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:17.160]   Yep.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.000]   No focus groups.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.280]   Steve said, how can I possibly ask someone
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.400]   what a graphics-based computer ought to be when they have no idea
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.440]   what a graphic-based computer is?
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.160]   No one's ever seen one before.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.400]   Scully said Jobs believed that showing somebody a calculator,
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.400]   for example, would not give them any indication
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.680]   as to where the computer was going to go because it was just
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.640]   too big a leap.
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.720]   He appraised Jobs for beautiful design.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.680]   He praised Jobs for always looking at things
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.040]   from the perspective of what was the user experience going to be.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:51.320]   He also looked at the supply chain, the marketing, the stores.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.160]   He's still doing it.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.800]   That's Scully's main point.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:55.080]   He's a micro-manager.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:59.080]   But Scully's main point was that the principles that he knew
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:03.240]   from way back when Jobs were first principles
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.440]   were still there, still remain.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.280]   Well, the one that's interesting to me still--
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.560]   because I know that big corporations in this country--
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.080]   Oh, they were.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:10.600]   --in particular--
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.360]   --are cowed by focus groups.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.480]   And Steve is absolutely right in anybody who's sensible.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:20.240]   You can't focus group new ideas to such an extreme
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.440]   that you're going to get any good information from these people
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.600]   because they don't have anything-- there's no frame of reference.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.800]   Right.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.520]   That's a good point.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.960]   I don't do focus groups either, John.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.440]   Really?
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.920]   I think this is the Otura theory of creation.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.800]   You get the best creative result if you let somebody
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.320]   with a great vision create his vision.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:45.320]   And promote their vision.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.040]   And promote their vision.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.120]   It's interesting, though, that such a team effort
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.760]   as a technology, like when you're making an iPod,
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.960]   you've got designers, you've got the supply chain,
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.800]   you've got the suppliers of the parts,
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:02.160]   you've got so many pieces in this machine
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.200]   that you normally don't think of it as an Otura,
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.920]   there's some one person controlling it.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.240]   Very few people have the dominant personality
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.040]   that Steve Jobs has that's required
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:16.400]   to do this from soup to nuts.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.480]   I can't think of anybody else like this.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.440]   It's almost like a picture director.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.440]   Really?
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:21.640]   It is.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:22.680]   It's like a Spielberg.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:28.000]   But the thing is, not a lot of people have that vision.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.480]   A lot of people can sell themselves as having that vision.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.080]   But when it comes time to execute it,
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.080]   they don't always do it.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:34.800]   I don't know.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.240]   Oh, no, maybe I shouldn't do it that way.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:38.680]   What do you think?
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.880]   As soon as you say that, you're not Steve Jobs.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:45.480]   Steve, three words you never hear from Steve Jobs, four words.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.640]   What do you think?
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:49.160]   You never going to hear that.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:53.000]   And everyone that goes and Leo is booked, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   Four words you'll never hear from Steve Jobs.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.040]   Actually, that's where the Otura theory comes from, isn't it?
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.200]   It's from filmmaking.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.360]   From the great my filmmakers.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.680]   I can't think, though, of a business of a lot of people
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.400]   who are considered Oturs.
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.680]   Maybe the guy who did the DeLorean.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.160]   Software sometimes, hardware almost never.
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.920]   It's just too hard.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:22.320]   Other words used to describe Jobs by Steve and by Scottie, John
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:25.200]   Scully, perfectionism.
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.640]   Obviously.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:28.320]   Vision.
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.720]   He believed the computer was eventually
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.120]   going to become a consumer product that
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.720]   was an outrageous idea in the early '80s.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:38.480]   But Steve was thinking about something entirely different.
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.480]   He thought the computer was going to change the world,
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:43.440]   and it was going to become what he called the bicycle for the mind.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.360]   He was a person of huge vision.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.000]   Minimalism.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.400]   By the way, we should mention that Steve Jobs was also
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:55.760]   one of the hot shots that perceived the segue as a world
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.560]   changer.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:58.240]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:58.880]   He did, didn't he?
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:04.000]   He said cities will be redesigned because of the segue.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.840]   Whoops.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:06.840]   Whoops.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:09.920]   Well, you can-- look, I don't think anybody's ever said
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.240]   Steve hasn't made some mistakes.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.800]   I think the-- let's see, the cube.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.320]   Next was a mistake, really.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.840]   I mean, he really insisted that people--
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.080]   well, how many next cubes were sold?
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:21.840]   That was like--
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:22.320]   There was like--
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.800]   --and the loads of thousands or something.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.120]   Yeah, it was a very--
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.120]   it was a product that never took off.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.080]   By the way, I never thought the operating system on the Mac
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.280]   today is next.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:31.920]   Well, that's true.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:32.440]   Sorry, John.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.440]   It's next step.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.880]   No, that's fine.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.840]   But I'm thinking that the cube, I thought,
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.480]   was a beautiful piece of equipment.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.040]   It just had some flaws, manufacturing issues.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.720]   The Apple, the G5 cube, which looked a lot like the next cube.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.000]   The next cube that you're seeing in the top,
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.520]   and you look like a toaster.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.560]   Higher the best, that's true.
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.720]   Sweat the details.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.560]   On one level, he's working to change the world,
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:55.240]   the big concept.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:56.720]   At the other level, he's working down
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.400]   at the details of what it takes to actually build a product
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.040]   and design the software, the hardware, the systems design,
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.680]   eventually the applications, the peripherals.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:05.200]   He was also--
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:05.960]   That's great.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:06.400]   Sorry.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.920]   He was also adamantly involved in the advertising design
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:09.360]   and everything.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:10.360]   Go ahead, Gary.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.040]   I was just to say, one of the great unanswerable questions
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.880]   of computer history is, what would have happened if Jobs had
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:16.560]   never left?
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.880]   Would he have not learned from the next experience?
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.360]   Right.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.960]   And therefore had problems with which he didn't when he came back,
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.320]   maybe a little bit humbler, or would he have accomplished
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.360]   even more even quicker?
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:29.800]   So you didn't have this long period where Apple was nowhere
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.400]   near as being as much of a force in the industry
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.960]   as it was during Jobs regime 1 and Jobs regime 2.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:36.960]   I have to say, I think--
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:37.240]   Next was--
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:41.080]   It could have happened in another dimension.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.000]   We need Philip K. Dick to write that story.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.680]   I have to say, I think Next was actually
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:48.040]   really important for Jobs.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.600]   It slapped him around a little bit, didn't it?
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:54.760]   It's also where he got the new vision for the Mac.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.160]   You know, I mean, he met Ovi.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.320]   If he had not gone off, he would not necessarily have--
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:02.800]   we wouldn't have kind of OS 10 the way we do today.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.880]   And I think it also was the beginning of the end
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:09.120]   for the souring relationship with Adobe.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:09.600]   Oh, God.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:15.160]   That's just-- Steve still hates Adobe.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.840]   Credit, by the way-- you mentioned it, Harry,
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.240]   but I want to make sure we give full credit to Leander Kehaney,
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:24.880]   who got this interview with John Scully at an airport.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.760]   Leander told me about it.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:26.960]   I think he did a little bit while ago.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.200]   And my eyes opened kind of wide when he said he got that,
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:32.120]   because John Scully is this figure, which, no matter
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:37.160]   what you think of, he was at one of the truly monumental
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.360]   points in Tech History.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:41.080]   And he saw stuff that he has not written about much other
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:45.120]   than his book, which he did 25 years ago, I think.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.160]   Right.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.840]   So Kudos to Leander.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.120]   And it's in the cult of Mac website, cultofmac.com.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.040]   Is he doing that himself?
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.800]   No, he's not at Wired anymore.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.920]   He left Wired.
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:56.840]   He kind of did what I did.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.640]   He was working on his own site full-time.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.040]   And he has some freelance contributors.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.560]   And he's going to do his own thing his own way.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.800]   We got to get Leander on our Mac break weekly.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.000]   I like Leander, yeah.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.520]   So I have to throw something in his somebody in the chat room
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.400]   suggested.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.000]   What's that?
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.040]   Now we got to target a Spindler interview.
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.600]   Yeah, Spindler and Emilio.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.840]   Emilio apparently has talked and he just
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.720]   says he doesn't have anything good to say.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.280]   But Spindler would be very interesting.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.040]   Whatever that was.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.280]   He was used to hiding with the--
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:30.280]   Spindler is supposed to be necessary.
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.560]   Interesting, I think.
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.360]   He's just a Emilio's book as a fascinating read.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.880]   Startly after Emilio left, he wrote a book.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.360]   And when you read the book, you say,
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.640]   this guy just didn't get it, which I don't think
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.880]   was his intention.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:45.680]   But it is a learning experience to read a book,
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.480]   but it was, I think, honest but strange.
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:49.360]   To this day, Emilio believes--
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.160]   I'm pretty sure it believes-- that everything
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:54.480]   that Steve Jobs accomplished when he ousted Emilio
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:57.360]   and took back over was stuff that Gill had started.
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.240]   Yes.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.240]   Emilio kind of says the IAMAC was basically
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:00.760]   his idea.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.840]   That was my idea.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.520]   Well, you know, this is a guy that
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.280]   comes from the semiconductor industry.
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:09.960]   And in that business, that's the way they all are.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.880]   I thought of the iPod.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.600]   Oh, I knew all about that.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:16.280]   She iPhone, that was my idea.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:17.880]   I had that Jobs guy.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.920]   He just followed up.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:24.960]   He's a-- you know, he's basically a talented clerk.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.680]   His instrument is a semiconductor industry voice.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:32.400]   Yeah, they all talk like that in a semiconductor industry.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.840]   He's just a talented clerk.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.600]   He's got-- you know, he's got some good ideas.
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.320]   I'm not saying that.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.440]   But really, I thought of it.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:43.280]   They all talk just like Ralph Delavicco.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.280]   It's Barney Frank.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.800]   Barney Frank is what sounds like to me.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:46.480]   Barney Frank.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:52.120]   Barney Frank has a cartoon voice, doesn't he?
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.760]   He really does.
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.320]   Deleted Facebook photos, not deleted.
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.200]   Credit to ours, Technica for discovering this.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.120]   Facebook's post-bursement, Simon Axton,
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:09.200]   checked back in with ours, saying, well, yeah, well,
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.480]   that's a CDN problem.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:12.680]   They're caching those photos.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.400]   But we're going to delete them soon.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.280]   So don't worry.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:19.960]   It's OK.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:24.280]   The ad-noital middle manager, the software company.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:27.720]   Facebook talks.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.800]   Privacy watchdog uncovered a government memo
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:32.520]   that encourages federal agents to befriend people
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:35.200]   on a variety of social networks to take advantage
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.160]   of their readiness to share and to spy on them and the result.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.200]   This is a freedom of information request.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:44.200]   The government released a handful of documents,
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.760]   including a May 2008 memo detailing
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:50.400]   how social networking sites are exploited by the FDNS.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.200]   I never heard of this.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.520]   It's the office of fraud, detection, and national security.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:57.200]   I don't even know who that is.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.200]   Agents are encouraged to take the opportunity to reveal fraud
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.320]   by poking around in people's profiles
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:05.200]   and see whether they're in valid relationships
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.480]   or attempting some other kind of fraud
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.840]   to get into the country.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.640]   Once a user posts online--
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.480]   Go ahead.
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:15.200]   This falls into the category of, of course they are.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.200]   I think that would be--
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:16.600]   I guess so, huh.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:17.720]   Yes, of course.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.000]   If you're putting this information out in a public profile
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.200]   and law enforcement's going to be interested in it,
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.880]   then, of course, they're going to do that.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.800]   I'd be surprised if they weren't.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.520]   I like the headline on the law and disorder section
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:32.280]   of Ours Technica.
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.840]   Government relies on Facebook narcissism
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:37.560]   to spot fake marriages and fraud, Jackie Chang.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.960]   And the photo's great, too.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.040]   It's Lieutenant Dreyben, and it looks like he's reading
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.200]   the Facebook newspaper.
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.440]   Dreyben.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.160]   Why, yes.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.480]   Nice beaver.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:54.400]   Marissa Meyer has a promotion.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:56.080]   I thought it was a demotion.
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:59.000]   She-- uh, uh, uh, uh, I hear you
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.480]   silonning, Mr. Adwet.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:00.680]   So--
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.680]   Dose.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.680]   Wagonon, plug.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.480]   Wagonon, plug.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.680]   Wagonon, plug.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.320]   Wagonon-- look at that.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:06.840]   He's running.
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.240]   He's scrambling.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:08.760]   Come on.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:09.400]   Is that cord?
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.720]   I think he left.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:11.600]   I'm sorry, Dwight.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.480]   I didn't mean to-- oh, look.
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.920]   Giant-- no.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.160]   Giant fingers.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.520]   OK, it's time to end this show.
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:21.960]   Boy, we were talking about some of her people.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:22.960]   Marissa Meyer.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.440]   Marissa Meyer, um, she is-- she was head of search.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.720]   You'd think head of search at Google
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.120]   be like as high as you can go.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.480]   But they've taken her out of search
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:34.120]   and put her in local and mobile and put her
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.320]   on the committee of nine or whatever that runs Google.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.320]   And it's a promotion.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.000]   And I think in really a way-- it's a way of saying--
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.800]   we were talking about how Facebook is jumping
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.080]   on social search.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:48.480]   I think Google's saying, eh, social-- that's so 2009.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.360]   We're going to do local and mobile search.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.520]   That's the future.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.640]   They're really open about that.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.160]   Any time you go to any Google event,
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:56.520]   they say that the future of Google
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.160]   is a future that's focused around mobile stuff.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.760]   So I think putting Marissa Meyer in charge
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:06.360]   is putting-- somebody who's been a key person in the past
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.680]   of Google into the thing where they're basically
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.120]   putting their major back moving forward.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.280]   It's interesting, isn't it?
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:18.720]   And I wonder if Facebook and Microsoft are--
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.120]   are they a step behind?
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.720]   No Facebook's doing local too.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:23.560]   They're doing places.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:28.200]   So they get it as well.
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:32.040]   Finally, we'll wrap up with this sad story.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.240]   The end of one of the great mathematicians,
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.760]   85-year-old Benoit Mandelbrot passed away on Thursday.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.040]   He's the guy who created the Mandelbrot set
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:43.560]   and really coined the term fractals
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:48.240]   and applied the concept of fractals.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.720]   And you know the scary part, Leo?
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.000]   What's that?
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.760]   There's a fractal involved in this.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.920]   It says we're all going to die.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:58.200]   That's a fractal?
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.360]   To people who are in the fractals, that's hilarious.
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.800]   Really, that was a fractal joke.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.160]   It was a fractal joke.
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:07.520]   But it got no laugh from this crowd,
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.240]   which is the way it's been all day.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.680]   I'm just not apparently up on higher order mathematics.
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.200]   That's all.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.840]   But I would like to end the show with Jonathan Colton's
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.440]   song about Benoit Mandelbrot before we do.
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.520]   I want to thank Harry McCracken for being here.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.920]   Technologizer.com, Harry.
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:25.720]   My pleasure.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:26.520]   Great job.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.120]   We love the technologizer.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.720]   A great place to go to find out what's going on.
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:34.520]   Deep thoughtful writing about technology.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.000]   Also--
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:35.200]   Thank you, sir.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:37.280]   Also, you've got to-- if you want
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.560]   to know what's going on in technology,
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:45.400]   you've got to read the link role at blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.880]   And Dwight's post in between add the insight that
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.200]   that make all the difference in the world.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:51.160]   We'd love having you on, Dwight.
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.080]   Thanks for joining me today.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:52.680]   I really appreciate it.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.680]   Thanks for having me, Leo.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.680]   This is always a blast.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:55.680]   Always fun to do.
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:56.160]   Great show.
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.280]   Really great show today.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.160]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:02.000]   No thanks to John C. Devorak, however.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:02.720]   Just teasing.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:08.000]   John is the man behind Twitch and channeled
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.240]   devorak.com proves it.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.240]   If you go to channeled devorak, you can see what John's up to.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.560]   Are you missing on Wednesdays?
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:15.480]   Are you missing the cranky geeks thing?
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.920]   Do you mind not doing that anymore?
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:17.240]   Is that correct?
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.080]   Mental show, we're going to start something up this week.
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.240]   We'll let you know--
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.440]   Well, anyone subscribing to the old cranky geeks
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:23.280]   feed will get something.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:23.800]   You're kidding.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.680]   So you took over the feed?
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.360]   Well, the feed has been coming out of me view.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.000]   We're just going to do something out of there.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:30.920]   It's not that hard to do.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.840]   There's actually a couple of different feeds.
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:36.120]   So will it be a tech round table featuring
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.560]   important journalists involved in technology,
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.600]   discussing the week's events?
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.760]   That would be unique.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:48.440]   Will they be cranky?
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:51.720]   Well, everybody's cranky when they're around me long enough.
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.880]   John also does a great show called No Agenda.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.240]   It only costs you $333.33 to be a producer of it.
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:01.400]   I invite you to check it out at noagendidot.com.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:04.720]   Noagendidotshow.com.
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:05.920]   And channeled devorak.com has it.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.680]   And you can also go listen to us live on the stream
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.360]   at noagendidotstream.com, which is also good.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:13.400]   It's so much more fun to listen live.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.240]   Well, you're the one that talked us into it.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.240]   I know I'm not just following your lead.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.640]   I love live.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.680]   Do we have--
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.000]   Eileen, do we want to promote anything coming up?
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.200]   We think we might have John Perry Barlow for a special one
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:26.960]   on one.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:29.440]   On Wednesday, we're waiting to hear from him.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.120]   We had a great interview with Wozniak, which
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.040]   is on the specials feed twit.tv/specials.
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:38.040]   You can watch us do this show every Sunday live, 3 p.m.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:45.120]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2,200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.520]   Do discuss in the background in the chat room.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.520]   We follow the chat room.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.040]   And it's really a good thing to have.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.680]   You have my brains externalized.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:54.640]   I-R-C.twit.tv.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.000]   And if you miss the show live, you can always subscribe
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.960]   at twit.tv.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.040]   And we have audio and video versions available.
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.880]   Thanks, everybody, for joining us.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:04.680]   We'll see you next week.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.240]   Another twit is in the can.

[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.140]   and you're just waiting anxiously to come up to me afterwards
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:36.140]   and point out the fact that the equation is not quite right,
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:39.140]   but I actually described the Julia set and not a mammal brush set.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:42.140]   I already know that, so you don't have to come up with it.
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.140]   This is amazing.
