[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.120]   We'll talk about taking cat pictures in the dark.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.240]   How many monthly fees are too many and why Tivo wants to put ads in my stream?
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.240]   It's all coming up next.

[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.360]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech the show we cover the weeks.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360]   Tech news.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.800]   We're going to have fun today.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.840]   My old friend from, I call you the hamburger from Tech Burger, the Houston Chronicles Tech
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   Burger.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.120]   Dwight Silverman is in the house.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   Hello, Dwight.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   Hey, how are you?
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   It's good to be here.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.960]   High and dry finally here in Houston.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   Where are we?
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.560]   You had like five storms in a row or something?
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.160]   Well, we had Tropical Storm Amelda which dumped in some of the deepest places about 43 inches.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.480]   It was for some people it was the same thing as Harvey and there was incredible flooding
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.360]   particularly between here and Beaumont.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.000]   And it's just we had a story on the front page today that said looked at the psychological
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.400]   impact of having all these floods and asking whether Houston is worth living in.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.160]   Oh my God.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.240]   I thought with the name of Amelda.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.720]   I thought and you're old enough to remember this reference.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.520]   I thought maybe shoes would rain down from the sky.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.080]   Yes, there were shoe jokes.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.720]   But it was serious and it was the kind of thing where it came through and it wasn't that much
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.600]   at first and then on the last day when it was around it dumped this huge band and this
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.640]   was on Thursday and it took everybody by surprise.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   School was still in and people just kind of got stuck where it was pretty bad.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.720]   It's our turn next because next month will be the anniversary of the fires in California.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.640]   Yeah, so we'll be looking forward to some of that.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.040]   Also with us from Wired Magazine, it's great to have Louise Metzakis.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.680]   Hi, Louise.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.240]   How are you?
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.200]   You're in beautiful New York where nothing bad happens.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.560]   Yeah, I'm in my living room and I have this, I always get comments on this and I do these
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   video shows.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.280]   I have this like old newsstand picture.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.840]   You love that.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.440]   Yeah, it's kind of fun for the apartment of a digital journalist but a lot of the magazines
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.440]   back there don't exist.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.440]   Mommy, what's a newsstand?
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.080]   What are magazines, Mommy?
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.480]   I think it is 1984.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.120]   Is it a photo or a painting?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.280]   It is a print.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   It is a print.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.680]   Yeah, yeah, so that's kind of fun to have.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.080]   It'd be a good stack of papers.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.400]   Maybe it's just me but every time I look at that I go, "Oh, I'd be a good jigsaw puzzle."
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.960]   Yeah, good puzzle for sure.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.120]   Yeah, we got the Gulf War up there.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.280]   A lot of good stuff on the covers of the magazines.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.760]   But yeah, I'm happy to be here.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.520]   Louise covers e-commerce online culture at Wired.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.920]   She's a staff writer there.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.680]   That is a great picture of you.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.320]   Thanks, yeah, that's what I look like in real life.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.240]   Yeah, she's black and white.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.520]   Inky eyes kind of soulless and TV shark eyes.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.040]   Also here, a guy who usually shows up on Tuesdays but we thought we'd bring him in for the iPhone
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   discussion.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   Renee Ritchie from Vector@imore.com.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   Hello Renee.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.800]   I showed up early and you were just kind enough to let me join you.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   I love having you.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   He's just going to stay through Tuesday.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.360]   I love having you on the show.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.600]   It's great to have you.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.400]   And I guess we probably should talk about the iPhone.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.920]   Actually tonight's the Emmys and Apple's already won a Creative Arts Emmy.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   They give those early.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.320]   Second year in a row for Carpool Karaoke.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.440]   Don't all jump up at once.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.600]   I was thinking like TV plus might change that next year.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.920]   I don't feel like Carpool Karaoke deserves an Emmy, especially without James Corden.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.480]   But okay, okay.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   Best show in a car?
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   I don't know what the criteria is.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.680]   Yeah, what is the case?
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.200]   Short form variety series.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.400]   How many of those are there?
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.160]   Yeah, what is another example like a Loser's here?
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   One.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   I wanted to make the musical.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.360]   I want an Emmy for exactly the same reason.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.200]   I was in the category specialty act.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.040]   Is that true?
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.280]   It was me and a sock puppet.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.240]   And it wasn't a hard thing to beat.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.560]   I kid you know.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.600]   Friends were lucky you weren't in their category.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   Maybe that's how they were thinking.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.320]   Yeah, those friends.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.960]   This was in 1996 or 97 when I was a virtual reality character.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.040]   And that was the only category they could put it in.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.200]   Because I was just like, you know, as an imaginary barista.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.600]   You're going to be on your desk.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   I do.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   I get that.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.560]   Oh, should have it just sitting here.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.480]   Yeah, I carry it with me everywhere, Dwight.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.200]   I'm always, you know, have you seen where is it like AirPods?
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.400]   It's only been 20 years.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   Have you seen Miami?
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.680]   That's why you call it football.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.440]   So, yeah, congratulations to Carpool.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   To you and Apple.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   In the short form variety series.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.440]   It's awesome.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   First Emmy.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.440]   No, no, this is even there.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   This is the second year in a row.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   Carpool karaoke is one.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   But it's a totally good show, right?
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.880]   There's only else Apple's over one Emmy for, right?
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880]   That's a good question.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.760]   And do you think given what you've seen of the new Apple shows on TV+, we've only seen
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.520]   the trailers that anything looks Emmy worthy?
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.920]   Maybe that morning news show.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   And the space show.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.760]   I don't think the space show pisses me off.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   Rawl mankind.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   Yeah, for all my kids.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.480]   It pisses me off because the premise is what if we didn't land on the moon first, the Soviets
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.480]   did?
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.120]   Well, screw you, we did.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.120]   But then the space was never ends.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   The hell with you.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   Yeah, but no.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.200]   I don't like that premise.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.960]   We did land first, but they never got there.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.800]   I know, but now in their universe, the space race goes on.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.000]   So there's better space development.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.480]   No, yes.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.880]   It works out better.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   It works out better.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.040]   Is the Soviet Union still in business in this show?
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   Maybe.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.040]   Maybe.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.080]   It's kind of like the space version of the man in the high castle.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.080]   Yes.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.120]   In fact, I guarantee you, Dwight, that's how they pitched it.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.120]   Oh, sure.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.040]   It's the space version of the man in the high castle.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.040]   Oh, you're in the high shuttle.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.320]   In the high shuttle.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.400]   So a lot of interest to that here in Houston because we're where we want to see how it
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   came out.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   Yeah, who really won?
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.880]   It's just it's just I feel like here we are.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   Next year will be Marvel versus it'll be a Disney versus Apple vying for those categories
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.440]   and who can spend the most on the campaigns.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.200]   I just feel like it's the 50th anniversary this year of landing on the moon.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.520]   There's been already that horrible man on the moon movie, which just pissed me off because
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.160]   it implied that Neil Armstrong's family distress was more important than him being the first
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   person on the moon.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.120]   He just peeved me no end.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   And then they do that.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.000]   It's like, come on, guys, this was an important thing.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.280]   So speaking of important things, much more important than landing on the moon, I've got
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.520]   a camera.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.160]   Three of them on my iPhone now.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160]   Three lenses.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.160]   So many lenses, Leo, somebody lenses.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   So you want to take a selfie?
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.600]   We could do a a selfie.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.640]   You want to do a selfie?
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.600]   Let me see if I can get you all in.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.320]   I got to pretend like I have hair.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.600]   No, you know what, Renee, you're too far over in this in the for the slow fee.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.520]   Why didn't he wasn't there like a new widening?
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.520]   Yeah, I got you.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   I got 85 85 degrees wide angle.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.520]   So there you go.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.520]   Hey, you have to do something.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.680]   You have to move if it's a slow fee.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.720]   Here's my like, here's my set.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   Here's my slow fee.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   Oh my God.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.000]   You know what, I'll post this on the interwebs.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Great.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.280]   Is there a slofy.com yet?
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.600]   Yes, you know, it's funny.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.560]   That's a painful subject, a sore subject.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.560]   You mentioned that.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.560]   Funny you mentioned that.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.400]   So we're doing the event on Tuesday, Mike, a sergeant and I, you know, we do that stream.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.920]   How do I get the movie to play again?
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.280]   Oh, there's the play button.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.920]   This is, this is a slow fee.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.920]   That's artistic.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   Isn't that artistic?
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.720]   I'm putting that on my, I'm an influencer now.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.640]   So Mike, a sergeant and I are watching the event and they do the slow fee thing and he
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   quickly starts typing and I see he's on hover.com.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.080]   I thought, Oh God, he's going to try to register.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.240]   Slofy.com and he's a Wawa.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   Slofy.com.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   I did he registered.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240]   Slofy.com.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   He got slofy.net.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.800]   But it spelled S-L-O-P-H-I-E.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.640]   And I said,
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.160]   I think it's spelled with an F.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.240]   Yes, slofy is the science.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.400]   Slofy with an F is the camera.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.960]   I think he ought to do.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.160]   There should be a site there of just spectacular fails.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.160]   So, that's slofy.com.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.160]   I don't know.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   I don't care.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.560]   Don't you think Apple goes, Phil Schiller, you know, the day before the event goes out
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   and registers all that stuff.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   Ha ha ha.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.840]   That's not strict out.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.400]   The like who is?
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400]   Let's see.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   Does it?
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.320]   Oh, it appears to be owned by Google.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   What?
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   Oh, that's great.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.880]   That's great.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   Well played Google.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   Well played.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.320]   I spoke too soon.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.480]   I spoke too soon.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.400]   It's registered through Google domains probably, right?
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.960]   Yeah, they're the registrar.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.440]   They're not the registrant.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   They're not the person who's registered.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.480]   It is kind of funny if Apple registered through Google domains.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   That would be kind of humorous.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.840]   Yeah, no, it looks like whoever has it is private.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.080]   Whoever has it.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.080]   It's Apple.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.080]   It's got an ugly Sergey Brin.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.080]   Not Sergey Brin.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.080]   Who has slofy sucks.com?
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:34.560]   Oh, that's always the interesting one to have.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.000]   So you have one Dwight.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.040]   I have an iPhone 11 pro flonks.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   Yes.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.360]   I've already taken cat pictures in the dark.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   Nice.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.960]   And they look great.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   All right.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   They look great.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.680]   It's really the video, the photo quality.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.880]   So this is my cat.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.680]   The room was actually pretty dark.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.120]   And whoa.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.920]   That looks perfectly brightly lit.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.240]   It looks like a normal lighting.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.400]   And this is mostly what I do with my camera is cat pictures in the dark.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.200]   So I'm really excited.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.800]   If you put it on a tripod, you can get an astrophotography picture of your cat in the
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.360]   dark.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.720]   I've seen people doing that.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.800]   I've seen like Skyfoff already with those.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   28 seconds.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   Really?
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.000]   Using focus or using the Apple app?
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.200]   No, using the Apple app.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.600]   But it'll only come on when it detects no movements.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.960]   You've got to put it on a tripod.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.320]   And then it'll let you pull the little dial all the way to 28.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.760]   Scooping Google a little bit on that one because of course, astrophotography is one of the
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:45.000]   things Google talked about in the sneakily released.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.280]   Actually, this is an interesting question.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.280]   There was a video, promo video of the Pixel 4, which isn't out yet.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.160]   Google presumably announcing it October 15th.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.160]   And there was a video that was leaked somehow.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.960]   Somebody got it and showed it and showed astrophotography.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.160]   And there is, I think some people think Google intentionally does these leaks.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   I'm sure you do.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   They do in this case.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   They actually have.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.920]   Well, this year they've admitted it.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.680]   They said, well, because of all the leaks, we're going to show you the back of the phone.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.440]   But this one was nobody took credit for this.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.760]   This was a leaked.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   What is that you have?
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.360]   Oh, I think that's the astrophotography.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.320]   Oh, so you did it?
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.320]   You put it on the tripod.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.120]   And then if you tap the little yellow icon, it gives you a dial and you can pull it down
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.280]   to zero to turn night mode off, normally up to three to go to full night mode.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.000]   But if it's totally stable, you can pull it all the way to 28 and then just sit there
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.320]   while it slowly dissolves all the stars in the sky, which is pretty neat.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.640]   There really is parity between Google and Apple at this point in terms of, you know,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   we did a test.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:52.080]   We took out the P30 Pro, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, the Pixel 3 and the iPhone and the
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   iPhone 11.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.840]   And just to make sure it wasn't me, I brought like a head to a husband of Android Central
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.080]   and Michael Fisher, who does Mr. Mobile and we all three did it together.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.480]   And the way I would sum it up is, so Huawei has magnificent hardware, absolutely stunning
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.840]   hardware with terrible color science and algorithms.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.400]   And Google has mediocre camera hardware with the world's most spectacular algorithms.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.520]   Samsung is just, I don't know, they're like trying their best.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.920]   They turned my beard into plastic, which was very unusual.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.560]   They over-
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.160]   And Apple simultaneously over-
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160]   Yes.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   And over-
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   And over-
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160]   And over-
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   Yes.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.360]   And it's like you get the worst.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.360]   It's like Schmiry and-
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.360]   And-
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.360]   So, Miry.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.360]   Apple's got pretty good hardware and pretty good algorithms.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.120]   Not as good hardware as Huawei, not as good algorithms as Google, but because they have
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.880]   both of them, like 100% photo pixels and a really good light intake plus pretty good
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.080]   algorithms, they managed to compete with Google.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.560]   And I think that's pretty interesting.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.600]   Honestly, for normal people, they'd be happy with any of those.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   Really?
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.600]   I don't think they're going to-
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.000]   It's only if you compare them side by side that you even could see-
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Do I see the white cat look plastic and bright green?
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   You might have to be so happy.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.240]   I still think that the iPhone video is the best.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.000]   Oh, everybody agrees on that.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.760]   And I think that's increasingly important.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   Like even if you have amazing still photography, if you can't get a great video with the kind-
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.040]   Like with the needs of the average person, they want to upload like videos to TikTok
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.360]   and stuff.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.800]   And the new image stabilization is pretty amazing.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.040]   I just thought of 60 frame per second, interleaved, extended dynamic range TikTok Leo.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.240]   That's where our culture is going.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   What?
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   Are you talking about?
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.880]   The new iPhone camera shoots- It shoots 120 frames per second, uses half of that for
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.680]   extended dynamic range, and makes a 60 frames per second 4K video, and it could be a TikTok
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   meme.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.800]   I'm just saying.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:52.200]   Here is from Reddit a post showing image stabilization in the new- The far left is- Same thing, the
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.000]   guy's running along in a field on the far left is the iPhone 11 Pro Max.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.400]   The middle is the 10S Max.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   The right is the Note 10.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.880]   And it's pretty clear that the image stabilization in the 11 is really good on the far left.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.240]   That's the smoothest of the three.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.400]   Now that's- You know- They're trying hard to keep the color the same as you move through
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.160]   different lighting situations.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.360]   I wish he'd gone into shadow because that would have been an interesting test of it.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.640]   Nevertheless, that's impressive.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.480]   I agree with you, Louise.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.360]   I think especially- And it's not out yet, but they showed this on stage at the Apple
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.440]   event.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.680]   When Filmic Pro comes out, which is a third-party app, it will- Apparently, this is a
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.920]   feature in iOS 13.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.120]   It will be able to shoot video from two or more of the lenses.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:46.400]   So you can have the selfie cam on at the same time as you have the back camera on and tape
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.680]   an interview and record both sides of the interview.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.000]   And then in editing, you don't have to do a second.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.640]   And you're close up and wide angle and you can switch between them in the editing.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.360]   Do you know Renee yet?
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.880]   It's not out yet.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.320]   But if that will use more- I got to try it.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.320]   You did get to track.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.560]   More than two lenses?
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.560]   So I got conflicting information on it.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.080]   But a couple people said it was limited to two, but the demo I did was shooting all four.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.280]   So I don't know if that's what the real capability is or if that was something they're experimenting
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.840]   with and they're not sure they're going to launch, but the demo I did with it was four
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.160]   cameras.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.160]   So imagine that.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.800]   I mean, I'm thinking of taking this to CES because then I could shoot a close-up, a
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.760]   wide angle.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.360]   I mean, I could have my image on there.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.760]   I mean, that's- Your reaction shots, Leo.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.520]   What that's a testament to- That's a testament to actually the speed of the processor, right?
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.880]   And the speed of the storage that it can do.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.400]   Let's back up a little bit.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.800]   What would you do with all four?
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.160]   Like what would you- Edit them.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.000]   So here's the scenario, Luis.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.160]   You put them together later.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.640]   Yeah, I'm at CES.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.200]   I get them all recording.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.440]   And then when I edit it, I can have a wide angle of me standing there with a guy.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.680]   I can have a picture of me asking him questions, close-up of the product.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.360]   I can have all of that.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.640]   And then our editors pick and choose- It's like a four-camera shoot.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.440]   Of course, the camera's in the same position.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.960]   So it's not as good as a four-camera shoot.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.520]   But it's- Well, I mean, that's a lot.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.800]   I think the two or three make sense, but the four is like-
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.200]   Four is more than you need.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.000]   Yeah, I think that's more than you need.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Yeah, four is more so.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.800]   I can tell you there- I can tell you in newsrooms, there's a lot of discussion about this particular
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.600]   camera and the use of it for journalism.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:31.000]   And being able, as you said, to do interviews, to show events as they happen and have narration
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.400]   at the same time, a lot of photojournalists are really interested in this.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.200]   Well, I'm sure all of you have done this.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.760]   I certainly have.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.720]   You know, when you're going out in the field to do reporting, very often there's-
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.600]   You go with a camera crew, but there's only one camera.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.120]   And you're doing an interview.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.440]   So you have to do the dumbest thing, which is you ask your subject-
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.760]   The camera's pointing at the subject.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.120]   You ask him a bunch of questions.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.600]   He records his answers.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.560]   Then you go, "Thank you very much.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.560]   Goodbye."
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.400]   The camera goes and starts pointing at you.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.400]   And now you have to pretend.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   You have to go, "Mm-hmm."
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   Yep.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   "Mm-hmm."
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.320]   You have to pretend you're listening to the guy, which is totally phony because you can't-
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.400]   Because you only have one camera, so you can't get that shot unless you do it twice.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   That Jeff Bridges movie-
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   Right.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   That Jeff Bridges movie, that network-
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   It wasn't network.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.600]   It was him and Holly Hunter.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.240]   They did the- It was a trope on that.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.240]   Wasn't Jeff Bridges?
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.240]   Yes.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.240]   No, it was the other guy.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.440]   You're talking about broadcast news.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440]   Broadcast.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440]   It wasn't Jeff Edward.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.120]   Jeff, it was- What's his name?
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   It's the wooden guy.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.120]   Right.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.120]   The guy made out of wood.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.120]   Yes.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   That actor.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.120]   Oh, that one.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   Chattering will tell us in a second.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.800]   Yeah, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   But everybody's done it.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.880]   If you've done any TV, that's how they do it because it's very rarely would you have
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.040]   two cameras.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   William Hurt.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   That's the actor-
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.840]   For some reason, I always get him and Jeff Bridges mixed up.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   I don't know why.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   Underboard Ross.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.480]   They're not even close.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.720]   One's the dude.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.680]   One's the wooden guy.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.440]   They're the same person in my-
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   All right.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.240]   I don't want to make this an iPhone, isn't it great thing?
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.280]   But I guess we need to cover it a little bit.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.080]   I think there's a lot of people who watch these iPhone events and say, "Oh, I've got
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   to have the new one."
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.640]   And then as I did, and then- But I have to get it anyway.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.840]   I get it and I go, "Well, yeah, it's nice.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.800]   It was not 1,000 or, in my case, $1,459 nice."
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.760]   And Louise, you're still using a six- What, a six-s, eight?
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.200]   No, I have seven plus is what I have.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.560]   And you're perfectly happy.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.360]   And from 90% of what you do, it's the same, right?
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.080]   Yeah, I will say that camera thing for work is very compelling.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:57.840]   But at the same time, I'm just hesitant to, will that be enough to compel me to buy another
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.600]   $1,000 phone that I know the screen is going to break?
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.120]   Like, I know there's going to be problems with it.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.200]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.560]   I haven't found something that really compelled me to upgrade.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.400]   I think now the phone's also really looked the same.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.200]   I will say the one thing that kind of was compelling to me is I think they did the colors
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.640]   really nicely this year.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.320]   Like, I love the new color.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   Okay.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.160]   That's a terrible reason to buy a phone.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.160]   Great, exactly.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.360]   But yeah, show us the color of your current phone.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.520]   I have some stickers on it.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.360]   Yeah, you don't care.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.600]   You got a case and stickers on it.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.080]   But it's a blue black one, yeah.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.240]   But I will say, like, you know, like, hold up the new one.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.160]   Like, how different do they really look aside from the camera, right?
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   The camera.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.960]   It's a terminated camera is the thing.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   Right.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   Weird camera.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.560]   And like, I do think that's kind of compelling.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.400]   But yeah, see, like, even the black one here, like that one really just looks like my phone,
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   except for the camera.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   Right.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.920]   Look, yeah, normal people.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:05.600]   It's all it's, it's those of us in the tech press who are saying, Oh, that A13 bionic has
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:11.080]   24 pipelines and six cores plus it's got, I mean, it's, it's in a very impressive chip.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.400]   Actually, Oh, Malek in was wired, right?
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:18.040]   Oh, Malek did a whole, uh, owed to the A13.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.880]   Well, okay.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.680]   I will say in normal people's defense, I do think that there are a couple of things that
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.360]   are really compelling about these new devices for normal people.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.600]   And the big one is the battery, right?
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   That is huge.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   Yes.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   And that is a huge thing for a lot of people.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.800]   And I think that's a, but I, yeah, I just don't know, like how much better is your Instagram
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.840]   going to be, even though these cameras are a lot more powerful.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.680]   But I do think you know, for teens filming TikToks, having that front and back facing
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.560]   camera honestly might be a game changer.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.360]   Like there's going to be new forms of content because of that.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   And that might be something that people have FOMO about because there are a lot of, uh,
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.440]   kinds of TikToks and a lot of YouTube videos and these sorts of things that have that exactly
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.240]   as you said, the fake two shots because it's only one.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.240]   The slofy.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.520]   Gotta have the slofy, baby.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.800]   I think that is wrong.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   I think that.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.120]   I think that is why that is not going to be a good idea.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.440]   If anything, like where I feel like mean culture is going is beating it up.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.560]   Like most me is most are sped up.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560]   They're not slowed down.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.600]   This is why we have you on Louise, you have your finger on the pulse of the eutes.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.200]   I'm addicted to TikTok.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.400]   That's what I say.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   Oh, that's right.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   I forgot.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   You're the TikTok queen.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   Yes, I love TikTok.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.560]   I really said commentary that they're designing phones now for teens filming TikToks.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   Well, I mean, they're a big consumer based, right?
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.840]   Like you gotta get it's hooked and you're like, it's going to, it's what do they want
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.840]   for Christmas?
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.480]   I think that's going to be a big driver.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.280]   And I think a lot of teens too, and like younger people are the ones who are like, hey, mom,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.760]   dad, like you need to upgrade your phone because you need to have X feature or whatever.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760]   Right.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.600]   Because I think it's moms who are like, you know, my mom still has an iPhone six.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.560]   But like if I don't tell her you need to upgrade, like, why would she?
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   My mom won't.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   I tried to get her upgraded and she says, no, I like my headphone jack.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.560]   Thank you.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.560]   There you go.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.560]   Exactly.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.160]   That's a big thing too.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.800]   So one big thing about upgrading particularly this year, I was not going to get, I've had
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.560]   a 10S Max.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.600]   I was not going to get the Pro Max until I saw what the camera could do and I became really
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.880]   intrigued by that.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.800]   I also was really interested in the extra five hours of battery life in the Max.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:40.200]   But let me ask you though, Renee and Dwight, because you've got it.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.720]   Have you noticed like the battery?
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.960]   I mean, I guess we haven't had it long enough to.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.880]   Haven't had it long enough.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:51.840]   But I, you know, the thing that actually tipped me over was I'm on the iPhone upgrade
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.120]   plan.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:59.400]   And I've been paying, you know, per month for, you know, a couple of models now and I definitely
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.520]   wanted to get the one next year because it likely will have 5G.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.560]   I still would be paying on my 10S Max through next year.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.560]   Why not go ahead and keep paying and have the newer one?
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.400]   And so I went ahead and did it with all the other factors and I think the way people pay
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.800]   for it now has become a real factor in terms of why or whether they upgrade.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   Right.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.120]   And then I finally paid off my seven and that's why I don't want to get another one because
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.880]   I'm like, I don't want to add that bill.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.440]   And that's an interesting point because I wonder, well, people consider that charge when they're
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.160]   thinking about these new Apple services.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.400]   Like, well, they think about what I'm already paying $40 for my iPhone a month.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:42.080]   I really want to pay another 20 bucks for gaming or, and others are like, you know, Apple
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.480]   News and all this other stuff.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.800]   Like, I wonder if people will psychologically consider what they're already paying to Apple
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.720]   or if they won't, you know, if they'll consider those things the way they can get the money
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.440]   to think about Netflix or whatever, which is what Apple wants, I think.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.440]   What do real people think?
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.960]   You know, I asked some people who were lined up.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   They had the big 5th Avenue Apple store reopening on Thursday and they had the lineups on Friday.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   Did you go there?
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   Yes, sir.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   I want to hear about that.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   Go ahead.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   Okay.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.320]   So I asked, you know, I've heard this answer over and over again and there's always at
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.000]   least a few people in line who say, this is the camera I take the photos of my children
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   with.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.240]   I will never be able to go back in time and get better photos of them.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.360]   So every year I want to take the absolute best photos I can.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.080]   And that's when they see a compelling camera update, they take it.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.200]   So get a good camera for crying out loud.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.960]   What are you doing with a iPhone?
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.960]   She's.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.120]   I mean, it's easier to carry.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   It's easier to carry.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.120]   You don't.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.120]   Sorry.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   I have a wrist strap for my camera.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.120]   I just put it on my wrist.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.320]   Actually, I shouldn't say that because I dropped my brand new camera.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:48.120]   The first day I had it, it landed on my brand new lens, snapped the hood off.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.720]   I have to bring the lens in for repair and the cameras are all scratched up.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.600]   So yeah, maybe I should stick with the phone when you're talking about a kid or a pet or
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.360]   something, time from pocket to snap is really important.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.920]   And the reliability of it actually recording that image is really important.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.400]   I think I think Louise actually is probably speaking for a lot of people with it.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.840]   You know, my phone is good enough and I don't feel like I need to do it.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.160]   It's paid off.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.080]   And I don't really see the benefit to it.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.000]   You know, the one you have, Louise, the seven plus, that's a great camera.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.880]   That camera is one of my favorite iPhone cameras.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.880]   The colors were great.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.120]   It's 98% of what the new one is, except for a few weird features like.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.680]   And every month is like, you know, not nothing.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   Right.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:38.160]   Well, I want to, I want to address that question you asked, which is when do people stop saying
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.520]   I can't pay yet another monthly fee?
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.480]   Is Apple counting on you buying TV plus an arcade and Apple news, Apple music?
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.000]   They've got a lot of monthly fees.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.800]   Yeah, like you can be paying basically $100 at this point for your iPhone plan.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.000]   Plus, if you're getting all of the extra services, right?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.440]   And I don't know if people are making that connection because that $4 payment is showing
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.200]   up on your cell phone bill.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.300]   So I don't know if a lot of people really realize like what's happening when they go
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.040]   and sign up and get the contract and get the phone or whatever.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.800]   I don't know if they really, you know, understand.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   It's worse.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   Let me ask you this.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.520]   Is it worse to pay 40 bucks plus 10 bucks plus 10 bucks plus five bucks?
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.960]   But is that really selling?
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.000]   Is that worse than paying 65 bucks?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.600]   Is that like, which is worse or is it the same?
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.360]   Do people know in their head, oh, it's 65 bucks either way?
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.920]   Incremental sneaks up on you.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   I feel like it's worse.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.840]   I feel like nobody wants to have four bills.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.600]   They're like you're chipping away at your financial success.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   I can ask you this, Leo.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.600]   I forgot iCloud.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   Yeah, there's another one.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   Yes, go ahead.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   Yeah, no, so like, I remember, you know, when I was younger and I wanted to subscribe to
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.520]   comic books or magazines or you go to the newsstand and you could never buy every magazine
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.120]   or every comic on the newsstand.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.720]   So you had to pick and choose the ones they're most important to you.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.040]   And I got like three or four subscriptions a year, mostly on my birthday or the holidays.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.040]   And that was it.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.040]   I had to make do.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.120]   And you never got the biggest cable package.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.440]   You had to choose sort of the one that fit your budget.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.840]   And there was no streaming music.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.200]   So you had to pick which CDs every month you could buy.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.040]   I think our attitudes have changed and that now we just expect everything.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.320]   And music has already been smashed down.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.440]   So music is instead of buying a bunch of CDs every month is one rate.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.520]   Magazines are now smashed down.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.080]   So you never you don't have to choose anymore which magazines you got.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.720]   You're getting all the magazine, pretty much all the magazines expect effectively for one
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   price.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   TV is still a mess.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.520]   You still have to choose the TV and that may not change for a while.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.440]   But we're getting vastly more content.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.640]   We can't even conceal the amount of content we're getting.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.840]   And just because there's more available, we feel like we're compelled to have to get it
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   all.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.880]   I mean, I agree with that.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.760]   And I think it's kind of you do need to still pick and choose.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.680]   Like, you know, I think that if you're really trying to get every streaming service at this
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.960]   point, but what people do, I think is that everyone has access to almost every streaming
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.640]   service because they're getting their friends password.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.800]   That's what you young people are doing.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.480]   Or they do it one month, right?
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.000]   They switch every month with different service and binge everything they want.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Big deal.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Sure.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.280]   Well, I'm going to drop Apple news because I have discovered we have a company account
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.440]   for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.240]   The main reason I got Apple news because I wanted to have Wall Street Journal content.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.920]   And now I have it through the company.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   I'm going to don't have to.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:27.640]   So I have no problem dropping and adding things like I will pick up HBO now only when
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.280]   there's something on that I want to see and I'll drop it and I go back and forth.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.360]   And pretty much my subscription thing stays about the same and stays relatively tolerable
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:42.200]   because I have no mercy in terms of spending a lot of brain cycles on juggling all this
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   stuff.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   It's easier now though too.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.880]   Don't most people just subscribe and subscribe and subscribe.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.640]   And then one year they look at their billing and go, my God, I've got a lot of.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.200]   No, the price increase comes.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.240]   And when the price increase comes, what Netflix is it?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   13,000 dollars a month now?
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   What?
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   No, that's a good point.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   When YouTube TV went from 35 bucks to 50 bucks, I canceled it.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.240]   It was like, okay.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.960]   And Netflix has gone up like three times I think over the last few years.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.560]   On the other hand, there's another model that's even worse and that's Tivo's model.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:17.720]   So you pay 500 bucks for a Tivo and then 200 bucks for the lifetime subscription cable
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   guide.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.360]   So I'm now 700 bucks in on a Tivo and Tivo just announced, oh, and by the way, we're
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.280]   going to put an ad at the beginning of all your DVR recordings.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.520]   You pay for the movie ticket.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.520]   You're stuck in the theater.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520]   I want my money back.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520]   I hate you.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.520]   That's awful.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.520]   And it's just an ad.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.800]   It's not the end of the world, but I bought a DVD player and it had ads.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.320]   I paid for the DVD player.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.320]   I took it back.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.720]   I just couldn't, I could not handle it.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.160]   I remember my Samsung TV, which show ads it was just.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.160]   My Samsung DVD player showed out it took a buy.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.840]   Why something for that kind of money or Blu-ray player?
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.840]   Sorry.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.840]   So 700 bucks out on it.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.720]   And actually that's just one Tivo and I have three or four in my house.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.400]   But advertisers will always pay more than consumers and they want that money too.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.760]   I wish there were some way I could cancel my Tivo subscription, but I can't because
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.720]   it was all upfront.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.560]   I mean, I think for some reason, I think one of the most offensive advertising after you
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.400]   buy is the like screen savers on the Kindle.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:21.200]   So you guys seen these is always the most insane book you've ever seen because like,
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.280]   it's not a bestseller and it's just like on your Kindle where your Kindle are sitting
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.480]   there like that's just.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.720]   But Louise, to be fair, you bought the ad subsidized Kindle.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.040]   You didn't buy the, you have a choice.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.040]   No way.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.840]   You can make that go away, but it's just, you know, you have this device in your house.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.000]   It's the same thing with the TV.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.800]   It's the, you know, but I think it's just so funny to watch those screen savers go on.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.000]   They're kind of amusing, but yeah, that's kind of the model that we've got ourselves
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.680]   into and you're right.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.800]   Appertizers are always going to pay more for that than the consumers want to.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.880]   But I just think we're in this, you know, subscription economy right now.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.120]   And I don't really know how it's going to play out and who the winners and losers are
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.120]   going to be.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.000]   It's an interesting world we live in.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.560]   Now I'll tell you one subscription that Apple has launched that I think deserves more attention.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.760]   It kind of got swamped by the iPhone.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.320]   But for five bucks, arcade is a great deal.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   You're great.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   It's so much fun.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   It's getting great.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.820]   It's so much fun.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.000]   And that's a five bucks I'm happy to spend because I'd spend that much probably.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.240]   And it's for the family.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.240]   Right.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240]   And I can do it on my TV.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.000]   The thing that killed me over this weekend is I bought like, so my God, kids are going
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.680]   to be using my switch so much that I basically don't have ownership of it anymore.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.320]   So I bought the new one for them with the better processor and the better battery life.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.080]   And then I found out that the games are locked to the console, not to the account.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   >> What?
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.760]   >> If I want to keep, yeah, it's like they've got this incredibly rigid copy protection
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.360]   where you have to buy the physical cartridges repeatedly if you have them on different.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   >> Oh, that's awesome.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.080]   >> Matthew Parens, Reno, Stephen Kovac, we're trying to explain it.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.640]   And then I'm thinking Apple Arcade is five bucks a month for the whole family.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.520]   And I'll just, they have iPads, they have iPhones, like older versions of my iPhones.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.600]   They can still play on them.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.240]   >> The games aren't- >> And so I'm like, that's it.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.040]   >> The games aren't quite as good as the Nintendo Switch though.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.720]   >> Nowhere near, but there's unlimited amounts of them.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.280]   And in patience, I think is a bigger, like you buy the console and you feel duty bound
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.440]   because it was 60 bucks to finish everything.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.560]   But these you can just download and play at your leisure.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.760]   >> They're kind of, forgive me, this is not a good image.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.480]   They're kind of toilet games.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.480]   >> Right.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.960]   So this is my question is like- >> That's a terrible image, isn't it?
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   I'm so sorry.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   >> Actually the car games.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.920]   >> Back, thank you, backseat of the car games.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.880]   >> But you know, this is still a big change in consumer behavior.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.360]   And it'll be interesting to see because Apple taught everyone that these games were supposed
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.360]   to be free, right?
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.520]   That they were just gonna be ad supported.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.440]   >> I think they feel guilty, Louise.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.840]   I think Apple says we screwed up.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.200]   We changed the game ecosystem, made all these freemium games.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.680]   Everybody's pissed off about it.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.680]   No?
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   Who's everyone?
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.200]   The developers are pissed off about it.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   >> No, developers love it.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.440]   They make a lot of money.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.440]   Look at Fortnite.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.440]   Look at Tim Sweeney.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   >> Well, the big studios love it.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.480]   I think the indie game devs are pretty not un-plussed about it.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.120]   And those ads are, you're right, it's a toilet game.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:14.520]   It's like, shit, ad pops up on the toilet game and you're like, oh, but you're fine with
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.520]   it.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.640]   And I think that was what Apple kind of taught us was okay, right?
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.800]   And so I think the idea of paying a monthly fee for that and having it be a little bit
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.280]   more elevated is appealing to a lot of people.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.200]   But it was this belief that you could just download this cheap game, right?
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   And I don't know.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.560]   Are people going to want to subscribe in that way?
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.080]   I think that's a shit.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.280]   >> Not every game is Fortnite.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.600]   I've spent a lot of money because Fortnite, you can actually play without buying anything.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   You may be mocked by your peers for having it.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.600]   >> If you want the Batman's--
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   >> Average costume.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   >> You want the Batman's to--
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.480]   >> Oh, you're such a default.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.040]   But you can play and the game's still fun.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:57.600]   But like Simpson's tapped out, I spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on donuts.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   >> And--
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   >> I want incubators, Leo.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.600]   I want to think about it.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.360]   >> Yeah, or whatever redfish or whatever it is.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.960]   And that, I think in the long run it upsets people.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.760]   So the idea that-- I think-- I feel like Apple almost was trying to create-- they created
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.440]   a crack in the cosmos and they're trying to heal it by doing--
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.360]   >> And no big studios will do it and it's fine.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.560]   They'll still have their games, big franchises will still have their spot and there'll be
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.560]   a bunch of other stuff.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.760]   But for people who just don't want that anymore or want an alternative to it, they have some--
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.760]   they at least have an alternative.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.960]   >> Did you have a game you like on it?
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.840]   >> You know, I haven't had too much time to play because I've been doing like a just
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.120]   exelient other things.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   But I'm blanking on the name.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.200]   I like the card game where you go into the subconscious of the kid and you're playing through
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   his memories.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   >> Yeah, it's like the 90's.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   >> And you're manipulating the cards to have them.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   Yeah, it's card drop or something.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.240]   It's totally blank on the name and you're building little traverses, puzzles for him.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.600]   >> And cards fall?
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.520]   >> Yes, yes, thank you, sir.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.520]   >> Okay.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.480]   >> No one's playing games are good.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.480]   >> Which ones?
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.360]   >> It's no man, they have a couple of games on there.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.720]   They made Altos-- I think they made Altos adventure.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.720]   >> Oh, Altos is good.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.720]   >> And they've got a couple of games on here.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.640]   >> So I think that that's what's happening is you see the same names, like each studio
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.920]   made several games or a lot of the studio had several games.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.360]   And they're not super complex.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.400]   Oceanhorn is as complex as the original Oceanhorn was, Oceanhorn 2.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.600]   I like the what the golf for people who hate golf.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   >> Yes.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.640]   >> It's so much fun.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.280]   You think you're going to shoot a ball and then it turns out you're shooting a house
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.840]   or a car or a kid or a club or what.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.480]   All sorts of weird stuff.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.960]   It's a very fun game.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.560]   Somebody in the chat room says he hated the Frogger game, but I kind of like that.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.360]   >> That's I think the nostalgia play.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.680]   You're like, people can recognize that brand name and then they can let me latch onto.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.880]   >> It's giant babies.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.360]   That's fun.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.800]   Do you play any arcade games Dwight at all?
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.120]   >> I have not yet signed up for it for about the same reason that Renee mentioned he had
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.000]   a chance to play.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.760]   I've got the beta of TVOS 13 right now on my Apple TV.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.880]   I'm kind of waiting for it to show up there.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.520]   So far I don't have access to it there.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.160]   But once I do that's what I'm most interested in, see what this looks like on the bigger
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   screen.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:14.240]   A bunch of people in the studio who are developers, VR game developers, they came out for the
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.080]   Oculus conference.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.880]   What do you guys think of arcade?
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.200]   There's no VR version.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.400]   >> It's not on the iPad.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.160]   >> You don't have it yet.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.960]   You'll get a Tuesday.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   >> It's only not.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.960]   I do have it.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   I've played lots of games.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   >> It's not on an iPad.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.960]   It's on the iPhone.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   The arcade's been really cool.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   >> Yeah, for the moment.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.960]   That's right.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   >> I'm playing on an iPad.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   >> Oh.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   >> You need the beta.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.960]   >> You're on the beta.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.640]   >> You need 13 and 1.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.720]   It's great on the iPad.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.360]   But it's actually a lot of the games are designed for the phone, I think.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.360]   >> That's a good thing.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   >> Do you think it's a good thing?
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.360]   >> Yeah, I know.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.440]   I know I'm just an iOS developer.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.600]   I think generally it's pretty toxic or cash for stuff.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   >> They don't like that.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   They don't want to be doing it.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   >> Especially indie devs.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   It's pretty bad.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.120]   >> You get a lot of hate from parents.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.320]   >> Yeah, you've got words like wails and all these big words.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.720]   And you need a lot of cash to prime and cluster acquisition, all these things, which
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.720]   are all the things that are going to be happening.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.400]   >> What I worry a little bit about is that arcade's going to eat up the rest of the
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.160]   industry that people, I mean, anybody who spends five bucks a month in arcade has 100
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.400]   games, new games all the time.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.840]   Why should I ever buy another game?
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.840]   I got them all.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.760]   >> Well, that's the one at Fortnite, Leo.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   >> Maybe.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.760]   Fortnite, yeah.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.680]   But see, Fortnite is such an outlier.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.240]   You can't ever use it in this conversation.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.120]   >> But the other ones were too hard to market.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.920]   Like I talked to a bunch of developers there and they had dreams to make games that there
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:39.560]   was just no either they would have to butcher them so thoroughly with a to play features
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.520]   that they would not live themselves to launch it, or they just couldn't launch it.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.440]   And this is giving them an outlet for all kinds of things.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.960]   >> That's the sense I get when I play these games is these are, in some ways, these are
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.360]   art projects.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.520]   These are games, labors of love that developers wanted to make but couldn't really make, it
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.520]   made no business.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.120]   >> Especially for the Mac or Apple TV, there was no way that they would have the time of
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.760]   resources to make those versions.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:06.040]   I think it's the thing problem Apple is, is they have so much power.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:11.040]   So they did that with freemium by allowing that and not allowing demo versions of games.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.840]   You know, by kind of steering the developer, they steered the developer into this freemium
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.680]   model, not I don't think intentionally, but accidentally.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.640]   And now I think they felt a little guilty about it.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.280]   So they've created arcade.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.560]   They have so much clout though that this could really change gaming in some dramatic ways.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.560]   >> But in a good way.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.880]   >> Well, maybe in a good way, maybe not.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:35.600]   I mean, if the experience overall becomes better, if it doesn't become, if it takes away a
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.760]   lot of the pain points or the annoyances, I think that overall it's a good thing.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:45.200]   The question is whether it will have an impact anywhere else or whether Apple will just be
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.760]   this island.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.600]   >> It's gonna kill Candy Crush.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   That is good.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   Everybody agrees.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   That is good, right?
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   >> So what are some of the annoyances?
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.680]   Like are you talking about like these like kind of spammy ads?
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.680]   Like what are some of the annoyances?
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:04.760]   >> And the loot boxes and that kind of thing, which I don't believe are allowed in arcade.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.680]   I don't think they're- >> No, no, they're not.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.280]   There's no in-app purchases at all.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.800]   Plus, they all can be played offline, which I think is really interesting.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   >> Yes.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:18.480]   >> And I think that that frees up developers to be making things that are fun, right?
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.120]   Instead of things that are like, how can we get them to spend more money?
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.840]   How can we lure them towards the loot box or lure them towards the extra armor that costs
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   $5.99 or whatever?
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:34.960]   So I think that could be good, but I just wonder how condition consumers are not to paper these
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.960]   gains.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.240]   And that's been the model is that you can download Candy Crush for free, right?
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.920]   Or it's a one time fee.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.200]   And I just wonder, but at $5, I think that's pretty cute.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.920]   >> That's why I think $5 is a good price.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.760]   >> It's $5 and it's for your whole family.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.760]   >> It's not just you.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.760]   >> Right.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.760]   >> And it's hundreds of games.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.760]   >> And it's hundreds of games.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   >> And you can't refresh them all the time.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:59.640]   >> There will you have Stadia on the other side, Leo, which is going to crush from the exact
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.880]   opposite vertical with always streaming any device.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   >> Well, we'll see.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.880]   >> A bunch of studio names.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.280]   Well, I mean theoretically you do it like you said to your point, Apple is giving a whole
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.080]   tab of the app store to our cave.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.720]   That is some of the most valuable software real estate in the world.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.440]   And Google is going to be promoting Stadia.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.720]   I don't know if it's going to promote it that much, but it probably will.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.600]   And you have these massive platforms sort of trying to reposition gaming both at the
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.600]   same time.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.600]   >> I don't know.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   This may just be me.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:29.320]   It was a little mad that Apple took away the tab that says update and put our guide there.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:33.800]   So now in order to update you have to tap on your head and you have to scroll up because
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.000]   it's below the fold and you can see all the stuff.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.400]   I think Apple though changed update behavior in the past.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.120]   You tell me if I'm wrong here.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:47.000]   In previous versions of iOS, even though I turned on auto update, it never seemed update.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.680]   I had to go in there every week and make sure everything got updated.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.320]   Now I notice everything is being auto updated.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.320]   And I'm wondering if that's what's happened.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.400]   >> It made two changes.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:02.240]   I think the batch processing is faster interval before they would wait maybe once a day and
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.720]   they would run it when the phone was sleeping and it wouldn't inconvenience you and it wouldn't
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   be wasting your bandwidth when you were roaming.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.000]   Now it seems to be more aggressive about it, but also they used to have a hard limit and
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.960]   what it would download over the networks because the networks are always petrified that a
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.920]   billion iPhone users are going to destroy their bandwidth.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.480]   Now you can go in and choose to tell it to warn you all the time, warn you over 200 megabytes
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.120]   or just never warn you anymore.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.480]   >> But I'm on Wi-Fi 16 hours of the day.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.880]   There's no reason why my iPhone shouldn't always be up to date.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.640]   And it very often wasn't.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.560]   Very often there'd be 30 or 40 apps that needed to be updated.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   That's not a day.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   >> It should be now.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.560]   No, it should be now.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.920]   >> So I haven't had to update manually since I got the new iPhone and I think they've changed
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   everything.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   That's actually good.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.200]   >> I don't mind if you take away the update tab is if I don't have to go there.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   That's good.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   Right?
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   It should be automatic.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.200]   >> Well, I also want to be able to manually update.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.680]   I don't want something coming up that I'm not aware of.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.120]   >> Oh, you want to go to the manual?
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.040]   >> I want to manually.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.040]   And I go through and I look at kind of what the updates are.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.240]   And in some cases I think, oh, I don't want that.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.600]   I'll delete the app before it can update.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:14.320]   So I'm kind of picky and I'm not usual, but I would rather not have auto updates.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   >> Interesting.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.920]   >> Well, you could turn that off, right?
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   >> Yeah, I do have a turn off.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   I do have a turn off.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.680]   >> I like, I don't mind that they took my tab away.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.920]   Although that is a bold move.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.680]   I mean, that really is you're right.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.040]   That's a big time free advertising.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   >> Well, that's awesome.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.880]   >> Some might think that's a little anti-competitive.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.600]   Apple's saying, look.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:41.800]   >> It's also that that's the way Android does it is in order to see your things, you
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.320]   have to go to kind of your account and then you see your apps and games in the play store.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.680]   So it kind of mimics the way it goes.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:54.080]   >> Although, to be fair, a long touch of the play store icon will pop up a menu that says
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.920]   your apps, you can go right there directly.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   >> Right.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   >> That's what I always do.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   All right.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.120]   Well, I know it's been too much Apple.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.200]   I know I'm sorry.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   One more thing.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.480]   >> Oh, you have that on iOS too, Leo.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.240]   The haptic touch, if you do the app store, it'll give you purchased updates, redeem, and
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.240]   search.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.240]   >> Oh, nice.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.240]   Oh, yes.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.240]   So it does.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.760]   >> I fixed haptic touch this year too.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.560]   >> I like the, I have to say, I don't miss 3D touch.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.560]   It's gone.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.360]   They've replaced it with haptic touch and a long press.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.240]   With one exception of moving icons around, which is still weird.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.960]   >> That is, well, now instead of having to try to negotiate between, did I long press
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   or did I depress?
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.720]   No, I went along.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.720]   >> Yeah, that was bad.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.000]   >> Because you're like, you know, now there's just a line item.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.640]   When you hold it down, it says a rearrange icons.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.520]   The two things that are still missing are the things that actually required real pressure
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.720]   sensitivity, which is the, when you could press deeper to switch between moving the
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.440]   cursor and text selection on the trackpad mode.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.600]   Yeah, that's gone.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.120]   And also anything that you use drawing, like notes, and you could do like press harder
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.280]   to get thicker or darker lines that's gone.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.280]   >> That's a bit of a loss.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.440]   Unless they bring pencil over to make up for it.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.240]   >> We all thought they would, but they didn't.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.720]   So what about the watch?
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.040]   Any thoughts on the new series five?
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.760]   You wrote the world's best watch.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.080]   >> Yeah, I think they're really nailed.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.080]   I think they were in the beginning, they weren't great at anything, but they sort of
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.880]   gave us a glimpse at what a wrist computer could be.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.240]   And then slowly but surely year after year, they knocked out like the second year, they
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.560]   made native applications.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.400]   The third year, they made LTE.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.000]   The fourth year, they gave it the redesign.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.160]   The fifth year, it's not all it.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.400]   And slowly but surely they've been removing impediments.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.000]   >> No, this one is like, this is the one that stopped it being a watch.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.920]   It just, it couldn't work as a watch before.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.040]   And now it's time with it all the time.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.040]   >> Yes.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.040]   >> Wow.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.040]   What a thought.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.200]   What a feature.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.680]   It's an actual watch.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.960]   >> And implementation is really clever.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.280]   Which is, the implementation is really clever.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.720]   Like a lot of previous watches would give you like a 1980s LCD display on top of your
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.440]   watch and it would switch between modes or you'd have to manually do it.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.880]   And this is just all your watch faces are just there and they just go slightly dimmer.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:04.880]   Nice.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.680]   I haven't got mine yet.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.280]   I'll get it next to this Friday.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   I can't wait.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.280]   Louise, what were you going to say?
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.280]   Do you wear an Apple watch?
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   No, yes.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   >> I don't know.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   This is a scrunchie.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   >> A scrunchie.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   Close enough.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.280]   You know what?
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.480]   Until recently, that told time as well as an Apple watch.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.480]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.280]   I'll get it back.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.480]   But no, but I do, I am kind of tempted for the first time.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:31.000]   I am somebody who's a little wary of another computer strapped to my wrist at all times.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Because I don't want to be moved to my phone any more than I already am.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.440]   But I think the price point now and there is like, I think some great features at this
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   point.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.480]   So I am kind of tempted to have the Apple watch.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.120]   But I feel like the biggest thing is if you're like an athlete, I think that seems to be
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.880]   still the biggest draw.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.280]   But one thing I'm still kind of hesitant about is the battery life.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.240]   You know, Apple advertises this as like, monitor your sleep, monitor your exercise,
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.240]   monitor your stress.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.240]   >> Never take it off.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.240]   >> It's going to die.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:06.840]   You can't actually monitor your sleep cycle and then go straight to monitoring your exercise
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.400]   and your stress at work or whatever, because you need to charge it.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.160]   So I think that's still kind of something an open question for me is the battery life.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.080]   And that's your normal watch.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.320]   You can just leave on all the time and kind of forget about it.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.360]   But the idea of having, you know, I love my AirPods, but the idea of having three Apple
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.720]   devices I need to constantly be worrying about the battery life on is just not super appealing.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.080]   Especially if you want to be using it kind of as a health monitor, which I think is something
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.800]   that Apple has pushed so much.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.560]   >> All right, Renee, what's the verdict battery life?
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.840]   >> So far I've got about the same battery life.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.720]   Russell Holly took him on one of his giant torture tests yesterday and he got slightly
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.840]   better battery life on the new one after biking.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:47.160]   I'm guessing 500 kilometers or something ridiculous like he usually does.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.520]   So it's been about the same.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.360]   What they did this year was their goal was to give you the always on feature without impacting
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   it.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.240]   And you're right, like mine goes about a day and a half.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.880]   It depends on how many workouts they do during a day.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.600]   And they did address the sleep thing.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:04.160]   Apple famously bought, bet it, but then hasn't integrated their own sleep tracking yet.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.000]   I'm guessing that might be next year's big feature and they'll address it.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.080]   But now it's sort of like, do your sleep tracking, get up, put your watch on the charger, go
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.000]   make coffee, go to a shower, whatever, then pick it up again and go to your yoga or go
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.680]   to work or do something like that.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.200]   Which is a lot of overhead to manage, especially without air power to sort of do everything
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.600]   at once for you.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:27.480]   But it's, my old watch lasted for three years, but if I had a fall on my bicycle, it wouldn't
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   call 911.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.160]   I couldn't make phone calls on it.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.160]   It didn't do it.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.280]   It didn't remote control the alarms in my house.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.280]   So I'm willing to make these trade offs, but I do hope that one day it's like every
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.080]   week instead of every day.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.200]   >> Renee, how long does it take to charge?
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.280]   >> To go from- >> That's a good question because I usually
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.840]   put it on overnight, but it is fairly quick.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.360]   It doesn't use Qi because Qi couldn't deliver.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.760]   It's a super set of the Qi standard because regular Qi wouldn't charge it fast enough.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:58.080]   So they're doing sort of like a fast charge off of a Qi-like charging system, but I'll
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.200]   run some tests for you.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.040]   >> It charges pretty fast, but not fast enough.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.200]   If you've been sleeping in it, just go to make coffee.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.600]   It's not going to charge all the way.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:13.560]   >> One of the few rumors that didn't come true is that we would have sleep tracking in
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   the Apple Watch.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.720]   >> Well, and there are already plenty of good sleep tracking.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.080]   You don't know like sleep cycle, for example.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.920]   You don't need to wear it on your wrist.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   >> Plus is good too.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:27.280]   >> I actually think sleep tracking is a really bad idea, partly because every morning my
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.240]   wife gets up and says, "I got 81 percent.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   What was yours?"
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.120]   >> He's me up at night worrying about it, Leo.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:37.240]   >> Yeah, that's what actually I read a study that said the people who are using sleep
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.280]   trackers sleep more poorly because they're obsessed with something.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.280]   >> What about it?
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:45.040]   >> I honestly- >> It's like quantum mechanics.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:51.880]   >> When I get a bad sleep preserve, I feel good today, but let me just see if I should.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:56.680]   My sleep score today was- Oh, it's not set up yet.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.680]   All right.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.680]   New phone who this?
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.480]   >> New phone who this, exactly.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.480]   >> Jeez.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.640]   >> I find sleep cycle works really good.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:09.000]   I have a bunch of notes of activities that happened in detail.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.560]   I actually have been using it for years.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.640]   I have a pretty good idea of what keeps me up and what doesn't keep me up.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.440]   I know I should stay away from tequila.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:23.200]   Come on, you knew that already.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   >> Yeah, I did.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   >> Really?
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.560]   You didn't have to tell you that?
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.600]   >> There's an app for that, Leo.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:35.040]   >> You might want to stay away from tequila.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.800]   >> So I'm just going to sign in and see if I should be tired today or not.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.880]   This is a bad idea.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.960]   Just don't track your sleep.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.840]   You know how you slept.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:47.080]   I also find that the compass is bigger deal than I thought it would be.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.080]   >> Look at you.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.080]   >> I think you're about 80%.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.080]   >> Honestly, that's compelling.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.080]   >> I hate you.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:54.840]   >> You're part of your purpose about the compass because I feel like I constantly need to reset
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.080]   my Google Maps orientation and I hate that.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.960]   >> I see people on this street doing this.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.960]   I know what's going on.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:06.040]   >> I liked it a lot because I took it for granted because my phone has had a compass for like
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.040]   a decade.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   So I didn't even think about it.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.440]   Then I realized all the, just the maps on the watch.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.360]   You see it, but you don't really know which way it's going.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   It tries.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.880]   But I just said I was out doing one of the battery tests and I lost track of my colleague
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.640]   Georgia and I just said find Georgia and it and defined my algorithm.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.400]   Did it saying point me to her.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   I started walking.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.760]   It said no, you're going the wrong way.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.000]   So I turned around and I walked the right way, turned the corner and she was there.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   >> I love it.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   >> I love compass.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   >> I'm into that.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   I'm into that.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   That's really seamless.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.720]   I feel like yeah, the dumbest thing I do on a regular basis is come out of the subway
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:42.800]   and hold my phone, look down, walk in a circle and try and figure out which way is the right
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   direction.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.560]   I do like the idea of having a watch that could do that in a much more elegant way,
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.320]   especially with the compass.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.320]   >> People who walk a lot.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.320]   >> Big cities are the worst.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   I always have the trouble in New York.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.960]   If you're walking, you just don't know.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.960]   Left or right.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.960]   I can't tell.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   It just takes too long to figure that out.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.960]   >> It's okay.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.320]   And then Wave will fix that for you, Lee.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:04.640]   >> Well, and Google Maps has already added this augmented reality feature where you hold
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.120]   it up and it sees this building and it has a big arrow that says, well, go that way.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.840]   So there are solutions out there.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.720]   I never thought I needed a compass.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.040]   >> There is a compass already on the phone.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.040]   Is the watch compass better somehow?
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.040]   >> It's independent.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.480]   Well, I mean, it's a novelty now.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.720]   The Starry Sky's app, you can hold up your watch and move it across the sky and it'll
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.040]   tell you what constellations you're looking at.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.400]   But I think it's really going to, when it starts to come together, I think this is all
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.040]   built around Apple's U1 chips and all these other things where you're going to be able
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.840]   to find things and find other devices and target other devices.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:41.440]   And for example, I lost my wallet when I was in New York and it was really stressful,
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.480]   but I had so many gadgets that it was fine.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:47.040]   But if I had just had that tag inside it and I could say, where's my wallet?
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.200]   And it would have shown me and I could just look at my watch and say, no, left idiot,
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   I would have gone left.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.600]   And that sort of thing I think is going to be transformative.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:58.120]   >> So this is a technology, this U1 chip called ultra wide band.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.120]   >> Yes.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:05.040]   >> It's kind of like Bluetooth range, 10 to 20 meters.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.880]   By the way, we were talking today on the radio show with Samable Submit is the car expert.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.120]   He said, you're also going to see these in automobiles.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.080]   >> That makes a lot of sense.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.960]   >> So it's spatially aware positioning radio.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.240]   >> Apple has not enabled it.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.240]   They have the chip.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.240]   They mentioned it on stage.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:28.240]   Well, it was in a graphic on stage behind Phil Schiller, but they didn't talk about it.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.320]   Did they brief you on it, Renee, with their intent?
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:35.440]   >> Yeah, but the use for now, I think that they just don't have their new tags ready.
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.840]   And that's why they knew someone was going to find it when they tore it down and say,
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.840]   what is this?
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.560]   I've had some kind of story for it.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:48.080]   And in iOS 13.1, which is coming out on the 24th now, it's going to enable airdrop.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.960]   So if the three of you are standing there and I want to make sure I beam something to Dwight
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.440]   and not Leo, I can point my phone at him and it'll prioritize him and say, oh, do you
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.440]   want to beam this to Dwight?
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.000]   And I just press the button and it'll do it.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.200]   That's like the first function they're doing.
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   >> Would all three of us have to be using an 11 series or will it work with all iPhones?
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.200]   >> Yes.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.000]   >> It identifies other U1 enabled devices.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.040]   >> Is there a U1 chip in the watch?
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.800]   >> Actually, that's a good question.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.160]   I don't think so yet.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:22.320]   I think it would probably suck off of the iPhones connection for now.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.080]   >> I'll say it'll be in the iPhone.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:28.040]   It'll probably be in the iPads in the next ones and it'll be in those little tags, which
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.040]   I really wish I had now.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.880]   >> All right, let's take a little break.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:40.880]   Louise Mizzakis is here from Wired, always great to have you on and you're scrunchie.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:45.160]   >> I just thought it was a really clunky watch.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.160]   I didn't know.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.160]   >> And you did.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.160]   >> Chunky watch, that's all.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.160]   >> It's a fit bit.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.160]   >> It's a new wristband, Leo.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.960]   You didn't see the new bands for this year?
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.800]   >> Dwight Silverman, the tech burger.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.840]   From the tech burger.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.440]   You just have to go to a huge, incredible icon slash tech burger.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.440]   That's the deal.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.840]   >> Yes, that's it.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.000]   I call myself the grill master, but nobody else does.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.080]   >> Are you telling me that techburger.com was taken?
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   >> Yes.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.880]   Yeah, I think it's a restaurant.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.680]   >> Oh, well, that's different.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.080]   >> But it's also part of the Chronicle.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:26.480]   I've got the newsletter I started, which is going, "Great Guns" has a different name
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.480]   also.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.480]   It's called "Release Notes."
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:36.280]   And that is, it's kind of very different from tech burger, but it's also part of the whole
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.280]   machine.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.280]   >> And that's free.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.480]   We can subscribe to that at Houston Chronicle.com/Release Notes.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.480]   >> Release notes.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.480]   Okay, cool.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.480]   It's great to have Dwight on.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:50.440]   And of course, Renee Richie, we know him from imore.com and vector his podcast on imore.com,
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.240]   but of course, a regular on Mac, "Break Weekly."
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:00.200]   He was at the Apple event and is one of the chosen few who got an iPhone early at the
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   event.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.000]   So actually three of them.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   You got all three models.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.400]   >> A lot of work comes with them, though.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.280]   I'm not saying I want it that way.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.640]   I'm impressed that they like you so much.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.640]   >> Oh, thank you.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   >> Yes.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.640]   >> I showed it, I brought to you by Capetera.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.480]   So many businesses are running software these days.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.840]   I was just looking at a graph that said like 40% of businesses are still running Windows
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.840]   XP.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.840]   And you know why?
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.320]   Because it's in a closet somewhere.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.320]   Hasn't been up.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.800]   You are running Windows XP.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   Stop it.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.800]   Because you know why?
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.440]   I bet you this is why.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.440]   Because you have to.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   Because that software that your business is built on, your line of business software won't
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:42.400]   run unless you have IE5 or Windows XP running.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.400]   That's crazy.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.600]   I want you to go to capetera.com.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:53.280]   Capetera.com is a directory of modern state of the art business software for every possible
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   business.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.680]   700 categories.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:01.240]   Everything from digital workplace software, video management software, SaaS solutions,
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:07.960]   CRM solutions, but also direct line of business software like mortuary management or yoga
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.480]   studio management.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.120]   There is software in there for everybody.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.960]   And what's great about Capetera, you pick the category.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.240]   You pick the software you are looking for.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   Narrow it down.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:22.160]   And I love it that these filters are, this is recycling software.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.160]   I love it.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.160]   The filters are actually tailored to the category.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:31.880]   So they will ask questions that are appropriate for that on-premises or in the cloud management,
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.040]   that kind of thing.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.040]   And then narrow it down.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   Then put a side-by-side comparison chart together up to four different apps.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.160]   You can see all the features.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.360]   Scrap, drag and extreme.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.480]   Now there is a program, man.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.680]   That's the one I need.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.680]   Creative star rating.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.800]   But here's the best part.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.800]   A million reviews on the site.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.000]   One thousand new reviews every day.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.400]   Vettied verified reviews from actual users.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.440]   That's what makes Capetera so special.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:03.760]   Before you pick software, you can see what real world people are experiencing with this
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.760]   software.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.280]   It's fantastic.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:10.040]   One million, 25,000 reviews now at capetera.com.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:13.120]   You'll be confident when you choose software there.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.480]   And I left out the best part.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.480]   I always like this.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.720]   It's free.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.720]   It's free.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.720]   Not freemium.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.760]   You don't have to buy donuts.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.760]   It's free.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:25.240]   In fact, I think the reason there's a thousand new reviews there every day is people are
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.600]   so grateful they go back, they pay it forward.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.000]   They say, well, at least I can do this.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.240]   I can leave a review.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.920]   You should do it too.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.840]   Millions of people use Capetera every month to find the right tools.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.840]   You should too.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:40.640]   C-A-P-T-E-D-E-R-A.com/twit.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:47.000]   Capetera's software selection.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   Simplified.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.560]   We thank Capetera for supporting our show.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:57.080]   We thank you for supporting our show by going to capetera.com/twit.
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.560]   Let's see.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.720]   Was there already a tear down?
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.440]   Oh, yeah, there was.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.320]   I fixed this tear down and they found a much bigger battery, by the way, which is not surprising.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.600]   That's one reason you're getting better battery life is something like a 15% increase in battery.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.600]   Right?
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.600]   Have it a million pounds?
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:21.280]   18% improvement in OLED efficiency and between 15 and 40% across the CPU efficiency, straight
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.440]   across the chipset efficiency.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.360]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.000]   Makes you wonder when I do this sooner.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   That's just great.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.920]   I'm thrilled.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.120]   Anything else we learned from the tear down?
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.720]   I always love what I fixed this.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.440]   There was some misinformation and they're like in the stories spread quickly where they
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:40.000]   said they thought they found the hidden reverse inductive charging, which as far as I had
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   a bunch of people seeing the after that point.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.920]   I know they did not happen.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.840]   Yeah, they're like, we don't have like it's, we never had that in there.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.520]   It was never a spec for release and there.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.760]   We don't know what we think they're looking at, but no.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   Sorry.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.560]   This is something that Samsung put in the Galaxy S10 and the Note 10.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.880]   It's a dopey feature, in my opinion, but since Samsung was selling wireless earbuds,
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.200]   you turn your phone over, turn on the inductive charging and you can use it as a charger
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.160]   for the headphones.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.800]   I can't imagine you can use that.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.200]   They're cheap for their watch as well.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.720]   So I believe it works for the AirPods and watch where Apple's not and I think they wouldn't
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.280]   ship it unless it could do both yet.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.840]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.480]   Yeah, it's not a feature anybody's going to say, oh, well, I definitely not get any iPhone
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   then.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   It's getting better.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.320]   I tried it in the earlier ones and it would take so much power from your phone to deliver
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.560]   so little power to anything else that it was just terabad.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.560]   All right.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:40.720]   I've been a great pleasure charging my iPhone on the Galaxy Note 10 review unit I have that
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.360]   just seems like great justice.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:46.240]   That's the Silicon Valley, that's the Silicon Valley air powered, right?
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.240]   That's right.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.920]   What were you going to say, Louise?
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:55.920]   I was just saying, you know, give I fix it a little slack here because I don't know if
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.360]   you guys know this, but the way that they do the tear down is that they actually go to
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.440]   Australia or wherever it's releasing first so they like fly around the world.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.200]   They're often racing other teams to be the first ones to get their hands on the iPhone
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.200]   first.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.960]   Yeah, the jet lag when they when they think they see something they didn't in their defense,
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.120]   but yeah, it's a really crazy race that they do every year and it's very impressive.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.240]   I love them for it.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.680]   I love them for it.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.080]   That should be on Apple TV.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.080]   We should mention that.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.680]   Wouldn't that be good to great amazing tear down race?
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.680]   Tear down.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.680]   Amazing tear down race.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.280]   I don't think that Apple really likes it that they do that.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   It is.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.160]   And that's somebody sign that up.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.600]   The amazing tear down race.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.360]   That would be so cool.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.880]   By the right, Jeremy Rig.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.160]   In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that Kyle Wiens and I fix it are sponsors
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.160]   of our shows.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160]   We love them.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.160]   Actually, we've given them the past.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.840]   We've given the affix it toolkits as gifts.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.400]   There's such great gift.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.800]   Pixel four long we did long as we gave iPhone all that time.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.480]   I guess we should mention Google's event is coming up now October 15th.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.560]   They are going to announce more than just the pixels though.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:17.600]   The interview the invitation says a few new things made by Google with the capital M
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.520]   and a capital G, which means we'll probably see other things.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:27.360]   One thing Google is rumored and again rumors as we learned with the iPhone are not proof.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.160]   But one of the things Google's rumored to be offering is a 90 Hertz display.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.160]   That's something the OnePlus 7 Pro has.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.040]   I really like it.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.520]   It's the rock phone too has 120 Hertz.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.520]   Remembering that correctly?
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.520]   But that's a gaming phone.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.800]   So they want that kind of refresh rate.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.680]   I still want it Leo.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.200]   So Apple did not do 90 Hertz.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.320]   That's probably something for next year.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.400]   Well, neither did Samsung and Apple get their displays from Samsung's fab, the same fab
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400]   location plant.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.160]   So I wonder where Google's getting theirs.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160]   That's interesting.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.580]   They were using LG but BOE, which I think just lifted Samsung's entire process and
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:07.440]   reimplemented it has been making a lot of inroads too.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.440]   Okay.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:14.040]   I think any camera review of the iPhone 11 would have to really to be fair wait and see
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.720]   what Google does with the Pixel four because you're comparing it with nearly a year old
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.720]   phone.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.080]   We'll see what Google's pixel four can accomplish.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:27.360]   Yeah, and a single lens, not very not right, not not to insult it, but it's not like a
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.360]   Huawei lens either.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.200]   No, they're going to have two lenses in the new one.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.680]   We don't know what sensors, but we'll find out in just.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.240]   We know there won't be a new pixel slate.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   That's sad.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.800]   Yeah, although rumors of a pixel book too, they resubmitted to the FCC.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:47.360]   So there will be a new, we think a new Chromebook from Google, a pixel book too.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.800]   The slate was a bad idea.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.720]   That was their tablet version.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.440]   And I should have been arm.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.320]   You think they'll always do the high end or are they going to do something less expensive?
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.600]   I think they might as well.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:04.200]   They're doing reference designs, you know, the idea of inexpensive developer phone.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.880]   That's what the Nexus line was.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.840]   I think that's, that's, although if you bought a Pixel three now or a three a now, they're
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.440]   really got the prices and awful lot.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.440]   Right.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.520]   But it is the rumor that Microsoft's on the code cheap.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.680]   Microsoft, my code cheap.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.320]   We're going to see it because Microsoft's event is October 2nd.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.840]   It's actually an exciting time of the year.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.480]   New surfaces.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.620]   The really thing that I'll be interested in is a dual screen surface, which we've been
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:37.160]   seeing some rumors for for some time going way back.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.160]   Microsoft fold.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.120]   Well, this is the Cintaurus, right?
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.120]   That's the code name.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.560]   And apparently they've shown it internally.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.920]   We've heard of them showing it around internally.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.520]   Unknown whether they'll announce it on October 2nd, but they will.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.920]   Windows core.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:59.560]   And I'm almost certain they will talk a little bit about arm for Windows arm for surface.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.560]   That will be interesting.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.200]   It feels like we're at a crossroads where a lot of things like we had the wind tell
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.920]   assumption for a very long time and that's starting changing and a laptop was a keyboard
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.480]   and a screen for a long time and that might be changing.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.280]   And phones and tablets were discreet devices and that's starting to change.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.900]   And it's I like it when it's fresh and new like when the iPhone came out and the POM
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:26.240]   pre came out and there was a Blackberry 10 and Windows phone.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.520]   There was just so many fresh and new ideas all the time.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.900]   They were sort of coagulated around iOS and Android and it feels like we're getting another
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:37.280]   moment in time where people are experimenting again and who knows who's going to be successful.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:41.680]   There'll be a lot of terrible products strewn across the floors of analyst reports.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:45.320]   But we might also get some really unexpected surprises along the way.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.480]   I really hope so.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:53.040]   I think what this iPhone cycle really showed is that I think consumers are not excited
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.840]   right now and I think that there's a lot of opportunity to capture the market right now
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.800]   because a lot of people are like, "Oh, they're holding on to their phones.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.480]   They're holding on to their tablets and holding on to their computers."
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.880]   And it will be interesting to see if someone kind of pushed through the noise and changed
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.040]   that.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.960]   This is the one thing the PC market really has an advantage.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:17.960]   There's so many manufacturers and they're all competing tooth and nail that the heterogeneity
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.400]   of the market was amazing.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:25.000]   I'm surprised there isn't a triangular PC out there somewhere.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.160]   It's on the office and that they have the trademark sadly.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.400]   They're just all kinds.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.680]   There is a Qualcomm chip that these new ARM Windows machines will be running on that is
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.920]   intended for desktop processing.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:43.000]   It won't be an 855 or anything we've seen before but it still remains to be seen.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.880]   One thing you know you'll get with an ARM processor and Windows is a lot of battery life
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.040]   like all day.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.560]   But whether the performance will be up to snuff is another matter.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.640]   The 8CX I think is that it?
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.240]   It wasn't there an AMD rumor for Microsoft as well.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:06.560]   There was a rumor that the Surface laptop would be there be an AMD version of it.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.040]   That's the one if you don't remember it's very nondescript kind of ultra book but it
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.320]   had but here's how you remember it had Alcantara.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.320]   Yes.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.360]   On the keyboard.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.040]   So many Reddit Cheetos pictures.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.760]   It was a terrible time.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.360]   It's so soft.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.120]   So soft.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:33.160]   I hope there will be an Alcantara free option because no Alcantara needs to die for my laptop.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.160]   That's for sure.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:43.160]   I'm saving them for the Tesla.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160]   Anybody here use Windows?
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.160]   Is that a curiosity?
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.160]   I do not.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.160]   I do not.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.160]   I do.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.160]   I do.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.160]   It works.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160]   You have to.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.160]   They make you.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.160]   I have to.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.480]   For the book about this I run Windows frequently on my Mac when I want to go back and forth between
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.320]   things and Windows 10 is pretty good.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:10.120]   It's a lot more complicated and a lot more moving parts than Mac OS but it is I don't
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.320]   think it long ago quit being Windows with a Z.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.160]   We will probably see a stripped down version of Windows also in a second.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160]   It's part of the Sintaurus.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.160]   Sintaurus.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.160]   It's a Windows OS right?
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.160]   It goes core.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.440]   So the idea is make the operating system modular which Linux is already but make the
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.760]   operating system modular and now have a very stripped down simple version that will run
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.200]   on slower processors.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.680]   That's interesting.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:43.880]   My friends and I only use it for VR so that part of my interest is to want them to make
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.120]   more hulking crazy gaming rig.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.120]   Oh, don't worry.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.120]   There will be plenty of those.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.080]   You're safe in that regard.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.560]   There's definitely a good view.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:58.940]   Well, you know, one of the original ideas behind Longhorn which ultimately became Windows
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:05.800]   Vista right was a modular operating system like that and of course the idea was ahead
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.440]   of its time and we saw what happened with Vista but they might finally be able to realize
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.720]   it with this.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.280]   Somebody in the chat was reminding me which I had conveniently forgotten that I had a
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.760]   HP ARM based HP laptop.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.760]   It's just awful.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   It's still have it.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   Right.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   Oh, so slow.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.760]   Oh my God.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.000]   Was it worse than the HP slate that had a button you could press to pop out the Intel
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.160]   inside sticker?
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.160]   What?
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.320]   Remember that they were so desperate to get that out.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320]   What's his name?
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.200]   Ballmer was on stage at CES before the iPad and they had this HP slate and you would press
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:48.760]   a button and this little plastic flange would pop out that had the Intel inside sticker.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:49.760]   And why?
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.120]   They did that because they had to have it but they didn't want to show it.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.240]   One of my colleagues, Derek Kessler wrote a blistering 15,000 word review on that device.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.400]   It's part of the Intel deal.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.200]   You get the co-marketing dollars and you have that sticker on there.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.200]   Right.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:06.320]   First thing I do on any Windows laptop is peel that sucker off.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.320]   Geez, Louise.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320]   Wow.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.320]   And I've put that one before.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.320]   I didn't mean to say.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.760]   I didn't mean to smirk you in any way.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760]   No, no, it's okay.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.760]   It's okay.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.000]   Maybe you need calm.com.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.640]   This is our sponsor for this segment of this week in tech.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.200]   Calm is a wonderful resource for anybody.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.480]   We were just talking about sleep.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.960]   I'm 63.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.480]   I finally got my sleep score 63%.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.480]   That's not good.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.920]   Most in fact, one in three US adults don't get enough sleep.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.280]   I'm one in three.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.040]   If you're not sleeping enough, you know it can affect your cognitive functions during
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.440]   the day like learning, problem solving, decision making.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.800]   Calm is more than just meditation.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.880]   It's a great sleep app too.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.600]   It helps you with getting to sleep and sleeping better with calm.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:03.680]   You'll discover a whole library of programs designed to help you sleep to get the sleep
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.560]   your brain and body needs.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.560]   Soundscapes?
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.560]   Wonderful.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.880]   I should play a few little soundscapes here.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.960]   So you can mask street noise and sirens and all sorts of things.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:25.120]   There's wonderful sleep stories narrated by soothing voices like Stephen Fry.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.240]   I love Stephen Fry's voice.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.440]   I just love him.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.280]   But also other famous people like Jerome Flynn.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.160]   He has a great story about New Zealand actually.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.760]   I learned a lot about New Zealand until I fell asleep.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.720]   It's one of the beauties of these.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.120]   They're wonderful stories for falling asleep that you don't really mind missing.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.120]   Hello.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.120]   Hello.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.120]   I'm Stephen Fry.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.760]   I am Stephen.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:57.800]   And tonight I'll be reading you a few lullabies.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.800]   Reading that singing.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.800]   Soothingly, boomerific poems.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:06.600]   Don't you love this with you?
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.920]   Love having Stephen Fry.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.920]   To help little children.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.080]   To put you to bed.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.240]   They have a lot of children's stories too.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.160]   It's really, I just love this idea.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.920]   There's music for meditation, for focus.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:25.400]   If you're a writer, I like having ambient music in the background as I work.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.600]   I don't want to hear lyrics.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.600]   I just want beautiful sounds behind me.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.480]   They've actually Moby released his new album exclusively on column.com.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:40.800]   There's master classes in sleep, but also conscious parenting, gratitude, peak performance,
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.800]   health, eating.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.480]   Do you see all this stuff?
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.480]   There's so much.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.520]   I have a column premium subscription.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.120]   Here's stretching classes.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.000]   Warm up, cool down, back care.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.560]   And of course, the lovely scenes.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.080]   Shall we visit the coastline at sunset?
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.560]   It's about sunset right now.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.120]   Somewhere in the world.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:06.480]   Ah, it's very beautiful.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.480]   Now let's bring back Stephen Fry.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.200]   Now let's go back to the sunset.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.200]   That's it.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.960]   There's no just for the sun.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   A summer meadow.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.680]   Anyone can be meditating.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.160]   See, you can mix them.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.680]   All right, I want you to sleep better.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.680]   I want you to relax.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.680]   I want you to meditate.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:27.600]   I want your life to be better and calm is the best way to do it.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.760]   Of course, there's the daily calm with Terrimo Levitt.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.400]   I just think they do a great job.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.480]   Right now we're going to give you 25% off a calm premium subscription.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.160]   Don't you feel calmer already?
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160]   I do.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160]   I do.

[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.560]   You know, 50 million people have downloaded Calm.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.560]   I'm one of them.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.560]   I've been a Calm Premium subscriber for years.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.280]   In fact, I know I have been for years because it's just renewed.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.280]   Calm.com/twit.

[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:02.720]   So according to the Financial Times, a team of researchers from Google have demonstrated
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.080]   quantum supremacy.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.040]   What the hell does that mean?
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.720]   The point at which a quantum...
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:17.080]   Wait, the point at which a quantum parameter is shown to be capable of performing a task
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.200]   that is beyond the reach of even the most powerful conventional supercomputer.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.680]   Oh, as Renee Ritchie calls it, "A supercomputer."
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.080]   No, did not tell.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.320]   We have a little bit of it.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.520]   Why does a French computer write on that too?
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.520]   No one knows.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.520]   I don't know.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.680]   I've written about quantum computing here.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:46.520]   There are a lot of companies, oil companies in Houston and certainly in West Texas who
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:52.200]   were interested in it for seismic and geological studies.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.600]   One of the things that they're all racing towards is this quantum supremacy where you
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:01.640]   can prove that a quantum computer can actually do something faster than a good supercomputer.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.800]   That's what they did.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.800]   Right.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:09.960]   Well, what happened is they posted apparently a white paper about what Google doing this
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.680]   was posted briefly and it was pulled down.
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.040]   Yes, and Google will...
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:17.120]   It was posted on a NASA website before it was taken.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.280]   And Google will not respond to a request for comment.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.960]   But that, to me, confirms that they did it.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.640]   Well, there are.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.320]   If they didn't do it, they say, "No, no, no, no, we didn't do it."
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.720]   How do you build the Star Trek computer without the computer Leo?
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.360]   So this is what the paper claimed.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:37.840]   They were able to do a calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds that would take today's
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:44.200]   fastest supercomputer, the summit, 10,000 years.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.960]   I think Google did it because they don't want anybody to know now.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.720]   They go, "Whoops," because that's terrifying.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.720]   Yeah, there's...
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.240]   I don't want my ads served off a quantum computer.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.600]   It's going to break crypto, right?
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:58.400]   There's still a lot of questions.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.000]   These quantum computers are really delicate.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.320]   We still haven't...
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:07.600]   They're not stabilized because the technology is so sensitive to any small changes in the
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.600]   environment.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.480]   There are a lot of questions still about what they actually accomplished here.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:18.040]   I saw a lot of researchers on Twitter being like, "It's not really clear exactly if quantum
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.480]   supremacy is really good reach here."
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.800]   I think everyone's holding cryptocurrency can relax for a minute.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.920]   Would it affect that?
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.760]   Oh, yeah, because suddenly if you have one of these, you could generate Bitcoin in a
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.760]   rapid clip.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:33.560]   Or break encryption to get to it.
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.440]   Or break encryption and get still...
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.440]   Right.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.600]   ...actually be probably better to steal Satoshi's Bitcoin than to make your own.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:41.600]   That's right.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.800]   And there are a lot of companies that are racing towards this.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.640]   IBM is in this game.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.520]   A lot of the Chinese are doing this.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.800]   And there's a lot of private companies in the US as well as Google.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:58.040]   So somebody's going to get there first and it may well have been Google.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.400]   Maybe the computer is Satoshi and it gets smart enough to go back in time and invent
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.560]   the crypto coin that it steals.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.840]   That would be cool.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.640]   All I wanted to do is figure out what the password is for my Bitcoin wallet.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.640]   Can it do that?
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:13.480]   You know what I wanted to get my email password back.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.280]   We lost $100,000.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.120]   Wired lost $100,000 because we lost the keys.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.120]   Oh, good.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.120]   I don't feel so bad.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.120]   I only lost...
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.720]   Well, it depends what the value of Bitcoin.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:25.840]   When it was at $20,000, I only...
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.840]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.840]   I lost $140,000.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.840]   Oh, my God.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.480]   That's the worst thing getting your Galaxy Note 9 pens done.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.480]   7 Bitcoin.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.120]   I have the wallet.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.120]   If anybody wants...
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.120]   Yeah, I have the wallet address.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.120]   But that's not...
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.120]   That's what we need.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.120]   That's not what I was saying.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.840]   I wish we didn't have the wallet address because then we wouldn't be able to see what we're...
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:50.640]   I bet you wired did the same thing I did, which was create this wallet, but not pay any
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.840]   attention because at the time, what's it worth and nickel?
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.840]   It's not.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:01.680]   What we did actually is we had mined some Bitcoin as an experiment when those consumer
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.680]   miner...
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:03.680]   You could do it.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.520]   So that we tested one of them.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:10.200]   We said, "Oh, it's not really ethical to be holding this, so we're just going to get
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.800]   rid of the key purposely."
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.800]   But at that point it was worth...
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   You threw away the key?
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.120]   But at that point, it was worth $12.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.120]   It wasn't a big deal.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.880]   And then it wasn't very clear what was going to happen because it was an ethical violation.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:22.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.400]   So if it's $12,000, you could have ethics.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.480]   But if it's $100,000, maybe my ethics are not.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:32.840]   No, but they could have had a really good holiday party.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.840]   What did it point in it?
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.640]   There could have been ways to deal with that.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.560]   We could have just paid the salary of a cryptocurrency reporter.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.480]   There are a lot of things we could have done.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.880]   But yeah, that is unfortunately what happened.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.400]   I have no ethical qualms.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.920]   If I can find the password, I'm unlocking this.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920]   I love it.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.080]   Quit holiday party.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.360]   So Steve Gibson, our security guy.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.360]   I've told this before.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.600]   Forgive me if you've heard it before.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:06.560]   The same thing, when this all first started, he said, "Well, let me set up a miner."
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:09.840]   And you could at the time, you could mine it with just plain old PC.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.640]   Next morning he wakes up, he's got 50 Bitcoin.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.560]   I was just...
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:22.600]   So he just kept it lying around at its peak that's worth more than a million dollars.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.280]   He erased the disk by accident.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.280]   Oh no.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.360]   I had it because I said, I kept asking him.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.280]   Come on guy, find it.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.400]   He said, "Is in that computer, it's in the corner."
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:39.680]   And then he finally admitted to me, "No, I erased the hard drive a long time ago."
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.920]   So test a new assembler code for the website and you need to the space.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.680]   I wonder how much Bitcoin is like lost is on the blockchain.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.680]   Oh, a lot.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:49.680]   In excess of...
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:50.680]   Oh, a ton.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.280]   There have been estimates actually, and it's like a fair amount.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:58.560]   A lot actually if you consider Satoshi's money too.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:03.040]   If you want to consider that lost, then it's actually a pretty significant amount.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:07.800]   And the problem with cryptocurrencies, unlike regular dollars, is that regular dollars get
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:10.160]   lost all the time and we just print more.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:15.000]   And that's kind of a problem with the currency actually, is that I think it's a fair portion,
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.080]   even if you don't consider Satoshi.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:22.760]   Here's a graphic from a Fortune magazine from a couple of years ago.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:25.440]   Total coins lost.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:32.480]   As many as 4 million Bitcoins are lost, a huge number out of circulation.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:38.000]   So it's really a small fraction of Bitcoins that are actually in circulation.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.080]   So getting back to this quantum supremacy, because this could be a big deal.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:49.280]   The MIT technology reviews talking about it, they had had its ironic the week before a
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.880]   conference in Cambridge, they were discussing quantum computing and Will Oliver is an MIT
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:22:00.920]   professor and specialist in quantum, said that supremacy, this milestone, would be kind
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.480]   of like the first flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:10.640]   It would be that important for a quantum machine to actually do solve a problem and to be able
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:17.760]   to demonstrate effectively that that problem was solved in many orders of magnitude faster
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.880]   than the best computer out there.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.720]   And I think that that counts.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:25.880]   If it would take 10,000 years for summit to do it in three minutes and 20 seconds for
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:29.400]   a quantum processor, that's a big difference.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.400]   Huge difference, yeah.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.280]   It's definitely a big turning point, but there's still just so many questions about
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.280]   this.
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.880]   We don't even know what problem is solved, right?
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.880]   Exactly.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.880]   I believe there's some new ones.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.120]   Yeah, we'll have to see.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.240]   This is like cold fusion.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.360]   It's one of those things that's always been just on the horizon.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.120]   Always coming, never arriving.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:57.720]   Any day now, there's a lot of stuff in technology like that, but that could be, you know, that
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.120]   could be a big story.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.120]   You just, you heard it here.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.800]   You could think back in the years to come.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.880]   I remember that show Twit, whatever happened to that.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:07.040]   Oh, yeah, that's where I heard the first time a quantum computer.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:11.400]   And then they turned it on and it unraveled the simulation.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.920]   We were all being run in and then we got to go over.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:14.920]   That's right.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.920]   I can't wait till that happens.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.920]   All the bits.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:18.920]   All the bits de-res.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:19.920]   I knew it.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.600]   That was the whole point.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.960]   They were running the simulator until we got to the quantum computer and we just screwed
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.960]   ourselves.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.200]   Elon was right all this time.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.680]   Elon wants to evacuate a planet.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.320]   He doesn't believe exists Leo.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:37.040]   I think in a way, don't you think that that kind of empowers Elon Musk that he thinks
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.360]   we're in a simulation because we'll screw it.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.360]   I'll just try.
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.360]   Let's see what happens.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.360]   I just could try this.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.760]   You know, I'll just drill a tunnel.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:44.760]   It's fine.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.760]   It's just a tunnel.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:46.760]   Let's see what happens.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.080]   That's certainly been his attitude.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.080]   Yes.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.080]   Well, you see the screw it in his eyes.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.640]   He's like, "He's the guy on Fortnite.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.880]   He's the guy on Fortnite who just wants to kill you."
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:57.720]   Doesn't really matter.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.240]   Do we have a promo for the week?
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.240]   You know what we might have?
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.240]   I think we might have...
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.360]   Do we have the episode zero for a...
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.360]   We don't.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.360]   We don't have that yet.
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.360]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.360]   And it shut...
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.120]   Should you zip next week?
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.560]   We did not achieve quantum supremacy no matter what you saw.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.720]   Next week we all achieve quantum supremacy.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:18.720]   Next week.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.960]   This week we did some cool things.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.640]   Let's take a look.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.360]   Previously on Twit.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.800]   Hands on tech.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.000]   I have a box cutter.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.680]   And I have a titanium blade.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.240]   iPhone 11 unboxing.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.120]   And Apple Watch Series 5.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.640]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:43.320]   Do you work from WeWork or know someone who does?
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.760]   WeWorks Week Wi-Fi security has been leaving sensitive data accessible and it's open
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:50.720]   network for years.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.520]   Security now.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:53.520]   Simjacker.com.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.520]   So where's the sim?
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.520]   Watch carefully.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.520]   Ha!
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.920]   It's a new sim card flaw.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:04.920]   This is discovered being actively exploited in the wild which allows attackers to hijack
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:14.680]   any capital all bold any phone just by sending it an SMS message which is like what?
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.960]   MacBreak Weekly.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.480]   But you got an iPhone at the event I guess.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.920]   We got a couple.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.720]   Oh my god a couple.
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.720]   Twit.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.880]   Technology isn't always pretty but we are.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.680]   It's lovey time.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:29.680]   I need a...
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:34.840]   Can you blow on me?
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.440]   I need more hair really.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.240]   To really do a good slow.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.520]   A good slow fee.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.280]   Apple apparently is trying to trademark slow fee.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280]   Did you see that?
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.920]   Yeah they are.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:48.560]   Book trying to trademark the word book in Europe.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.560]   Ha!
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.560]   Oh my.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.560]   That's book.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.560]   That's book.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.560]   The book.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:58.200]   Our show today, I just read an article that said, "Ask the rhetorical question, should
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.760]   you be using a VPN?" and the answer was yes.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.960]   Yes, you should be using a VPN.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.920]   A VPN, a virtual private network protects you when you're on open Wi-Fi hotspot.
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:12.200]   When you don't trust the source of your internet could be your internet service provider.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.880]   It could be that free airport wireless that I always see.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.960]   If you don't trust it, you shouldn't be using it without a virtual private network.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:25.840]   A VPN encrypts your data from your computer to the VPN server somewhere out there well
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.160]   away from any attack surface inside you, next to you or around you.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.600]   My favorite VPN, a lot of people ask me, "What do you use?"
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.600]   I use ExpressVPN.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.720]   I'll tell you why.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:38.720]   Few reasons.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:39.720]   First of all, it's easy.
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:43.080]   One button runs on every platform I use.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.960]   You just put the app on your phone or on your desktop, turn it on and you're encrypted.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.880]   It's running in the background.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:54.160]   Everything you do is now encrypted going out on the net and it's easy to turn off again
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.440]   when you want to do that.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.200]   It's really fast.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.280]   They have lots of servers all over the world.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.320]   That's good too because it means you can emerge into the public internet in any country
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.920]   you want practically anywhere around the world.
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.760]   But the other thing I really like about ExpressVPN is their privacy policy.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.440]   This is really the most important point to be made with any VPN.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.360]   You're just kicking the can down the road.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.360]   Yeah, okay.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:22.600]   That guy in the hoodie in the corner of the coffee shop can't hack you.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.880]   But as soon as you get to that VPN server, they can.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:27.880]   They can spy on you.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:30.440]   So you want a VPN that you can trust.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.760]   ExpressVPN you can trust.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:35.000]   They've been audited, third party audit.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.440]   They read their privacy policy, the audit said, yep, they do exactly that.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.720]   They even have added a new cutting edge server technology called trusted server.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.640]   They're actually running their VPN server in a sandbox.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.560]   So it cannot write to the hard drive at all.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.280]   There's not only do they not log, they couldn't log if they wanted to.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.400]   It's a whole new standard of privacy and security.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:59.480]   No trace of your visit is saved at any time.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:03.520]   Third party audit said, yep, that's exactly what trusted server does and it works.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.960]   Now, you may say, well, I've got a free VPN.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.760]   I can tell you right now, nobody runs a VPN server for free.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.680]   If they're not charging you, they're making money on you.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:17.600]   ExpressVPN does charge you, I think a very fair, great price for a really great service
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.400]   and a 30 day money back guarantee.

[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:29.800]   Don't ask me how you spell VPN.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.440]   I know you know.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.400]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.

[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:50.000]   Thank you express VPN for your support of show.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.840]   The most powerful person in the world meets Donald Trump.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:57.840]   There it is.
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:03.080]   This will be the Elvis Elvis and Nixon picture from years ahead.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.640]   There's Donald Trump with Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:10.600]   I can only, I just would love to be a fly on the wall there.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:16.480]   Talk about trains on different tracks.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.480]   Right?
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:21.960]   I mean, I don't think either one understood what the other was saying.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.120]   I'm sure they didn't.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:29.880]   It was just like, even more than like being in the room for the actual meeting, I would
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.320]   have loved to have been in the meeting with Trump.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:38.520]   Where they, I mean, Zuckerberg's team where they went over what he shouldn't say.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.480]   Like, they wouldn't be.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.480]   Do not look him in the eyes.
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.040]   You may never get out of that room.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.120]   Shake his hands, but make sure it's not for more than five seconds because he'll hold
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.120]   you.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.120]   He'll rip you.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.160]   Pick the Big Mac, not the chicken burger.
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.160]   Please.
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.160]   Yes.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.120]   The funny thing is, Zuck didn't mention it.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.520]   He didn't post it on Facebook.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.520]   It was, it was the secret.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.920]   The only reason we know this happened is of course the president tweeted it and Facebook
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:13.960]   did and Instagram that no, no, no details on what he was talking about.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:18.560]   Although I'm guessing Trump probably said, can you get me any information on this Biden
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:19.560]   guy?
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.560]   What do you know?
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.560]   What do you know?
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:28.440]   I mean, I think part of it, you know, Dorsey met with Trump during the summer.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:31.040]   You know, I think it's just don't regulate me.
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.040]   Don't regulate me.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.040]   I think that's not really.
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:38.800]   All of Silicon Valley has come one by one to talk to Donald Trump, including, you know,
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.000]   not only the social media guys, but the Google guys.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   Right.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.040]   Everybody has to come.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:50.920]   Satya Nadella, I'm sure, has talked to Trump because you need him, you need him to, to
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:52.880]   be plain ice.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:55.320]   And he's not real happy about social media right now.
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:58.280]   He thinks social media has an anti-conservative bias.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280]   Right.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.280]   Right.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:06.600]   I think the card to play honestly is if you regulate us, then you're going to be strengthening
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.600]   China.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.960]   I think that is the card to play with Trump.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:11.160]   But I bet that that's the card that Zuckerberg played.
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.160]   That's what they've been doing.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:18.400]   How did that work for Tim Cook when he went to president Trump and said, look, these tariffs
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.960]   are going to help Samsung, a South Korean, tell the next person spoke to him in five
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:23.960]   minutes later.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:25.960]   Right.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:26.960]   Right.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.560]   Now, what is, by the way, the tariffs on or off?
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.560]   They're not on the ice.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:30.800]   They got an exemption, didn't they?
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:31.800]   Right.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.800]   Right.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.800]   But not for certain things.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:34.800]   The iPhone got pushed back.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.800]   Right.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:37.800]   Yeah, for the time being.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:38.800]   But it's so, and that's the problem exactly.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:44.640]   Like you said, is the uncertainty, I think, is what is the issue for all these manufacturers
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:48.920]   that they just don't know whether the tariffs are going to impact them or not?
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:55.520]   But yeah, no, that picture of Zuckerberg and Trump is going to haunt my dreams.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.520]   Here's another one.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:01.360]   So just so you know who this is, but this looks like the signing of the Declaration
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.360]   of Independence.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.480]   It's a beautiful, beautiful picture.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:09.920]   That's Dan Scavino, who is the White House, or no, this is social media director.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:15.640]   This is according to Gizmodo, an unknown man.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.880]   Come on, Gizmodo, you got to up your kugafoo.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.400]   That I believe is the presidential son and lingerie Kushner.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.400]   There's Mark.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.400]   Yep.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:31.200]   And Joel Kaplan, who I think is chief counsel at Facebook.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.200]   And then...
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:37.440]   What's interesting about this meeting is that for as much as the administration and Congress
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:44.080]   and the Senate is mad at big tech right now and they're circling them like hawks to regulate,
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:48.480]   Trump and Dan Scavino spend a ton of money on Facebook ads.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.480]   Oh, yes.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.480]   Absolutely.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.480]   Millions.
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:56.400]   So it's interesting to have Scavino there because he's probably like, what kind of strategy
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.600]   should we be doing with our ads to win the next election?
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:02.800]   I think it's hysterical that Jared is there.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.480]   And I think he's pulled in because the president said, "Who's young?
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.480]   Who can we get here?
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.480]   Who's young?
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:10.480]   Anybody under 30 around?"
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.480]   Right.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.480]   Who's on Facebook?
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.480]   Who's on Facebook?
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.880]   Any of you use the Facebook?
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:21.680]   Mark does not look happy, but everybody who gets pictures taken with the president.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.680]   Jim Cook looked also a little grim.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:25.680]   Yes.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:27.960]   It's also very white in that room.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:28.960]   Right.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:29.960]   And male.
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:30.960]   Not talking the pink.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:31.960]   White and male.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:34.960]   It's not surprising.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:40.320]   Our idea would cause our heads to explode.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.680]   Well, I think it's kind of part of the deal.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:44.680]   You got to go.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:47.440]   You got to make nice.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.160]   Facebook is doing what it can, I think.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.920]   And I think, look, I'm not a fan of Facebook.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:53.640]   I quit them a year ago.
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.640]   I don't miss them.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.000]   I understand that many people, it's the only way they stay in touch with family and friends
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.360]   so they don't feel like they have the choice.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.360]   I understand that.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:04.480]   But boy, I don't miss it one bit.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.840]   But I think they also understand that there's going to be a lot of scrutiny.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.240]   They don't want to get broken up.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:15.600]   They don't want to be told, as one Congress member told them, to sell Instagram or WhatsApp.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.600]   Right.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:23.080]   So they're doing what they can do, at least appear to be trying to get some control over
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.040]   Facebook before the next election.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.160]   They have created an oversight board.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.660]   Great.
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:31.920]   This is an interesting independent board.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:36.920]   Although there will be some Facebook people on it, but a great many not.
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:45.600]   And the idea of the board is Facebook will present to them when there's an issue and
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.160]   the board's decision will be final.
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.160]   They will.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:53.880]   Yeah, I don't think it's a bad idea, honestly, to have some outside people to be helping in
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:56.520]   kind of these tricky content moderation situations.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:59.720]   But I think with this oversight board, it is interesting.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:04.440]   I just don't know how often it will really come into play.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:07.880]   Think about how many cases of some Supreme Court take.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:12.800]   Really not that many compared to how many important cases there are across the country
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:13.800]   every year.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.480]   So I just don't know how often this will really come into play.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.040]   How often is it really ambiguous?
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:24.440]   I guess it will be interesting in the Alex Jones in the world when someone like that appeals
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.880]   and it goes to the oversight board.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:30.480]   It'll be really interesting to see how often people appeal and how often there really is
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.480]   disagreement.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.920]   It kind of is like the Supreme Court, isn't it?
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920]   It's exactly.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:41.080]   I have a feeling there will be a lot of them going because everybody believes in their own
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:46.160]   sanctity and everybody believes that they deserve to be left alone and say what they
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.760]   want to say on Facebook.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:53.000]   I haven't seen exactly how it proceeds up through the ranks and at what point it can
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.320]   stop and not be allowed to continue.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.840]   But if everybody keeps pushing it, this could have a hard time scaling.
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.040]   Here's the flow chart from the Facebook post.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.960]   There's two ways a case can get to the board.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:09.120]   One Facebook identifies a case for referral like the Alex Jones case where they would
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.840]   just love to pass the bucket say you decide.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.560]   The other though is users can submit request for board review.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:21.400]   In both cases, Facebook will assess those referrals against, I'm just reading here, so
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:24.000]   don't blame the messenger.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.760]   The authorization guidelines and submit for board review, I don't know what prior
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:33.160]   taste is prior, I don't know what that even means.
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:37.920]   And then the board will have a case selection committee which will have five members they'll
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.400]   rotate.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:44.480]   That committee will then select the cases and assign them to panels because the actual
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.880]   review is 40 people.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.480]   It's pretty big.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.000]   So they can divide it up into groups.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.440]   They'll submit it to a panel.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:58.080]   So ultimately Facebook is deciding who gets to talk to this.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.080]   That's right.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.880]   Facebook is the gatekeeper on what gets to the panel.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:05.200]   Well then, what's the point?
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:10.360]   Well you realize that even if there's 40 people, this does not scale well.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.520]   No.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:16.400]   It's going to be of the avalanche of requests, only a trickle will get through.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.560]   Oh, they're just going to use the Facebook coin board.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.960]   They're not using them for anything else right now.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:21.960]   Right.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:22.960]   Right.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:23.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:29.480]   So Facebook will select a small group of initial members who will then help with the
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:31.520]   selection of additional members.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.960]   There'll be a transparency report.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:39.040]   I think Facebook is going to be at pains to make sure this looks like it's a fair process,
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:40.280]   an equitable process.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.560]   Because they're a sale on both sides.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.840]   They're a sale by conservatives who say you shut down conservative voices and they're
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:54.000]   a sale by members of Congress who say you're too big, often from the left, you're too big.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.560]   So they're getting it from both directions.
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:03.040]   So they're going to be at great pains to make it look as if it's a kind of a fair process.
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.520]   Just get Wil Wheaton.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.920]   And if he says that you're being a jerk, you're being a jerk and they shut you down.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.000]   That's all you need.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.160]   I would trust Will.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.160]   Let Will do it.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.200]   Just don't violate Wheaton's law and you're fine otherwise.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.200]   You're all.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.840]   That's a great idea.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.040]   I think we can all agree.
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:19.840]   Wil Wheaton should be in charge.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.040]   Except for Patrick Stewart.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.040]   Yes.
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.320]   I heard that kid.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.320]   Choss up, Will.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.840]   And then crush that makes me nuts.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:29.840]   All right.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.400]   Well, anyway, the board has been announced.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:33.560]   These are the final rules.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:34.800]   The board has not been announced.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.200]   These are the rules for the board that we'll hear later.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.640]   I'm curious about what some of the members will be.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:41.360]   That's not a lot of people.
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.360]   Oprah.
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.160]   It's going to be somebody like that.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.360]   It's going to be community organizers.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:48.360]   It's got to be somebody.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.400]   It's going to be somebody from the left, somebody from the right.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:56.560]   It'll be interesting to see who would end up.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.840]   Meanwhile, Facebook's decided to double down on the camera in your house.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:08.080]   They are releasing a new range of portal smart displays and video chat peripherals, including
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.440]   the portal TV.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:14.200]   A camera bar you put on top of your TV set.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:17.640]   Because after all, doesn't your TV deserve to know what you're up to?
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:24.920]   They're watching you Netflix and chill.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.920]   There was a great moment.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.640]   Do you watch the TV show Succession?
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:29.040]   I love this show.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.960]   I keep talking about HBO show about a media mogul, kind of a Rupert Murdoch type, and
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:41.560]   his five horrifically horrible children, each of whom are vying to take over the company,
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:44.880]   each of whom is worse than the next one.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.920]   One of the son-in-laws is in charge of their news network, which is a kind of a Fox news
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:50.080]   like.
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.960]   But he's just speaking at a conference like an Alan and co-conference up in the skis,
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:56.960]   shall I?
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.880]   They've done a lot of focus group testing for this news network, and they've decided
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:06.280]   that their slogan should be, "ATN, we hear you."
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:09.160]   And then cousin Greg comes running up right before the thing.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.240]   He says, "We can't say that."
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:12.240]   Why can't we say that?
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.280]   Well, it turns out we actually do hear them.
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.840]   We've got a microphone in the device.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:19.840]   Well can we say we're listening?
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.040]   No, it's the same thing.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.040]   We are listening.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:31.560]   So they end up coming up with a slogan, "We hear for you," which makes the front so.
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:32.560]   But that came out.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.920]   That show was right before Facebook announced this.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.640]   Facebook, "We hear you," is the new slogan clearly.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.640]   I don't know.
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.160]   I bought the portal but immediately realized what a horrific mistake I had.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:50.520]   I say this as somebody who knows people on these teams, and I'm proud of the work that
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:54.200]   they do in terms of just engineering products.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.840]   But I think at this point you've got to be out of your mind to put one of those things
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:57.840]   in your house.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.920]   Yeah, but this has been scandal at this kind of.
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.640]   And by the way, I too know people on this team and across Silicon Valley, we're often
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.800]   very critical of what these big companies are doing.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.480]   The individuals are nice people.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.080]   They just want to make a great product.
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:14.440]   They're like, "Oh, this is a great problem.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.240]   We're going to put four microphones in it.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.040]   We're going to have touch displays.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.760]   We're going to have a camera that can follow you around.
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:20.920]   It's incredible.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:25.000]   We'll scan you if you're new so that we'll know never to broadcast you when you're new.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000]   That'll solve the problem."
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000]   Yeah, this is that awesome.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000]   And the name wouldn't end up.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.240]   We'll send those pictures back for analysis just to make sure we're not making any mistakes.
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:36.560]   And we'll have humans check them all and it'll be fine because they'll know what's a mistake
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:37.560]   and it's just your turtle.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:38.560]   And Jimmy, we don't want to take your turtle.
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:39.560]   Every year, that's how they think.
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.680]   I know it's fine.
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:42.680]   But what they do.
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:49.480]   At a more practical level, I also just don't know if it's really that bad to be face timing.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.600]   I just don't know if I want a thing sitting on my countertop.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:42:01.080]   All these companies are buying for who is going to want their next to their portal,
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.240]   next to their Google home.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:05.280]   I got them all, baby.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:10.160]   I just got the next Hub Max, which by the way, I don't know why I'm giving Facebook a hard
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:12.480]   time because this thing does exactly the same thing.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.960]   It's a really nice picture frame.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.320]   It's a camera.
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.520]   And then when I get in front of it, it goes boom, hi Leo.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:19.520]   It knows I'm there.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:22.320]   It says, here's your schedule for today.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.400]   Here's some stories you might be interested in.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.520]   And the quantum version will know when you will be there.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.520]   And I don't know.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:32.160]   Maybe it's because I have this inherent trust of Google.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:33.160]   I don't know.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.160]   I like the pictures.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:40.480]   It's interesting, though, how much your trust of the company factors into whether you like
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.480]   the device.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:44.160]   And that's something that maybe these engineers can't really account for.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.800]   That's a public relations job.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:51.960]   The thing that makes me mad about the whole Facebook portal thing is that they co-opted
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:54.920]   the Muppets to promote it.
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.920]   That's sacrilege.
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:59.160]   Jim Henson would never have allowed.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:03.160]   Oh, actually he did a lot of ads for corporate stuff.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.160]   Let's start that.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.440]   Yeah, I just don't see.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:12.880]   You have to think this is the ultimate in tone deaf marketing because looking at what
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:17.600]   Facebook has been through, and then they had another one of these things this week where
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.760]   they had to delete all these accounts.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.600]   I mean, all these apps that were leaking data.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:27.000]   It happens again and again and again and again.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.640]   They said because of Cambridge, because of Cambridge Analytica, where he's leading these
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:33.080]   apps, that was three freaking years ago, dude.
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:34.080]   That's right.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.400]   Why are they still there?
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:36.400]   What?
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:41.040]   So the thing is here you are, you're putting out a product that watches you while you
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:44.600]   watch television and you're saying, "Trust us.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.040]   This is a great product.
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.760]   This will make your life better."
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.560]   No, it's not something I can trust.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:58.840]   Two studies just released researchers at Princeton University of Chicago looked at the Roku
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.640]   and Amazon set top boxes.
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:03.640]   And guess what?
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   We here for you.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:15.480]   69 Roku channels, 89 percent of Roku channels, 89 percent of Amazon Fire TV channels are
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:21.640]   actually monitoring, they've got microphones on them, monitoring what you're watching.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:26.720]   A second study, researchers at Northeastern and in Imperial College of London examined
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:30.740]   an even broader range of cloud connected consumer devices.
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:36.760]   The TVs were the worst for how many, quote, "unique third party destinations," quote,
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:43.540]   they contact Facebook, Amazon, double click among the top recipients of consumer data
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:44.840]   from these devices.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:49.320]   They're sending data about what you're watching, what you're doing back to these places.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:54.040]   Akamai and Microsoft both get a lot of hits, but that's because they're the cloud source
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.120]   for all of this stuff.
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:00.040]   Nearly all this is the punchline.
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:07.940]   Nearly all TV devices in our test beds, contact Netflix, even though we never configured any
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:10.420]   of them with a Netflix account.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:13.340]   You don't have to have a Netflix account.
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:16.220]   They just the Netflix software being on the device.
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:17.220]   Interesting.
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:21.500]   So they're probably trying to figure out what you're doing on the other streaming.
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.220]   Yeah, what are you watching?
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:25.020]   What do we have to, what do we have to be?
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:29.980]   So they're spying on the people who are spying on you is basically what's going on.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:32.180]   Their recommendations are still terrible, go figure.
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:35.480]   Yeah, you think they'd be better at that.
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:41.260]   So if you have one of these devices, I'm honestly, I think the end result of a lot of
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:44.680]   these articles and the stories we're telling about this stuff are just people just give
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.680]   up.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.280]   They go, "What am I going to do?"
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.480]   Yeah, it's a lot of privacy fatigue.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:53.760]   There is no way that you can take that Roku and keep it from doing that.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:57.880]   I guess if you were sophisticated enough, you could be running a firewall that would block
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:00.040]   it, block outbound traffic.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:02.080]   That's probably the way to do it.
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.960]   That was also part of Apple's recent pitch they put on every one of those subscription
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:05.960]   services.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:06.960]   We don't track you.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:07.960]   We don't share information.
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:08.960]   We don't give it to everybody.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:09.960]   So you can mark it against it too.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.640]   Hey, Karsten, what are you doing here?
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:14.360]   Did you storm area 51 yesterday?
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:20.240]   No, my boss wouldn't pay for the RV.
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:29.600]   Do you have to take down some of the iconic signs on the road leading there?
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:32.800]   There's a bunch of fun signs that they had to take down because they were afraid people
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:33.800]   would steal them.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:38.640]   Apparently, not that many people showed up, just a lot of weirdos in a costume, right?
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.400]   Yeah, it was a meme.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.880]   I think that the people in the area took it a little too literally.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:49.720]   I think most people knew that you weren't really supposed to go there.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:50.720]   Right.
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.880]   There wasn't fair that there would be a massive invasion.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:56.360]   Like thousands of people would go.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:59.640]   But I think that kind of like the air forces.
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.640]   Yeah, right.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:04.120]   In fact, they declared a state of emergency.
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:05.120]   Did they really?
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.120]   You're by little villages.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:11.720]   The scene at story at one point, a man in the mask stepped toward the barricaded gate
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:16.080]   marked with a stop sign and assumed the pose of a Naruto runner.
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.800]   That's from anime.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:21.160]   An armed guard looked on as the crowd shouted, "Don't do it."
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.320]   And then, no, he didn't do it.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:25.320]   He just turned around.
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:27.560]   The sign says extra-trestoral highway.
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.120]   And that's what the sign reads.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.480]   And now that they have to take that down.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:35.040]   Is there a word people would steal them?
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.520]   All right.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:40.520]   So it didn't play out.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:43.760]   With the storming now complete.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.760]   Right, seen it.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:49.160]   Thousands more people are expected to attend a pair of alien themed music festivals in
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:52.280]   the tiny desert towns of Rachel and Hiko near Area 51.
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:54.680]   So I guess that's going on right now.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:59.760]   The Hiko site includes a mock Area 51 gate for visitors to safely storm for all your
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:01.760]   selfie-taking needs.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.760]   It's slow.
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:05.560]   Oh my god.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.600]   Here's pictures.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:11.320]   There are people dressed as aliens.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:18.120]   People with tin foil, selling tin foil, for which you can make hats.
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:21.240]   People with alien dealie bobbers.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:24.360]   Ah, cone heads.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:25.360]   Cone heads.
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:32.760]   So, you know, it kind of, it didn't really, it didn't really look like a alien stock.
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:36.440]   No, this is a locals put up signs and said, "Go home.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.440]   No alien stock."
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:39.440]   Sorry.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:42.960]   I'm sorry, we've been a bomb.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:47.400]   Bracing for a crowd of unknown size, unknown was like 12 it looked like they weren't.
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:49.160]   Here's a guy grilling chicken.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.160]   This really nothing.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:51.160]   Was it alien chicken?
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.400]   It was not actually wood stock.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:58.680]   And it came from Texas.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:04.960]   I had the weekend free, so I figured why the heck not.
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.560]   This is not even burning man.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.560]   This is like nothing.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:10.240]   This is not nothing.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:13.880]   Where are the aliens, Leo?
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.320]   We are the aliens.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:16.920]   It may be.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:17.920]   We may be.
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:18.920]   All right.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:23.160]   One more quick mention and then we will wrap it up.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.160]   What a great panel.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:29.520]   I'm so glad to have you from the Houston Chronicle tech burger, our good friend, old friend, Dwight
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:36.120]   Silverman, who's been a regular on our shows for many, many moons from Wired.com.
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:39.200]   It's always wonderful to have Louise Mazzakis on.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:40.200]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.720]   Louise, the sun has gone down in Brooklyn.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:44.560]   It has now dark in here.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:51.080]   I had to actually have my partner come turn on the lights and not going to lie.
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:52.080]   That's okay.
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:53.640]   We like it doing it in the dark.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:54.640]   It's always fun.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.280]   Actually, Dwight seems to be like in a kind of a...
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.080]   Yeah, we're doing a studio with my own there.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:00.080]   I love that.
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.080]   This is our podcast studio.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.320]   This is the same place.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.320]   They used to have a green screen behind me, Leo.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:11.760]   Now they've got, as you can see, they've got soundproofing and so forth.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.600]   So no more green screen, but same place.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.600]   I kind of like this better, really.
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:20.840]   Renee Richie in his home and beautiful Montreal where he's probably right after the show going
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:25.920]   to make another vector podcast because the guy just can't stop.
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:26.840]   Our show today brought you.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:29.280]   I love, I put Mint Mobile.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.280]   Man, I just can't believe how good this is.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.120]   Mint Mobile is an MVNO, a mobile virtual network operator for T-Mobile.
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:39.640]   So if you have T-Mobile service in your area, everybody does.
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:44.240]   You are paying too much if you're not using Mint Mobile.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:49.720]   Network coverage is so good these days, no matter who your wireless provider is, you're
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.280]   going to get great service.
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:56.560]   Why pay more for the same service when you can get Mint Mobile?
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.560]   I pay.
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:58.560]   Let me tell you what I pay.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:50:59.560]   And here's the deal.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.400]   They're online only, they don't have stores.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.800]   And I pay a year ahead of time.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:11.440]   So for unlimited text, unlimited phone service on the T-Mobile network, 12 gigabytes of data
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:17.120]   a month, which is more than I ever need, I pay $25 a month.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:19.560]   I paid $300 for the year.
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:22.360]   That's it, $25 a month.
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:27.160]   You can get even less if you don't use much data as little as $15 a month for the same
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.360]   high end coverage.
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:34.360]   Go to the Mint Mobile site, mintmobile.com/twit, and do the calculator, see how much you save.
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:37.800]   It is truly remarkable.
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:42.800]   Your old wireless bill is paying for expensive retail stores for overhead.
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:45.640]   Mintmobile.com/twit, you got to check it out.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:47.400]   Cut your wireless bill down.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:51.880]   You get unlimited nationwide talking text, crazy fast 4G LTE.
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:53.720]   Bring your phone, keep your phone number.
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:54.720]   That's fine.
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:56.120]   You can port your phone number.
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:58.120]   All your contacts go with you.
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:03.320]   And if you're not 100% satisfied, they've got you covered a seven day money back guarantee.
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:06.600]   They have iPhones, they have Galaxy phones.
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:09.840]   Just go to the Mint Mobile website, check to make sure your phone will work with Mint Mobile.
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:11.800]   If it works with T-Mobile, it will.
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:12.800]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:18.840]   In fact, right now, $15 a month with their three month introductory plan and get the
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:20.200]   plan shipped to your door for free.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.080]   Go to mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:24.680]   I love the Fox.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:30.400]   Honestly, I spend so much on cell phone service because I have all the carriers.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:32.360]   I'm just going to move them all to Mint Mobile.
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.600]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:38.440]   I knew you guys would want to know about this.
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:47.400]   So I was very happy to say, yes, we want to tell the world about Mint Mobile.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:51.400]   This is a sad story in so many ways.
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:56.520]   But I should mention that Richard Stallman, RMS, who is the leader of the free software
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.760]   movement, he wrote E-Max.
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:05.160]   He was one of the hackers Stephen Levy wrote about in the hackers book, had some odd beliefs
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:13.800]   about pedophilia and is now basically gone from MIT where he's a visiting professor
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:16.360]   at the computer science and AI lab.
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:21.640]   He's resigned his position at the Free Software Foundation.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:25.080]   There's a lot of people saying it's about time.
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:28.360]   I'm sure that's the case.
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:35.840]   He's certainly minimized the harms from sexual assault and sex with children.
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:41.920]   He was so strange that I never, I didn't really know about it, but it didn't surprise
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:42.920]   me.
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:47.440]   Yeah, a lot of people were coming out, a lot of people that I know were coming out and
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:52.000]   saying, you know, part of the reason that I, not myself, but a lot of people I knew were
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.680]   saying that part of the reason that they didn't participate in the free software movement or
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:57.480]   they didn't feel as included was him.
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:54:02.280]   Yeah, because of his behavior and because of how they treated him, especially women.
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:03.280]   That's okay.
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.880]   That's interesting.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:11.680]   So this is what I want to hear because the two things I saw were posts, one from many,
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:20.720]   many years ago, which he later disavowed in saying that pedophilia was not bad if it
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:24.000]   was a willing participant, if the child was a willing participant.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.680]   He then posted later, I've been told by a lot of, I've been schooled and I was wrong.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:32.240]   There's harm involved and of course it's wrong.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:37.480]   And then later when the Jeffrey Epstein thing came up, he once again kind of stumbled into
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.440]   it by saying, well, a 17 year old, what's the age of consent?
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.960]   It's probably okay.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:43.960]   But this is the deeper story.
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:47.120]   And I want to hear what you have to say about this, Louise, because I don't know about this.
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:51.680]   A number of people are now starting to come forward saying, yeah, he really wasn't very
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.680]   cool towards women.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.680]   Is that what you're hearing?
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:58.960]   And I think that those beliefs were maybe indicative of like an overall attitude.
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:03.600]   And I've seen a lot of kind of talk about like, what does this really mean for kind of the
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:06.600]   free software movement and for open source?
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.040]   Because I think that there were this whole movement about how it being open about anyone
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:14.680]   being able to use it about it being like this kind of utopian vision for what the future
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:15.680]   of technology would be.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.560]   And I think this is one example of how it's not really open, right?
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:20.560]   Like there are gatekeepers.
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.840]   There are gatekeepers like him who actually stop a lot of women and other groups from
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:27.960]   participating in technology.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.960]   And I think that's kind of what it was about.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:32.000]   And it wasn't just about his beliefs on pedophilia.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.720]   It wasn't like kind of strange beliefs.
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:38.480]   I think those beliefs manifested in the way that he treated people.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.600]   And then people started coming forward a little bit.
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:46.560]   Dana Boyd, when she received a EFF award, talked about being an MIT and talked about
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:49.640]   the really hot kind of difficult climate she transcended.
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:53.160]   She was able to continue, but it wasn't a very positive climate.
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:55.400]   She was very angry about it.
[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:57.760]   There was this tweet from star Simpson's.
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:03.160]   She said, I remember being walked around the MIT campus by an upperclassman during my freshman
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:05.120]   year.
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.400]   The upperclassman pointed out, look at all the plants in her office referring to a professor.
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:15.240]   All the female sea sail professors keep massive amounts of foliage in their office because
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:17.720]   Stalman hates plants.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:24.000]   He won't come into their office because of it.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.680]   That's a hostile environment.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:30.880]   If you've got plants in your office to keep somebody out of it, that's not good.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:33.600]   So I don't know, hostile culture that just allows it to perpetuate.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:36.120]   I think that's the biggest story, isn't it?
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.760]   We need women in computer science.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:40.160]   We need women at MIT.
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:47.000]   We need women at the Media Lab just to make sure that diversity, not just women, but
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000]   diversity, people of color too, just to make sure that that software does not build in
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.480]   the biases of white men.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.480]   I think it's also--
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.480]   It was an interesting--
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.480]   Go ahead, Louise.
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:02.240]   I just think that there's this excuse of, oh, the weird eccentric genius.
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:03.880]   And this is a really good example of that.
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:07.600]   Oh, you can-- because you're so brilliant.
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:10.400]   And that was definitely-- I think what was our play here is that, oh, we're just going
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:15.680]   to ignore his weird hatred of plants and his weird preferences because it's worth it.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:19.880]   And is it really worth it if people are getting treated so horribly?
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:23.560]   It makes me sad because now I understand.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:24.800]   That's terrible.
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:29.000]   But he was an important figure in the computer science.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.080]   I use e-max.
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:31.080]   I use the editor.
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:36.600]   He wrote, "Should I stop using e-max because he was a horrible person?"
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.600]   We always have that.
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.600]   It's a really complicated question.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:43.000]   Do you stop listening to their music, stop listening, stop watching "The Beyond--"
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.280]   I still love Michael Jackson's music.
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:47.480]   Should I not like it anymore?
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:48.480]   It's so difficult.
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:50.320]   I'm so conflicted.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:57.480]   I mean, I don't embrace things that either of them did, but at all they're horrible, horrific.
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:00.000]   And the things that Stalman said, horrific.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.440]   And the culture that he and others created MIT, horrific.
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.440]   Right.
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:06.440]   Ethics there.
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:08.640]   We just haven't really sorted that out yet.
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:09.640]   I don't think.
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:14.200]   I don't think-- it's interesting to say I'm not going to use the software tool versus
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:17.240]   I'm not going to listen to Michael Jackson's music.
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:18.320]   One is art.
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:19.800]   One is not.
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:20.800]   Although you could argue--
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:21.800]   Well, that's--
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:22.800]   --as a coding is art.
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:23.800]   But--
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:24.800]   That's a distinction I'm not sure.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:25.800]   That's an art.
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:26.800]   e-max is an art.
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:27.800]   e-max is an amazing thing.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:34.160]   e-max is an art, but music is something different.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:35.160]   And it's an artistic--
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:40.240]   So you're saying it's okay to like Michael Jackson's music, but not to use e-max?
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:42.040]   I think it's the other way around.
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.240]   The other way around, okay.
[01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:47.880]   I certainly am never going to watch a Bill Cosby comedy routine this evening.
[01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:49.360]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.360]   It's gone.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:51.360]   That's over.
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:52.360]   That's--
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:54.160]   My quick thoughts on this is like F-em.
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:57.520]   I mean, it made the world a worse place and I'm not going to support them.
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:00.800]   And anyway, I'm going to try to platform them as fast as I can.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:04.560]   And then you hire for diversity and you put diverse people in charge of the hiring.
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:07.080]   And then you create a way better world for everybody.
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:08.080]   And these things will fall equally--
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:09.080]   This is no idea--
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:10.320]   --hopefully a terrible memory.
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:12.240]   No problem going forward.
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:16.240]   Let's go forward in a positive right way.
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:20.880]   But at the same time, you can't ignore the contributions these people made, even if there
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:22.560]   were horrible people.
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:25.360]   How much of e-max now is still stalmen?
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:26.360]   Because--
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:27.360]   Oh, a lot of it.
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:29.360]   A ton.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:30.360]   There's always Vi.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.360]   You could always switch to Vi.
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:32.360]   Should you not drive a Ford?
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:33.360]   Because Henry Ford was a anti-Semite.
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:36.360]   Right, right, right.
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:37.560]   I mean, we can go on and on.
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:38.560]   This is a--
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:41.520]   You know, should you not listen to Wagner's music because he was a Nazi?
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:43.520]   No, it's--
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:45.680]   I don't think we've kind of figured out the ethics of that yet.
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:46.680]   It's hard.
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:47.680]   It's hard.
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:48.680]   Yeah, it really is.
[01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:49.680]   I think there's no question we all agree.
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:50.760]   Going forward, let's not do this.
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:52.200]   Let's get rid of these people.
[01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:54.520]   Let's not let them taint.
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:58.000]   Going forward, taint, computer science going forward, that's bad.
[01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000]   I don't know.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.720]   It's very difficult.
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:03.480]   I mean, I don't know if Linux would exist if it weren't for Richard Stallman, to be
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:04.480]   honest.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:05.480]   Right.
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:09.240]   Yeah, I mean, it's not black and white.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:15.320]   Well, and you know, while it's not the equivalent, Linus Torvalds is kind of a jerk, too.
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:18.480]   He's a jerk, but so far I don't know if he's a misogynist jerk.
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:20.040]   He's not an accidental lawyer.
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:21.960]   So you're allowed to be a jerk.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:22.960]   I'm a jerk.
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:30.120]   You're allowed to be a jerk, but you're not allowed to discriminate against people because
[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:35.760]   of any for race, gender, religion, and take a field and--
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:37.000]   And prey on them.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.600]   And prey on them, praying on them, even worse, right?
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:44.360]   I don't know if Stallman prayed on women or was just a jerk about women.
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:45.360]   I don't know.
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:46.360]   I really don't.
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.640]   And maybe it's one of the people that he drove out of STEM would have invented something
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:49.640]   better than EMAC.
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:50.640]   Exactly.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:51.640]   He only had denied that to the world.
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:52.640]   Exactly.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:53.640]   Right.
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:54.640]   Let them burn.
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:57.520]   I mean, honestly, you know, the other shoe is going to drop.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.240]   A lot of this is, by the way, because of Jeffrey Epstein, including this.
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:09.240]   The other shoe that's going to drop is Google is Sergey Brin and Schmidt, Eric Schmidt.
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:11.920]   There are, I'm hearing lots of stories about--
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:12.920]   Andy Rubin.
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:18.160]   And we know about any room, very poor behavior that was part of the culture in the early
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:23.320]   days of Google.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.160]   Louise, you're a woman.
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:26.160]   Yeah.
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:27.160]   Yeah.
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:29.560]   I don't know what to say.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:32.480]   No old white man should have a say in this, right?
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:33.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:35.520]   I mean, I think it's complicated.
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:38.360]   And I think it has to be kind of done on an individual basis.
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:42.160]   But I think that the just like canceling is not helpful either.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:47.040]   Like, I think that we have to figure out when we do discover this behavior, like what is
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:49.800]   a good reconciliation, right?
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:52.080]   Like, what kind of justice do we really want here?
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:55.600]   I think that that's something we haven't figured out, especially when the behavior is
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:56.600]   not criminal, right?
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:59.040]   When it's criminal, we have a legal system and it seems clear.
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:02.240]   But with something like Stromman, it's like, yeah, we don't know.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:07.320]   And I think how do you, as a community, especially like, you know, the open software movement
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:08.320]   is a community.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.160]   As a community, how do you deal with that?
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:11.160]   What do you do?
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:12.160]   What do you do?
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:13.160]   And what is justice?
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:16.920]   I think that's something we haven't really figured out, especially not in tech.
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:20.440]   Not to put you on the spot, but is there a discussion at all at Wired?
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:24.360]   Because Stromman had written a number of articles for Wired.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:25.360]   Yeah.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:29.320]   I think it's definitely, I can't like speak for the whole publication, but I think it's
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:33.640]   something that we definitely are thinking about and, you know, looking at for sure.
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:34.640]   Is how do you--
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:40.520]   Do you take it down or do you put a thing up at the front that says a disclaimer?
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:42.520]   And what do you do?
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:43.520]   Right.
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:44.520]   It's so weird.
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:47.800]   Yeah, I think it's something we're still figuring out.
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:48.800]   Yeah.
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:51.160]   How do you give readers that context that they come across that article?
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:55.000]   But yeah, it's still, I think, kind of a real quick question.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:01.440]   I think though, clearly moving forward, this should not stand.
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:03.640]   This kind of behavior is not okay.
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:08.800]   It's not good for anybody, including men who use tech.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:10.240]   It's just not a good thing.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:12.600]   And maybe you use it in every mention of it.
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:18.080]   You use it as an educational opportunity, the announcement and an educational opportunity.
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:20.400]   Has anybody read the Edward Snowden book yet?
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:21.400]   It's coming out.
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:25.000]   There's a good excerpt that's speaking of Wired.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.080]   Why I became a whistleblower?
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:33.640]   I heard him interviewed on NPR and it was kind of interesting to hear his viewpoint.
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:37.680]   One of the weird things is that a lot of people think Edward Snowden is like working for the
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:38.680]   Russian government.
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:44.120]   They can't find that line of thinking kind of strange and not true because he did apply
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.600]   for asylum all across Europe and no one had heard of them.
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:48.600]   You were the only people who had taken?
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:51.640]   Yeah, people would take him and he asked it over and over again.
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:56.840]   I will stand trial as long as I can use public interest defense and the government has said
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:59.480]   over and over again that they won't let him use that defense.
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:06.560]   So he may not have a choice because the Russian visa expires.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:12.040]   I'm not sure when but in the next few years he's possibly going to be kicked out.
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:15.360]   Yeah, that'll be kind of an interesting turning point.
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:19.400]   Now we have this lawsuit that the government wants to seize all the profits from the book
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:23.600]   because he violated his NDA which is just like, "Really?
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:24.960]   Just don't give this guy a break.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:27.000]   Can't even write a book."
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000]   Can't write a book.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.720]   They're not trying to censor the book.
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:34.720]   They're just saying the profits, you can't get the profits of it.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:42.920]   Yeah, now it is interesting that we're still six years later from the disclosures.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:43.920]   Yeah.
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:49.280]   And he's still such an important figure and I'm excited to read the book.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:50.280]   I am too.
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.760]   50 years from now, 100 years from now, the interesting to see or maybe even 20 years
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:54.800]   from now, the interesting to see how he's regarded.
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:55.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:58.840]   You know, I think there's no question he was a man of conscience.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:03.920]   He acted on his conscience and he felt that there was no other way but doing what he did
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:10.120]   that the normal whistleblower route was just not open to him.
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:14.320]   He tried and failed at the NSA to say, "Look, what's going on?
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:15.320]   This is not right.
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:18.600]   This is not legal and was rejected."
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:23.520]   And by the way, we're seeing that being a whistleblower is not necessarily a good position
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:24.520]   to be in.
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:25.520]   Right.
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.520]   Right.
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:27.520]   Wow.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:28.520]   Oh, it's huge risk.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:29.520]   It's huge risk.
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:30.520]   Yeah.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:31.520]   Yeah.
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.420]   So maybe I understand why he did what he did.
[02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:35.400]   I think he did it out of conscience.
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:41.080]   He didn't do it at a maliciousness or out of some sort of profit motive.
[02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:45.320]   He did it a very brave thing because he was a patriot.
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:46.320]   He believed he was a patriot.
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:51.280]   So you have to respect that much anyway, whatever you feel about what he did.
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:56.280]   I think he did it in a very sane way actually, trying to protect the people whose secrets
[02:05:56.280 --> 02:06:00.880]   he was revealing by sending it to a number of newspapers, having them vet it to make
[02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:07.220]   sure that anything that was released to the public wasn't a secure, did not compromise
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:09.500]   US security or the security of individuals overseas.
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:13.500]   I think it's easy to say, but if they believed it was that important, they could have tried
[02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:15.260]   to make a lot of it and say, "We need this.
[02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:16.260]   Give us this right."
[02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:17.260]   Right.
[02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:18.260]   Give us this law.
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:19.260]   Right.
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:20.260]   Well.
[02:06:20.260 --> 02:06:21.260]   Okay, kids.
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:22.260]   Shh.
[02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:23.260]   Safe finny.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:27.180]   Thank you so much for being here, Luis.
[02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:28.900]   Ms. Akas from Wired.
[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:29.900]   What are you working on right now?
[02:06:29.900 --> 02:06:33.040]   What's your next big story?
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:36.680]   I'm tracking down some stuff about Amazon that I don't want to say too much about right
[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:40.280]   now, but that is a story that just keeps on giving, isn't it?
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:41.280]   Yeah.
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:42.280]   It's such a big sprawling company.
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:44.520]   It's been really fun to do a lot of Amazon reporting.
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.040]   What a great beat.
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:47.040]   What a great beat.
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:48.040]   Yeah.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:51.320]   If you get any weird orders on Amazon or it's funny, I think strange.
[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:53.120]   Feel free to hit me up.
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:54.120]   Okay.
[02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:55.120]   Okay.
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:57.760]   Like that book costing, my book costing $800.
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:06:58.760]   Yeah.
[02:06:58.760 --> 02:06:59.760]   I'll take that.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.920]   Somebody, somebody found an out of print.
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.900]   One of my print books is out of print.
[02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:06.700]   The Leo reports guide to Tivo on Amazon.
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:11.340]   It costs as much as a Tivo now with a subscription.
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:12.340]   It's exactly.
[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:14.360]   Let me just check to see.
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:15.460]   Is that the kind of thing?
[02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:16.460]   Well, there.
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:18.240]   Let me just check to see.
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:19.740]   I'm searching for it.
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:20.740]   Here it is.
[02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:21.740]   Yeah.
[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:22.740]   $860.48.
[02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:26.660]   I don't think that's a fair price.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:27.860]   Maybe it's signed Leo.
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:30.060]   Even if it's signed.
[02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:33.740]   I got a right to Gareth Branwin.
[02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:36.260]   He's the guy who really put the work in on this.
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:39.620]   Gareth, you know our book is worth $860.48.
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:41.260]   Why the 48 cents?
[02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:44.220]   Like where does that come from?
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:45.580]   That's what makes it look legit Leo.
[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:47.580]   That's how you do it.
[02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:48.740]   Oh, the rub move.
[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:50.580]   There's the 860 to Pro move.
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:53.180]   There's two used for the same price.
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:54.700]   There's one do and two use.
[02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:56.940]   They all cost the same price.
[02:07:56.940 --> 02:07:57.940]   They record it.
[02:07:57.940 --> 02:07:58.940]   There's two.
[02:07:58.940 --> 02:07:59.940]   Wait a minute.
[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:00.940]   Here's one for $992.
[02:08:00.940 --> 02:08:05.140]   And it's worth the nerve to charge you $4 shipping and handling.
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:06.620]   That is nervy.
[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:10.740]   Look, I think I should get free shipping for that.
[02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:11.740]   She's Louise.
[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:15.540]   Leo, if you have a few in your basement, you can put your kids through college again.
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:17.580]   I'm telling you, I probably got a hundred of them.
[02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:19.620]   I could really make a kill in here.
[02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:21.580]   That's even just one at a time real slow.
[02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:24.180]   Real slow.
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:29.140]   The funny thing is the book is completely useless because for the series one Tivo, which is long,
[02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:33.180]   which is long gone, it doesn't have anything to do with a modern Tivo.
[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:36.980]   Probably super popular in some small island and they're hoarding.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:40.380]   Some algorithm said, no, no, you should charge 800 bucks or this thing.
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:41.380]   Some algorithm somewhere.
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.380]   Kent County, Ireland.
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:44.380]   It's a future explanation.
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:46.540]   Loise on wired.com.
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:48.780]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:49.780]   Thank you.
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:50.780]   There she is.
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:53.540]   Does everybody who writes for wired get that beautiful?
[02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:56.140]   Graphic of their picture?
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:58.140]   Yeah, everyone on staff does.
[02:08:58.140 --> 02:08:59.140]   Yeah.
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:00.140]   That's very cool.
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:02.940]   Did you pose for it or did they just do it?
[02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:04.780]   I just decided a picture.
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:06.700]   It's not a picture.
[02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:10.980]   That's their version of the dot drawings that you get if you ever get a profile on Wall
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:11.980]   Street Journal.
[02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:13.620]   That's on my list of things.
[02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:14.620]   Yeah.
[02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:17.020]   The New Yorker has like little drawings too.
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:18.020]   Yeah.
[02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:19.020]   Yeah.
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:20.020]   Yeah.
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:21.020]   Any one of those I'd take it.
[02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:22.020]   Thank you, Dwight Silverman.
[02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:27.580]   That's the new article.com/techburger or get his brand new newsletter for free, Houston
[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:30.580]   Chronicle.com/releasenotes.
[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:34.220]   I almost said release this.
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:35.220]   Release notes.
[02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:36.220]   Release notes.
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:37.220]   Release notes.
[02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:39.420]   We just did a survey of the readership.
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:44.060]   It came back with some really interesting results and we're making some changes in it.
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:45.380]   But it's been really popular.
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:50.540]   It's one of the fastest growing newsletters that we've got and the reaction has just been
[02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:51.540]   wonderful.
[02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:53.540]   It takes a lot of work.
[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:54.540]   Oh.
[02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:55.540]   So I know.
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:56.540]   That's why I don't do a newsletter.
[02:09:56.540 --> 02:10:03.700]   But I have a big fun and I really appreciate the reaction that the people have had to.
[02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:06.340]   It's so great to see you again, Dwight.
[02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:08.420]   Renee, I'll get to see you in just a couple of days.
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:10.340]   Renee Richie is a hard.
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:15.380]   No, he's showing up today because he can't come.
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:17.300]   Oh, this is in lieu of a Tuesday?
[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:18.300]   Yes.
[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:21.340]   Oh, well, can we just take all of his bits and insert them into Tuesday?
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:24.140]   I'll get the editors working on that right now.
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:25.620]   I bet you we could.
[02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:26.620]   Deep fake myself.
[02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:27.620]   Yeah.
[02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:31.460]   Deep fake Renee, Renee is at imore.com/vector.
[02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:32.460]   That's a bite.
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:33.460]   It has so many videos.
[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:35.500]   All the reviews of the new phones.
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:38.300]   He calls it the new Night King, the iPhone 11.
[02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:39.900]   I love that.
[02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:40.900]   They're all there.
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:42.060]   At least a month.
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:45.620]   That's hard working, hard working guy.
[02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:46.620]   So no Tuesday.
[02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:48.060]   Are you going somewhere?
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:49.060]   Yeah.
[02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:52.380]   Laurie Gill and I have our first big corporate meet-up.
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:53.380]   I'm going to launch it.
[02:10:53.380 --> 02:10:56.620]   Because we're part of a sprawling-- no, they're doing it in New York, I think, because that's
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:10:58.820]   where the US operation is.
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:10:59.820]   Fun.
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:01.820]   Oh, we've got to go meet our new corporate overlords.
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.820]   Have a good time.
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:03.820]   Hope they take mercy on us.
[02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:04.820]   Yeah.
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:05.820]   Good luck.
[02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:06.820]   Thank you.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:07.820]   Thank you.
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:13.620]   I'm a little disappointed to find that you can also buy the Leoliport's Guide to Tevo for
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:17.300]   six pounds, 49 pence in the UK.
[02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:20.100]   Why isn't it in England so the here, Leo?
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:21.100]   Man.
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:22.100]   Arbitrage.
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:23.100]   There you go.
[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:24.100]   The book Arbitrage.
[02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:27.100]   I could be rich.
[02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:29.660]   Probably has the UK spellings for optimize.
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:31.060]   Yes, yes.
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:32.060]   Collor.
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:35.060]   We do use really rock down the valley.
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:37.140]   Oh, man.
[02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:39.620]   It's being sold from Richmond, Texas.
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:40.620]   That's interesting.
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:41.620]   Oh, in Richmond.
[02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:42.620]   In Richmond.
[02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:44.540]   I got to go down there and pick up a couple of cops.
[02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:45.940]   Ergo de books.
[02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:48.540]   That's a funny name.
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:53.660]   Ergo de books is selling my book for a mere six pounds.
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:55.020]   That's just down the road.
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:11:56.020]   Yeah.
[02:11:56.020 --> 02:11:57.780]   Go ask him why that other guys charge.
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:11:58.780]   I will.
[02:11:58.780 --> 02:11:59.780]   I will.
[02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:00.980]   And why he's not charging 800.
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:03.940]   We know it's a whole thing going on here.
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:09.340]   We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon after the radio show about 230 Pacific, 530
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:11.900]   Eastern time, 2130 UTC.
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:14.660]   You can ask your Amazon Echo to play it.
[02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:18.460]   Just say, echo play Twit Live.
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:21.340]   And it'll play whatever is going on in the live stream at that time.
[02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:27.580]   You can also go to our website, twit.tv/live and watch video or listen to audio of our show.
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:30.940]   If you're doing that, you should certainly be in the chat room where everybody else who's
[02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:36.460]   listening live or watching live is hanging out at irc.twit.tv.
[02:12:36.460 --> 02:12:39.660]   On demand versions of the show will be available as soon as our editors can cut out all the
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:41.460]   bad stuff.
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:45.780]   This could take a long time tonight.
[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:47.900]   You can know they don't cut anything out.
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:49.060]   Everything is kept in.
[02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:52.540]   We might bleed Louise a couple of times because she said.
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:54.540]   I apologize.
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:56.380]   Potty mouth Louise.
[02:12:56.380 --> 02:12:57.740]   I'm very sorry.
[02:12:57.740 --> 02:12:59.740]   I'm very sorry.
[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:02.260]   In both cases, very appropriate.
[02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:07.380]   Just go to twit.tv and you'll find our show there or subscribe and Apple podcast, Google
[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:11.580]   podcast, pocket cast, Spotify, Stitcher, any podcast app.

[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:14.660]   Subscribe.
[02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:17.900]   You'll get it every Sunday, the minute it's available just in time for your Monday morning
[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:18.900]   commute.
[02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:22.540]   If you want to join us in studio, what great studio audience we had.
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:25.460]   Really nice to have you all from all over the world.
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:30.380]   If you want to be in studio, just email tickets@twit.tv/shame to come all the way from New Zealand or
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:33.220]   the UK or Germany and then the doors are locked.
[02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:34.820]   So do email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:36.420]   Make sure you can get in.
[02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:40.540]   We do love having you here.
[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:41.700]   I guess that's it.
[02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:44.780]   All I have to say is another twit is in the can.
[02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:45.460]   Bye bye.
[02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:48.040]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:50.620]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:53.200]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:55.780]   (upbeat music)
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:57.960]   (ball curling)
