[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.280]   It's time for Twit. This week in Tech, the show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.440]   We have been on a roll lately with great panels. This one is no exception. Christina Warren
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.840]   is here senior cloud advocate for Microsoft and dot com. She is film girl. She is on rocket
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.880]   that wonderful podcast that you do with our good friend, Brianna Wu and Simone good friends
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.080]   Simone Dorsch for who's name I love saying. Hello, Christina. Hey, Leo. How are you? How
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.280]   are the sneakers? The sneakers are awesome. I've got some in the background. I haven't
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.800]   bought actually. I haven't bought any new ones in a while, but there are some big drops
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.200]   happening in April that I'm going to totally take L's on and then over pay on stock X.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   But going well later in the show, we will explain what she just said. Big drops are
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.080]   coming. That's the only thing I got. Big drops are coming. Big drops are coming. Also
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   joining us speaking of big drops. It's Ian Thompson from the register dot yote dot co dot
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   uk who is not paying in a bottle as we speak. Look, I was just refilling my water. Okay.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.840]   Okay. Whatever you say. I don't hold it against you. Hello Ian. Good to see you. I
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.400]   set the register dot co dot uk. That's the old address now register the register dot
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.360]   com. Indeed. Yes, we switched over. But such is life. It is the way in the internet world.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.120]   But very nice to be here. You have joined us once again with your groaning board of books
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.320]   that that bookshelf does not look stable. I'm tough. Yeah, I guess living in a quick zone.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.640]   Yeah, I have actually, you know, bolted the bookshelf to well, that's good to the wall.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.680]   But I can't help things. Some friends of mine have wires going across. But if the ground
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.280]   starts shaking, I'm just saying leap to your left or well probably to your left. Yeah,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.240]   it looks like the right's also. Oh, when I first came over here, I was such a newbie.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.360]   I had a bookshelf above the bed. Oh, this is not what you do. Let's ask you to travel.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.000]   Oh, that's hysterical. That's hysterical. And Doc Rock, there are no earthquakes in Hawaii.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.400]   But Doc Rock does his best to make the earth move every week. You get minor earthquakes
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:30.200]   when the volcano erupts and just so you know, Leo, I am ready. I'm amazed at how much play
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.760]   that story the Amazon drivers story got. I guess my feeling is it's not really a tech
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.000]   story. Yes, Amazon, I guess, is kind of a tech company. But it's really much more of
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.440]   a labor story. Yeah. And it's a shame that that's what we've gotten to. Let's protect
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.760]   workers in these tech companies. You'd think they're so insanely profitable that this wouldn't
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.680]   be an issue. I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed with the tone of the Amazon
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.120]   news tweets that came out. It's like, you don't believe that being in bottles thing,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.840]   do you? Well, they backed out. Yeah, we do believe it. Yeah. And in fact, the official
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.600]   Yeah, the official Amazon Twitter account has now apologized. I guess we're doing the
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.960]   story. I guess we're going in folks. They said for any that the tweet, see, there's
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   some tech. The tweet was incorrect and quote, did not contemplate our large driver population.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.680]   And instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers from which I'm taking. Yeah, the
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.720]   drivers peeing bottles all the time. They're not employees that see the this is how they're
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.920]   getting around that there because the most time the drivers see the drivers work for a vendor.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.600]   They have a number of different driving services who contract with Amazon. So they're not actually
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.840]   paid by Amazon. Whereas the fulfillment centers, as far as I know, they might have some outsourcing,
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.200]   but as far as I know, everybody who works at the fulfillment center is is employed by
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:14.280]   Amazon. The Amazon apology goes on and on and on. It's got bullet points as numbered.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.800]   First, the tweet was incorrect. Second, our process was flawed. Third, we know that drivers
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.000]   do and have trouble finding restrooms. This is a long standing industry wide issue.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.400]   By the way, I might add to that podcast host also sometimes are stuck in front of a microphone
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.480]   for hours at a time. They are slightly right though. Okay, no one's going to want to hear
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   this, but this is just facts is true. My grandpa was a truck driver. My dad was a truck driver.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.000]   And yeah, when you have long hauls overnight and you're in the rush, maybe you have a
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.360]   bonus because, but like Christina said, they had their trucks. So they were responsible
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.600]   and it was a thing. So they're kind of right, but not right. You know what I mean? Like
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.160]   they're going for the fact that yes, you can get a holding one on the golf course, but
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   how often? Right. That's
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.360]   a way to me. Was that an analogy? Hold on now. I would say the difference too is that because
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.600]   you're exactly right, Doc, like this isn't a new problem and people who are truck drivers
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.320]   have dealt with this for years. What I do think is new is that people are penalized,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.480]   don't get work assignments, have quotas to fill for how many packages they deliver. That's
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.920]   what's different here. And I think that that's the thing where it's not the same where if
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.000]   you're doing a long haul trucking thing, yeah, you might have instances where it's overnight
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.400]   or whatever and you have to make do, but you're not in this situation where you say, okay,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:50.720]   I have to deliver 70, 80 parcels in this shift. I don't have time to go find a place to go
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.120]   and know where they go. What do they go to the gas station? Where do they even? Right.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:00.240]   And then even worse, if I do, if I miss this window, then I'm penalized and I can't book
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.800]   a future assignment. Like to me, that's the difference. I think that's true of UPS and
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.920]   FedEx as well. I sometimes I'll get a package at eight in the evening because my poor UPS
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.960]   guy had so many packages to deliver. He's working a 14 hour shift trying to get them all
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.480]   out of the truck. Yeah, I don't think that their quotas are quite as intense as the Amazon ones,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.120]   although I'm sure that they're bad. I don't know if their labor practices are quite as poor.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.840]   But so you can you can blame Amazon for this. Well,
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.360]   when you can do Amazon because the UPS guy is doing what delivering Amazon package.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.560]   Yeah. It's the same thing at the end of the day. I thought really about buying one of those
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.080]   blue trucks a couple of years ago when I was getting rid of the co-working space. And so
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.840]   that's the other thing, you know, like Christina said, in the beginning, a lot of the guys that
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.400]   own the blue trucks, they might own it themselves or they work for the owner. The owner can have
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.480]   five or six trucks. You know, it's it's positive. They're they're not employees and I get it, but
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.720]   they're really messing with the verbiage a little bit, if you will. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   Yeah. No, exactly. The Amazon set standards like for those vendors, right? So it's ultimately
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.960]   still an Amazon kind of thing because Amazon is telling those those, you know, owners of the
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.240]   blue trucks, they're saying if you don't have this delivery ratio, we won't keep you as a vendor.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:31.440]   So ultimately Amazon has demanded that their drivers consent to surveillance in the vans.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.520]   I mean, I mean, the whole Amazon ethos seems to be built around this
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:44.560]   McKinsey-eyed thing of this is how you must work most efficiently and that it completely ignores
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.160]   human problems. But this is what you can do within a certain timeframe. And the Amazon cameras
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:57.040]   thing is just a it's great litigation cover for Amazon. But also it enables the work time process
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.280]   thing to go on and people to be squeezed to the last ounce. I mean, at least there's jobs, right?
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.280]   And sometimes jobs, especially in some parts of the country are hard to come by.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.720]   I wish that companies, even big companies like Amazon would stop thinking of humans
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.800]   as cogs in a machine. Because I think that's not a great way to treat people.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   Right? Yeah, it's like Lucy making chocolates at the conveyor belt. You know,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:36.240]   and I guess it probably started with Henry Ford and the and the assembly line. You know,
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.120]   that's that was the first time humans were really seen as parts in a larger machine,
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.400]   not as human beings, but as actual parts. Well, it goes back further than that, Leo. We're not
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.800]   going to get into that. But I mean, there are things before the assembly line where human labor
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:58.160]   was used. And yeah, I think the difference is that we haven't seen like it's weird because
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.720]   of the United States, I think, at least from my perspective, and maybe this is my own eye of a
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.560]   day, but in the time that I've been alive, we haven't had a lot of manufacturing in the United
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.520]   States. It had mostly been outsourced. I mean, we still had car plants and whatnot, but a lot of
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   it have been outsourced. And so this like notion of a lot of kind of some of the labor and I think
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.480]   some of the labor policies or things that we as Westerners haven't had to think about because so
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.520]   much of our stuff has been assembled in other countries where we hear about the poor labor
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.560]   practices, but we can rail against it, but we can also kind of forget about it because we have
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.960]   that privilege of being like, well, it's not in my backyard. Whereas when it comes to this
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.760]   fulfillment stuff and when it comes to a lot of these logistical things and things that were
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.600]   formerly referred to as gig working, I don't think that that's really a correct term anymore.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.360]   We have to start taking these broader labor practices into account. And a lot of the
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.320]   things that we look at are not very different than some of the labor, you know, battles that
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.240]   unions and other labor groups fought for 50, 60, 100 years ago.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.120]   Well, somebody in the chatroom said it goes back to slaves in ancient Egypt building the
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:18.000]   pyramids. I guess they were also cogs in a machine. So yeah, and well, it's funny because a lot of
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.160]   the stuff that happened in middle Asia happened long before the pyramids too. So it's been around
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.840]   for a hot minute. One of the things that that comes to mind as well though, is everyone hears
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.960]   these stories and everyone gets the feels about it. But then how many people are willing to go back
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.880]   to seven day shipping? I mean, I'm okay with it. I'm kind of used to it anyway. But how many people
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:48.000]   wear it that can be most affected by this are actually willing to forego their instant gratification
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.080]   in order to do something about what has happened. So I think part of this could go away. If we all
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.200]   say, look, dude, we love crime. No, but you can make your package come a day later. No, rather than
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.800]   not giving it up. No, no, you're dead on. No, I don't mean cancel prime because that's not going
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.480]   to happen. I love prime. Let's give this not giving it up. But I wanted to be instead of being
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:17.040]   20 minutes or instead of being the next day, can we back it up a day? You know, like, let's try
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.240]   add 24 hours to prime and see if that helps. If that doesn't work, let's add another 24.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.200]   But you know, let's not harm people. And I don't think most of the I don't think most of the people
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.520]   that have prime would agree to that right now because they're so in love with I forgot it. No big
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.040]   E. I'll prime it. Let's new your dead on. Let's change the same way. Yeah, sorry. Go on. Let's change
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.560]   to some happy news. Microsoft build is coming up. You've announced it officially. That's going to
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.520]   be a big deal for you, right? Because you deal with developers. This is the big developer conference.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.560]   Yeah, I deal with developers and I'm not 100% sure what my shift is going to be, but I am going to be
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.880]   one of the hosts that are live. So yeah, virtual again, was there much discussion
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.320]   over whether to do this virtual or live? Yeah, I think that I don't think there was for this one.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:13.760]   I think it was we we announced sometime last year that all of FY 21, which is our fiscal year,
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:20.960]   which ends July 1st was going to be virtual events. So we knew like from the offset, we had yeah,
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.400]   exactly. So we had both of both Ignites, but the spring and the winter or the fall like night were
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:33.120]   virtual Microsoft build was virtual. Last year was our first one we had to do. It was a
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.680]   real all hands on deck sort of situation. We were flying blind. We didn't really know what we
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.240]   were doing. And you got good at you got you got you got it now done. Yeah, yeah, now we've done
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.160]   like four or five of them. And you know, the crew we've been working with similar crews, similar,
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.960]   like writing staff, similar event programmers and whatnot. So I feel like we have a good method
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.800]   down. I'm very personally very hopeful that, you know, obviously next year, it will be back to
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.520]   in person, but I don't think that the virtual component is ever going to go away. I want to ask
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.160]   like a good thing because you know, we talk about it all the time as as journalists going to these
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.720]   events or people covering these events. And for us, I think most people say this is great. The
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:23.040]   information is more condensed. It's easier to absorb. I don't have to compete for a ticket or fly to
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.200]   Redmond or anywhere else. So it's a I like these virtual conferences a lot. But I'm curious because
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.920]   I think there's some people want to want that hands on face to face. And from your side is
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.440]   somebody who's relating developers for Microsoft, you feel the same way you need that personal touch.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:46.320]   Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's I'm happy that it's not going to go away because in the past,
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.400]   what we've done is that we had like, you know, video, you know, we recorded sessions, we have
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.200]   the point that we recorded all of our sessions and we had like a live shoot with broadcast,
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.560]   you know, on the internet, but it was always kind of seen the virtual experience was always
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.280]   a second class citizen. And so if you're watching remotely, and we know this is journalists, we know
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.800]   this is people who can attend every conference. You know, you didn't really feel like you were
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.560]   there. It was always kind of an afterthought. And and I used to produce the channel line live
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:22.240]   or the build live show and then that became the show, which was kind of funny, you know, that that
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.200]   model kind of became the show and which was fun for me to kind of see, but it was also kind of scary
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.400]   because you're like, this was this thing we sort of did in private that had no adult supervision.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.560]   And now this is the real thing. And so a lot of other people who were better at stuff than
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.880]   than we got involved. It's fun to watch because channel line for a long time,
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.680]   really, people didn't even know about it. It was really right. It was like the skunk works thing
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:51.040]   completely. Suddenly it's front. You're right. It's front and center. It's front and center. And
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.000]   the stuff that we were doing before has kind of become the model. So on the one hand, I'm really
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.080]   glad that we're not going to be abandoning that because I think that as you said, more people than
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.640]   ever can attend. It is more flexible and it just works. Having said that, I personally, and I've
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.360]   this has always been the case for me in conferences. There's so much value that I get, not so much
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.520]   from attending the sessions in person, although there can be some of that might be able to have
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.240]   the opportunity to ask a question or there's a really amazing demo and you're like, oh, I see
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.600]   it and I'm there. But it's the side way. It's like the hallway conversations. It's the
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   serendipitous meeting of people. It's that stuff that to me has always been the biggest value of
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.560]   any conference. And that's whether it's something like Microsoft Build or WWDC or something like
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.800]   South by Southwest or Mac world, which is, I believe, where you and I first met.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:47.200]   Yeah. Those are the things that I knew about you from Twitter, but it wasn't till we met.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.520]   That's when you make the real relationship start. Exactly. So that's the thing, the
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.440]   party is the hallway conversations, the serendipitous things. There's a conference. I remember you
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.720]   sitting on the floor at Mac world Expo, eating your lunch and coming up to you saying film girl.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:10.800]   Yup. And yeah, there's a conference I go to in Portland called XOXO. It's my favorite conference.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.600]   Yes. It's my absolute favorite. And I've, they're people, they're relationships I've met there.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:22.640]   They're people who I don't ever see any time other than a XOXO. We don't ever talk outside of that,
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:28.800]   but we somehow run into each other at XOXO have a great time. And you know, and those are the
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.200]   things that you can't capture virtually. And I don't think you should capture virtually.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.160]   But I do feel like from a conference perspective, the content itself shouldn't be
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:44.800]   siloed and behind a wall, you know, where we're like, you have to fly out and take a stick.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.160]   But these developer conferences are so big, there's usually a lottery to get in,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.520]   not everybody who wants to can. Exactly. And that's what's been great. It's really
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.440]   democratized this. So, so build, it's now official is the 25th of May starts.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.200]   And Microsoft also announced that the campus is not going to open until September 7th. It
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:10.800]   was going to open in July. That also seems sensible. Yeah. What's the worry, right?
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.680]   Are is Microsoft going to do what other companies have done and said, look,
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:18.400]   I think they said what one, you could three days a week, you can work at home, something like that.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   Yeah, I think it's going to be a hybrid model. And what they'd announced before is that we can,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.880]   they're much more open to people, especially it depends on what team you're on. Not every team
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   can work this way, but they're much more open to people working from a row locations.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.560]   Which he is laughing at this because he's never left his house.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.880]   Right, right. But historically, and this was weird to me,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.560]   you know, I moved from New York to Seattle to take the job at Microsoft. And it was a little
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.440]   odd to me because I thought, you know, it was such a big company and they knew they had offices
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.200]   all over the place. I figured like Microsoft would be a really remote friendly place.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.080]   And some teams were and the team that I work on was before any of this, we had people all over the
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.720]   world, but there were certain teams where it was very much like, if you want to work on this team,
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:07.680]   you have to be in Redmond. And that's changed for every team. Yeah, not for every team, but that's
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.840]   changed. And I think that's going to continue to change. But I think the model going forward
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.080]   is going to be a hybrid, which I personally appreciate because I like being able to work from home,
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.120]   but I'm not going to lie. I live, you know, I pay a lot of money in rent and I live in a relatively
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:27.760]   small apartment. Would you move back to New York? I don't know. I would think about it, but I think
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:33.440]   for what I do, I still, they still need me on campus to, you know, do in studio stuff and things
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.120]   like that. But I like the idea of being able to work from home a couple of days and then go into
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.920]   an office. The thing that I've missed and it's been difficult for me is that like,
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:51.200]   I've given up half my living space for work. And so you lose the whole separation of your
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   network. You never are. This is what I'm saying, right? Like you never, you don't have that
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.000]   separation. Yeah, change in this one. Yeah. I mean, I've gone from now, it's basically eight to
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.440]   eight days. And yeah, okay, I don't spend two hours sitting on bar. And you don't have to be in a
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:13.680]   bottle because you have a toilet in the house, right? Yeah, no, but it's just, you know, that work,
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:20.640]   that boundary between work and home, it dissolves. Yes. And it blurs very badly. It's actually why
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.080]   I still come into the studio. I don't have to. But I, but I want to make a distinction between
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:32.560]   being at home. Right. Very early on when I started doing the radio show, I realized I could do it at
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.240]   home. And I did at first. But the energy level was terrible because I would kind of, I mean, I
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.360]   kind of be in my jammies and I slump over into the studio and I'd start doing the show. And it just,
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.840]   there's something about getting dressed, getting in the car, driving to the office and doing it
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:53.440]   just sets, it's a set and setting that really gets you up for the show. Doc Rock, you are, we work
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.720]   at home all the time, right? Well, no, it's a hybrid. So I am going to agree with you 100%
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:04.240]   that working in the house could be dangerous because working in the house is easy to like
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.040]   show up with like half dressed and, you know, parties down the bottom. It's just not, you're
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.160]   not in the right frame of mind. You know, the wardrobe. Right. So here's what I did. Yes. And
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.680]   this has been the best thing I've ever done. In Mike condo, there's commercial section in the
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.480]   bottom. Okay. So I rented a commercial space in the bottom of my condo. So you have a little
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.080]   business center downstairs. Yes. That's really smart. Even quarantine, I can just ride the elevator
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:36.240]   down, cut through the back where the garbage things are and never be illegally outside. You
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:42.080]   know what I mean? Like, so I can come to my studio. So I have my studio here in the basement of my
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.320]   condo. But it is separate enough that I can be in a different frame of reference. Interesting.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.880]   There's this my studio. I do work. But if I get hungry in the middle of the day,
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.520]   or, you know, in the time that you do a commercial, I can seriously run upstairs, go to the loo,
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.800]   and then run back downstairs and be done. So yeah, I'm kind of in a good space because it's half,
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.080]   half, and I didn't have to take over any space in the house. And so I guess that's been good.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.000]   That's brilliant. That's actually brilliant. Because I really do think
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.400]   even if it's just going downstairs, there's a set that changes, your mindset changes.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.840]   What do you do? And did you used to go into the register?
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.160]   Oh, yeah. And I mean, honestly, I'm really, really missing days in the office because,
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:36.000]   I mean, I'm sorry, Instant Messenger is a pretty poor excuse for just turning your
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.160]   shoulder and having a conversation with someone. It starts to feel kind of
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.240]   edited. Like, like, like, erid, like a desert. It starts to feel like there's no juice there.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.040]   Yeah. I mean, some people have dealt with it very well. Some stuff have dealt with it less
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.880]   well, but we've worked it out. I just saw a study setting standards is important. You know,
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.560]   you've got to actually get, I feel the urge to brush my teeth before doing the news meeting on
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:08.400]   video, you know, it's just, you've got to set some standards. And as as Doc says, you know,
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:14.320]   you've got to have that separation. I just saw a study, which I thought was quite interesting,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:21.520]   that extroverts for extroverts pandemic has been horrible. But introverts have thrived.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:28.160]   Oh, yes. One of my besties right now is the self-proclaimed introvert. She is like,
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.640]   I don't know what y'all have had about it. I've been doing this. I don't want to,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.000]   I don't want it to end. I don't want it to end. I don't want it to end. So much work done.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.080]   I don't want to see people. True story. Every time we're like,
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.680]   that is just laughing because the rest of us are like, Hey, we want to get out. We want to do this.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.880]   And that is like, I don't know what you guys are talking about. I'm cool being right here.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.400]   I can do this after that. Go watch anime, drink coffee. I don't know. Yes.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:54.560]   Although I would say, I mean, I'm definitely an extrovert. So that's my own bias there. But,
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.120]   you know, I have a lot of friends who consider themselves introverts or sometimes like a weird
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.120]   kind of hybrid thing where they appear to be extroverts, but are really introverts or whatever.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.040]   And I think that some people have thrived, but some people when you, because this has been such
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.080]   a traumatic experience for all of us, it has been kind of the normal thing. I wonder how many of
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:19.440]   these people have truly thrived in that way. And how much of it is like the lack of any sort
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.320]   of interaction at all and the interaction you do have has been like this, you know, space between
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.640]   you way, like I actually, I actually wonder how much people really thrive because we are social
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:36.080]   creatures. I think introverts think they're thriving. Yeah. But in fact, there's, I'm looking at a post
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:43.520]   from late last year, a SciPost, psychology post introverts, faring worse than extroverts,
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:49.360]   probably because we feel like, Oh, this is good. We should enjoy this. But even an introvert needs
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:55.280]   to be around people if they don't even if we sit in the corner shyly and don't talk to anybody.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:02.560]   You need that. You need that stimuli. Yeah. What it is, there is a victory when an introvert gets
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:08.000]   to tell an introvert, nah, player, I'm gonna stay home. I'm gonna stay, right? They don't get the
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.240]   opportunity to shut people down. You're actually feeling part of their tikka belt. You don't get
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:18.400]   to feel superior to other people. Yeah. Yeah. So you take that away. I guarantee you it has
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   the fact it's I'm joking. Yes. But that's also I think most of my introverts fans love the shutdown
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.320]   and they don't get to do that. Yeah, that might be that might be true. You might have hit it. You
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.200]   might have hit on something. Yeah, that's actually a good point. Mobile World Congress is still gonna
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:39.520]   happen. I can't believe that. That's strange. Join us in Barcelona, they say.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:47.360]   June 28th. Now I admit I love Barcelona, but Barcelona's been one of the hardest hit cities
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:54.000]   for COVID-19. It's a great city, but they're asking for 50,000 people to come into the city.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.080]   Seems like a bad idea. That's absolutely insane with no vaccination reports at all.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.360]   Now, okay, I love conferences. As we were talking before, I miss them a lot.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.840]   Lobbycon, you know, the rest of it. But seriously, Mobile World Congress, Google said it's pulling out
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.520]   pretty much everyone that said they're pulling out. Why on earth would you go there? They were
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:22.000]   the canary in the coal mine last year. Yeah. They were planning a live thing. But in February,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.400]   I can't remember. And one by one, all of the big attendees said, you know, we're not gonna go.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.240]   So they shut down. And it was, I think, the very first conference to say, yeah, we can't do it.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.800]   They're now through the very first conference to go back. And I note on their webpage,
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.840]   they've got a big statement from Verizon CEO saying, we can't wait.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:49.280]   I wonder how much of this was contractually bound, maybe based on their commitments to
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:56.880]   some of the locations or, you know, like prepayments or other things, because it seems awfully soon,
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.680]   especially as Ian points out, you don't have any vaccination rates beyond that. This is an
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.080]   international conference where you have people from all over the world. And we were talking
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:11.120]   before the show about, you know, what the process has been in the United States. But to be honest,
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.400]   at least based on people I've been talking to globally, as bad as the US has been with everything
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.680]   pandemic and coronavirus. And we've been one of the worst countries to deal with it.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.800]   We have a better handle, at least, I think, you know, and vaccinating a number of people than,
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.640]   yeah, because we bought all the vaccines. So no one else can have it. Well, right,
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.120]   because we're the United States. And that's what we do. So, so I look at something like mobile world
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.560]   Congress where most of the attendees, I mean, because I've been to that conference a number of
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.320]   times and it's a great conference, but it is an international conference. So you're talking
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.280]   about not just brain and scary, 50,000 people, but 50,000 people from regions that might not
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.120]   have vaccinations at all, might not have other things into an area where we don't know what the,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.240]   you know, vaccination rates going to even be like, I just feel like for the city of Barcelona,
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.080]   if I were a citizen in Barcelona, I'd be pretty angry, to be honest.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:08.320]   The second shoot of fall was last year was South by Southwest. And that one was a heartbreaker.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.320]   They didn't want it. They didn't want it. And then the city held off.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.560]   They held off and the city of Austin, I think, ended up saying the city did it.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.160]   The city did it. And and yeah, and it hurt because they didn't have their entrance
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.880]   didn't cover them. Like it was bad. Like really hit them.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.080]   Amy Webb was talking about that. She did the virtual South by she did it again this year.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:35.680]   But I love it. The South by now has said, we'll see in 2022. I am just, I hope, you know, all
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:42.080]   knock on wood. I hope all goes well. The vaccine is widely distributed, which will slow down the
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.200]   spread of it. And we can we can go back a little bit because as much as I'm gonna say, I mean, I'm
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.600]   pretty much resign myself to we're not gonna do a DEF CON this summer.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:57.520]   That's another big loss. This year, next year, we are gonna have one hell of a party.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.520]   DEF CON, probably more than almost any other conferences about personal
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:08.800]   interaction. It's a fun show to go to. It's the best show of the year. It's the only thing that
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.440]   would get me to the last Vegas. It's simple as a particularly in August of all times.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.400]   Yeah, that's oh good. Yes. It's brutal in August and Vegas at last time I was in Vegas in August.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.600]   It was 122. Oh my God. My skin was coming off. Nobody goes out. I really missed conferences.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:29.440]   So I would love to see this stuff get straightened out. You know, I had just planned this time last
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:35.920]   year to go to Seattle. I would have been just on my way back actually. And then I had planned to go
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.960]   to two of the big YouTube conferences. And you know, it's just weird to get those taken away.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:48.400]   I was going through photos today and I remember Mackerel 2013, I came to go visit. Oh yeah.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:55.520]   Yeah, they're in the studio. Right. So like just the idea of missing stuff like that or,
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:01.120]   you know, coming to do a lot of taping or the hallway track again, like we talk about it all
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.280]   the time. And that's what clubhouse kind of reminds me of. It reminds me of the club. I mean,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:10.720]   the hallway track at conferences, but it's just not the same sitting on the floor, crappy expensive
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:17.120]   coffee from the Marriott vendor and waiting for your keynote or brushing up on your speech or,
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.800]   you know, right? Articles really fast. Yeah. Yeah. It's just it's a thing or the chieftain
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:28.000]   having drinks at the chief thing with Ken Ray after. Yeah. No, I really agree with the effect.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.880]   That was a big loss of Mackerel Expo went away because that was for the Apple community. That was
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:38.400]   such an important thing. It was it was and when Apple, I mean, we knew it was the end when Apple
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.840]   backed out when Apple left it was dead. Yeah. Well, how can you actually? Yeah, what? Yeah. I mean,
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.560]   when you're flat. I think they would have came back though with the see. So from the time that
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.840]   Apple pulled out to the where Apple is right now, I think they would have came back and we could
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:59.920]   have held it for like two more years because that explosion in Apple, so the last macro was 2014.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:06.800]   The massive explosion in Apple sort of happened at late 14 15 maybe early 16. So I think they
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.640]   would have come back just as a hey, thank you guys. But yeah, but then they built the spaceship
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:19.840]   and now they have their own stuff. Yeah, no, Apple the last Apple Mackerel was 2009, right?
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.760]   Wow. Yes, it was. And so they didn't they left it wasn't a monetary thing. It was a they don't need
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.680]   to be there. They can have their own events thing. Like it was very much a control thing.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.840]   I remember how devastated Paul can't let me to me to because you know, and I was at that last
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.800]   Mackerel that was at it and it was you know, and I actually think that was the one that you and I
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:44.480]   met at and it might have been earlier than that. It's probably foolish of Apple because
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.360]   yeah, honestly, the community is is a big part of what makes Apple Apple.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.960]   It is. Although I think that on the flip side, I mean, I personally think that
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:00.400]   the community is a huge thing and that it was turning into a phone accessory show though, right?
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.280]   Yes. Well, that's when it became after they left, right? It wasn't that before like 2009.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.040]   It was after I left. Okay. After they left, that's because that was the only people who they could
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.040]   get as vendors, right? It's no one's just a waste of time. Who cares about the phone case? It was like
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:20.560]   exactly. I feel like for Apple, they probably look at it as like, we are now this massive company.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:26.960]   We have this massive reach. We're not this niche anymore. We don't need to be at this smaller show
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.160]   because we're everywhere, right? Like I feel like, I mean, we saw similar things with CES like
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.480]   Microsoft left CES, Intel left CES. There were a lot of big companies left CES and CES changed.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:44.160]   Microsoft was back at CES virtually this year. I don't remember what our exact involvement was,
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:50.880]   but you know, but you see this happen where companies realize you can go direct to the audience
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.600]   rather than having to be part of these other things, but you do lose that community touchstone.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.680]   And I feel like something like the Mac, that's a real shame. Apple's always had the arrogance problem.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.840]   And I feel it's gotten worse. And I think losing track of the
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:11.680]   enthusiast is part of what really hurts. And now they really think
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:20.240]   their poop doesn't stink. And I think that that's not going to be good in the long run.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.800]   I really have to agree. I mean, the way that Apple has run it, it's
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:31.760]   user and developer communities over the last few years has been really quite shameful.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.960]   It's just like, yeah, mistakes like the butterfly keyboard happen.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:40.000]   Oh, exactly. And the same with the screen problem that emerged this week as well.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.640]   Yeah, they're getting, you know, it's like, this is how it should be done,
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.320]   get used to it. You're going to have to carry around 20 dongles or whatever.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:51.360]   And it shows a contempt for users, which is really rather upsetting.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.680]   It's lately bothered me because Big Sur is a nag. Like every time I want to download something,
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.320]   it says, do you want to download from the site? Yeah, I just clicked the download link.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.400]   You can stop asking me now. But it's going to always do that from now on. That's safari.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:12.480]   There's a lot of very problematic decisions about what you can write to every time you want to write.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:19.120]   I wanted to, I tried to store my home directory on an external drive. Don't ever do that, kids,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:25.600]   because Apple just doesn't want you to do that. And so there's all sorts of roadblocks to,
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:33.120]   frankly, I was talking about this before the show, got rid of my iMac and got a PC,
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.880]   not to run Windows. I'm sorry, Christina, but I'm not.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.720]   Linux, because I feel like Linux is the last place where you can do what you want to do.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.000]   And there's there's downsides to that, I admit, but I don't, I don't want to be nannied.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.680]   I don't want to be nagged. I know what I'm doing. There's a weird catch 22, because like, I come
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.600]   from the days where we had to do stuff and part of the fun was going in terminal, you know, doing
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:01.680]   things, whatever. And I get that they made it so that I don't have to answer as many questions to
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.520]   my sisters and my mom anymore. They can just do it by themselves. But then there's certain
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.840]   things that you miss. And the same thing with the idea of over shrinking everything, right?
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.920]   Like, I'm the big dude. Like I didn't mind it when the laptop weighed a pound and a half.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:24.640]   Like I didn't need it to be the, you know, like, a point seven ounces and it's super flat and thin
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.680]   bezel made out of a single piece of aluminium, you know, like I didn't need that. And it's funny.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:34.480]   My friends and I were talking about buying the domain Mac Dongles and
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.200]   you show over one billion with a bunch of tests.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:46.560]   Yeah, because we definitely, I mean, you need a dongle for everything. And I mean, okay, get it
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:52.640]   is when you want the minimalist desk, it looks dope. But after that, it's not very productive.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.160]   Kind of what has to open the drawer to pull out the 10 gigabyte receipt,
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.200]   plucking on the damn table and then put it back later.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.360]   When I took out my I'm Mac, I had all these drives attached to it,
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.240]   which are all unfortunately formatted APFS. So I can't use them with anything else. So, you know,
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.920]   I have to reform Adam. So I'm giving him the Lisa because she's getting my I'm Mac. And I got
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.560]   rid of the I'mac because I got sick of the 27 inch screen. Now there is a rumor. And I might
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:24.320]   regret this because Apple's next I'mac, which will come out probably at WWDC in June, also a
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:33.680]   virtual conference will be a 32 inch bezel list, chinless display. But I like the idea of separating
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.720]   the computer from display. I want a different kind of display. You all are doing that. And
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   I feel like Apple is kind of where Microsoft was with the UAC. Remember the universal universe was a
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:55.120]   user access control used to be good. Yeah, invested awful nightmare. And yeah, protect me.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.280]   Okay, I get it. But I have to say it's not the worst thing invested, but that's not safe.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:06.960]   This still was like the final straw for me. I had been like a user of both. And then
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.760]   Vista was the moment where I was like, I'm never using Windows again. And it was it was like Windows
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:17.680]   10 before I was like willing to use it for more than just a virtual machine. I love the M1. I
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:22.960]   really think Apple has designed an amazing processor. But on the other hand, this AMD Ryzen,
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:29.920]   there's no slouch. No, no, it depends on what you this is a weird thing too, right? Because like
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.480]   for laptops, I think M1 is such a perfect battery life. There's nobody who can call it.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.840]   The battery life is amazing. But you know, we now have we're really moved this place even
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.320]   when things do return war to normal. We're it's going to be a while before we had the
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.440]   same ability that we did before. And so it's like we've had this desktop renaissance. And in that
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:55.360]   case, you're like, well, I kind of like having a powerful GPU, you know, and power doesn't,
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.800]   yeah, you know, performance doesn't matter quite as much. Right. So right. That's where I kind of
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.920]   that's where I ended up. Yeah. Let's take a little break. Christina Warren's here film girl from
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.600]   Microsoft, she's senior cloud advocate, host of rocket, and just a wonderful sneaker wearer in
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.320]   general. What is this sneaker behind you? What do you have there? Where's that? What is this?
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.800]   This is a Jordan one. These are good. Do you can only afford the right one or the left one? You
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:27.040]   couldn't afford both? Oh, no, I can have both. I just joined the that's really pretty. What's that
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.760]   extra thing above the Nike swoosh? There's like a little, no, no, no, I mean, they're the logo. It
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:37.760]   looks like it's a double swoosh. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is just the Jordan logo. Oh, I get it.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:44.400]   So it's a swoosh plus. Yeah. We'll talk about sneakers in a little bit. He and Thompson,
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:52.160]   it's also here the register.com. He's a man. Without a mustache. I haven't seen.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:57.120]   I know. I started off at last. It was a blessing to get rid of the damn thing. It was.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.000]   I like the big smug of a. We missed you. I'm sorry. I'm glad you're back.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.560]   Oh, yes. Yeah. It's been a bit of a while. And is your wife happy to?
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:14.000]   Yeah. Well, she got vaccinated early because she's in the central care worker. Nice.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.240]   Yeah. We're now. Good life is coming back. Getting back to know. Yeah. I'm very excited about that.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.680]   And also Doc Rock, who is in Hawaii, where he has been quarantined for the last 19 months.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.840]   That's about right. The people we're going to get back to normal. My friends will tell you,
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.840]   I've never been normal. So I'm pretty squirky.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.200]   It's offices in the basement. That's okay. Brand ambassador for E cam. We'll ask you about that
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:47.040]   too. I better. Yeah. Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter. I am. So if you're a business
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.800]   owner and you're hiring, I am. Thank you. Thank you. We're coming back. Thank you. But you know,
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:58.960]   it's funny. You probably forgot what a pain in the butt hiring is. All those phone calls,
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.600]   sifting through all those resumes. And then you always feel like, I know the right person is
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.520]   out there. But how do I reach them? That's why you got it. You got to try Zip Recruiter.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:14.880]   Zip Recruiter immediately posts. It's it's it posts to 100 plus job boards with one post with one
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:20.160]   click of the mouse. So right there, you know, it's not a needle in the haystack. You got there's
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.280]   there's a lot of needles out there and the haystack's a lot smaller. Not enough applicants with the
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:31.120]   right skills or experience. Oh, trust me, they're out there. Too many resumes to sort through.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:37.200]   Don't worry. Zip Recruiter doesn't send them all into your mailbox or your phone. It it handles
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.240]   it all in the Zip Recruiter interface. They even reformat the resumes so you can scan them quickly.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:49.840]   Not knowing where the person who's looking for work is. Don't worry. There. Zip Recruiter reaches
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:55.520]   them all. Hiring feels like trying to find an needle in a haystack. But Zip Recruiter comes
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.240]   through. In fact, one of the things they do, they have matching technology. When you post that job,
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:05.520]   they immediately go out and look at those resumes and find the people who fit your needs

[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.160]   used your recruiter multiple times. It only took us usually an hour or two before the qualified
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.600]   candidate started rolling in. That's probably why 2.3 million businesses go to Zip Recruiter for
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:34.320]   their hiring needs. Other companies may overwhelm you with too many options. Doing it yourself
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:40.240]   will definitely overwhelm you with too many applicants. Zip Recruiter helps you find the

[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.920]   One other happy Microsoft story. I'm sure you're jumping up and down with this one.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:21.280]   The Jedi contract may be up again for grabs, but Microsoft just got a big contract with the US Army
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:36.800]   for 120,000 plus HoloLens units, a contract worth $22 billion. Wow. Do you know what the
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:42.400]   Army is going to use? Yeah, that's huge. I have no concept. They don't tell me anything.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:50.960]   There's a picture of a soldier wearing a HoloLens. It's a special Army HoloLens.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:57.600]   I know that the HoloLens has been really successful in industry. It's one of those products that I
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.760]   think, especially the way that was originally introduced. And I was at the original launch.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:07.200]   I remember talking to people on that team that was very much made to be like, "Oh, this is going to be
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.760]   a consumer thing." And then obviously never was. Some of the mixed reality headsets have had more
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:17.760]   of a consumer appeal, but never hasn't really taken off that way. But it's been very successful
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.400]   in industries. And we've seen it in construction. We've seen it in logistics and other stuff.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.520]   I guess it makes sense that the Army would want to do something with it, but they don't tell me
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.600]   anything. They're smart enough to not tell me something. Let me read the Army's statement,
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:37.680]   because they're a little more forthcoming. They say the equipment is made up of high resolution.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:45.040]   It's not your Papa's HoloLens. It's made up of high resolution night, thermal, and soldier-borne
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.000]   sensors integrated into a unified heads-up display. I mean, you could think, if this thing is robust,
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:57.920]   this would be. And they plan to use it both for training, but also in combat, so that close
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.760]   combat force personnel can rehearse before engaging any adversaries. So it'll help you fight as well
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:09.840]   as train. And we've seen pictures of combat personnel wearing night vision goggles and things
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:17.840]   like that. If this thing is robust and reliable, huge benefit, I would imagine. I mean, maps,
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.680]   situational awareness, thermal imaging, it would be incredible.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:32.480]   If you look at the British Army's perspective, the ideal time to launch an attack is about
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:37.600]   4.30 in the morning, because it's dark. You've got night vision. They don't. And you can get
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:45.040]   after it. I gave a, in fact, I gave Twitter a very excitable interview after trying the first
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:51.040]   HoloLens back when it was launched. It was just like, this is brilliant. And it really is. If they've
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:57.920]   got it into a usable AR format, Microsoft could actually steal a march on this. Google tried it,
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:03.840]   failed. Oculus tried it, has failed. Maybe it's Microsoft's turn.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.760]   If you think about it, though, Augmented is got, that's the way to go. You don't, I mean,
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.880]   last thing I was going to combat and not be able to see where I'm going.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.320]   Great. Absolutely.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:17.920]   So Augmented, as the president, soldier here, here's what's going to, what I think is going to be
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:24.000]   dope. And I think every time these stories come up, you served in Iraq, I forgot. Yeah, you're the
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:31.120]   expert. Well, Kuwait, but same thing. Okay. The idea, the guys that are entering the service now
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:39.200]   grew up playing games like Halo, where this was part of the deal. So bringing their
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:45.840]   most training that they probably had more than anything else, some of us are still doing it,
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.800]   right? Being able to bring that environment to a soldier is going to make them better,
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.040]   because you don't even, you won't have to spend a lot of time training that because a lot of the
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:01.040]   people have been training that for many, many years already in. So being able to know that,
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:06.240]   you know, my friends are on my six, they're okay. Know who has how much rounds they have left
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:11.200]   because of telemetry in their weaponry. I can be like, okay, this guy only has four rounds.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.680]   Look, I want you to fall back and watch the back. This guy still has a full clip. I want you to
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.400]   come with a link. I want you to cover flank. You know what I mean? So like, I can take inventory,
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.800]   I could check on my guys, I can see my stats, I can look back and I can be like, look,
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:29.120]   port your heart rate is up. What's going on? You're good. And you're like, yeah, yeah, I'm good.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.200]   Just a little nervous. Okay, look, if you're nervous, I want you to pull middle and just watch
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:39.120]   Ariel, right? And I'll get somebody that's a little bit more situated to cover point, right? You know,
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:44.400]   I'm saying other than guys lying and saying, no, I'm good, I'm good. And then not really able to
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.840]   do what they need to do. Right. So as a sergeant and I'm running my platoon, if I got all of their
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.760]   data running by on the screen, I can make way better decisions. And it's okay, because a lot of
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:00.880]   guys until they see their contact, they're nervous. Once they see their contact, they drop in,
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:06.480]   they're settled. They're, you know, what we call fit to fight, right? So I would love to be able
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:11.680]   to see all of that or even as a medic, like to get an alert from some situational thing on my
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:17.280]   head to tell me that, you know, someone's down, I can get to them quicker. Do you like, there's so
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.120]   much I could do with this. Since you really have the perspective on this, which I'm so glad you're
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:29.520]   here. Does it sometimes though, could you get too dependent on tech? I mean, especially in desert
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.520]   common instincts or instinct seriously, you know, I get that. And that's a very common
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:38.080]   conversation about everything that we do. And I still say no, because at the end of the day,
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.480]   we're still humans and our instincts are instincts like I am a trained paramedic. Like if you were
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.880]   to have a conduction fit right now, you know what to do, you could reach out through the TV.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:52.800]   Through the zoom and get you square away. No, I just if it's real, if it's reliable.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:59.280]   Yeah, you know, I remember in Vietnam, I was lucky enough not to have to serve my draft numbers
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:04.640]   very high. But a lot of my friends, and we certainly heard about the news, those M16s with jam.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:10.320]   And there's nothing worse. You're in a firefight, your gun is jammed. I worry, and these are much
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:17.120]   more high tech devices. But I guess you would train to both have them and not have them. Absolutely.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.840]   Yeah, you retrain for all contingencies. Like we've been trained for what to do when there's no sound
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.400]   radio silence. So in all the games, or every movie, they make it a point to show you the
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.040]   hand signals. Those exist because there's times where you have to go radio silence.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:37.600]   That's right. That's right. The reason why nightvage and goggles was such a boom is because before
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:42.400]   what we would do is throw illumination grenade in the air, which has a small parachute. It comes
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:47.040]   down and turns the lights on for a second. We can do what we need to do. Sometimes we just throw it,
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:51.840]   take a look. Okay, we know where everything is and then go when it gets dark again. So there's
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:59.280]   that you always train for both aspects of it. So yeah, and this is the same with the Navy as
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:05.760]   well as the sailor. I have to say, the US Navy still trains officers to use sex. We have GPS.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.680]   We have all this. We have Laura and we have the rest of it. But you still need to be able to use
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:18.400]   the sex because if it goes down, it really goes down. Excellent point. Excellent point.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.000]   And by the way, Chris Williams had this story in the register. And one of the things he
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.760]   mentioned, certainly it is controversial. It's been controversial at Microsoft,
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.320]   even more so at Google doing defense contract work. But I would hope,
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:37.600]   I mean, this used to be the patriotic duty of American corporations. Ford started making tanks
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:43.680]   during World War II to support our troops. I would hope that this would be a non-controversial
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:49.440]   technology. Have you heard anything in Microsoft about people saying, "Oh, we don't want to be
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:54.800]   making this for the Army?" I don't know. I mean, I don't know that there was disagreement or,
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:01.200]   there was not everyone loved the Jedi contract. I'm sure that there are people who are uncomfortable
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:06.240]   with this as they would be with any sort of big contract that Microsoft has with any
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:14.160]   corporation or government group, right? Well, this is twice the size of the Jedi.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.480]   No, I know. I'm just saying there are 156,000 employees. So I'm sure that there are some people
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:22.800]   who are happy. There are some people who are unhappy, right? I guess if you're a pacifist.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:28.880]   Brad Smith, Microsoft president, wrote, "We believe in the strong defense of the United States,
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.880]   and we want the people who defend it to have access to the nation's best technology,
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.520]   including from Microsoft." I think that kind of says it all. And that's, I think, completely
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:42.560]   appropriate. It's cool. My only concern would be, I don't think of the hollow lens as being
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:48.000]   rugged. Right. Well, it looks like they've adapted the bat.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.240]   It seems that they've said, right? And I'm sure that with the size of the contract,
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:57.520]   they'll do more R&D on that. I know completely different use case, obviously, but I do know
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.480]   that they created hard hat versions of the hollow lens for construction sites that worked really
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:08.560]   well. So they can adapt it, obviously, and they'll need to do more than that for people who are in
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.760]   different conditions where you might be using this on missions. It actually really makes you think,
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:21.280]   I think this is really good for Microsoft, because it also makes you think of how useful the hollow
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.840]   lens would be in a variety of circumstances, not just for being. I can see pilots wearing these.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.440]   No, totally. I mean, this is really... I was thinking firefighters, actually,
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:35.440]   when you're talking... I think firefighters would be amazing. I interviewed a New York City
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:42.720]   battalion chief and got to know about what their process is for fighting fires. And
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:48.240]   so much of it is it's all information-based. And they certainly don't want to rely on technology
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:53.920]   because they have to do what's there in the field, but they can be aided by it. But you think
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:53:00.480]   about having thermal imaging and having access to maybe a map of what a location might look like,
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:06.800]   or direct communications, or oxygen levels, or other things. It can be really, really useful
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:12.560]   for firefighters. Obviously, they can't rely exclusively on that stuff. They still have to use
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.480]   their own instincts, their own knowledge. But having that, I think, would be fantastic.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:23.040]   And there are all kinds of situations where if you have to adapt something like that to work in
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:31.120]   certain weather conditions and in certain lower-powered conditions where you might have access to a
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:37.600]   power supplier or whatever, where you could really open up how this could be used absent of looking
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:42.320]   at it in a military context. And I might have... I can understand how somebody
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.840]   working at Dow, chemical, might have had problems with napalm, but this is not that kind of a technology.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:55.520]   This is a technology that will save lives. And look, it's not a peaceful world. And sometimes the
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:02.800]   best path to peace is a strong defense as well. So I think this seems like a very good thing all
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:09.040]   round for Microsoft, for the Army, and for future uses of the HoloLens. I'm glad to hear about it.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:15.360]   Anyway, it would be nice if you could put Cortana in your earpiece, and she could say,
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.320]   you know, I don't know. I just like when I play Halo, I expect a little help.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:27.520]   Donnie Moore, Cortana's gone. I was gonna say didn't we just kill Cortana?
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.200]   Yeah, and I love...
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:36.080]   I killed on iOS and Android this week. It was killed on the last remaining smart speaker last week.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.360]   Which I have.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:38.160]   Cortana now.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:38.880]   Which I have.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.160]   Yes, the Harmon Carmen.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:44.080]   I have the Harmon Carden in Vogue. It's now a fine Bluetooth speaker.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:48.160]   A very expensive dumb Bluetooth speaker.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:55.600]   I love your writer, Katie, and I watch his headline in a devastating blow to all eight of you.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.960]   Microsoft pulls the plug on, or does Android.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.600]   Okay, we have a call with it. What can I say?
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.680]   You're famous. You're famous for your snark.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.800]   You are. The Red El Red has the best headlines.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.160]   Absolutely. And I think probably it was about eight people that bought the Harmon Carden in Vogue.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.480]   But Cortana was on Windows too. It's still in Windows, right?
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.120]   It's been deprecated.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:19.440]   You can submit it.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.400]   Right. I'm sorry.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:20.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:20.960]   I'm sending it.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.160]   It's the first thing I turn off, by the way, when I set up Windows.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:24.960]   I don't use it.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:25.600]   I turn it.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.720]   You know, I don't use Siri on Mac either.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.720]   It's just like a voice assistant on a computer.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.000]   It's not the same as a voice assistant on a device or a phone.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.120]   It's just not that useful.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:44.000]   So I just find voice assistants very bad at proper names, company names,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.880]   the whole thing.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.480]   I'd rather just type it in.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.720]   And I really don't want the phone or device listening in on me at any time,
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.360]   anyway. So yeah, get it done.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.120]   Be writing the old fashioned way.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.240]   Hey, I love hitting that Windows key type in the first few letters.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.240]   That's all I need. I don't need more than that.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.760]   That's that's plenty.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.720]   Cortana content you created will no longer function.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:09.360]   Such as reminders and lists will no longer function in the mobile app,
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:14.640]   but you know, get a desktop because you could still get to it in Cortana on Windows.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:19.760]   And I guess the to do app is going to automatically pick up where you left off.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.800]   So get the to do app.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:27.440]   And there have been bridges, I believe, for years where you could kind of port like Cortana stuff
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.000]   and into Alexa and some of the other assistants.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.560]   So what does this mean for voice assistants?
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.320]   I mean, Microsoft's essentially saying we're not going to be in the voice assistant business, right?
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.280]   I mean, I think that you basically you have your big two, right?
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.920]   Like you have Amazon and then I guess you have, you know,
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.240]   Google and Amazon, even even Amazon, even, you know,
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.760]   no, Apple exists in the Apple world, right?
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.640]   But who uses a home pod?
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.040]   No one.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:53.440]   Right.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.640]   I think that they actually just continue the big home pod.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:00.960]   But I think as they should have at a home, many is the right price,
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.000]   right product, right?
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.600]   The original massive mistake of my part, and I'm still angry that I spent $350 on it.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.560]   But regardless, yeah, but I mean, no.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.480]   Hey, I bought Sonos.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.040]   I bought a lot of Sonos because I do too.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   I do too.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:15.600]   You got nothing.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.560]   I thought I know I like my Sonos.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.960]   My Sonos has a good way to support everything.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.240]   Sonos is great.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.880]   I got two Sonos once, the same price as the home pod,
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.600]   which is why I was so mad at the home pod.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.200]   Anyway, yeah, I don't know.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.560]   I feel like even if you, and I'm a fairly die-hard Apple user,
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.960]   and I don't use Siri.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.320]   I mean, like for anything other than setting alarms,
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.760]   and I do like it on Apple TV.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:44.560]   So I feel like everything's kind of codified on Amazon and Google.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:45.280]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:45.920]   I don't know.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.720]   What do you think it is?
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:49.520]   It's just the full Siri, like one cousin, right?
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:54.720]   Everybody has that one cousin, and you defend them because well,
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:58.000]   you have to because grandma's saying, yeah, because they're family.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.760]   The thing to me, the reason why Siri will always be last place in poor Siri
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:11.360]   is because it was originally set up knowing that there was going to be a screen.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:14.240]   Oh, that there was going to be a screen, right?
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:14.960]   Right.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.440]   And the other guys came after the fact.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.480]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.120]   So Apple fought Siri and was going to have a screen.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:21.760]   Always.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.320]   Oh.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:22.320]   Right.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.720]   And so the other guys came up with no screen,
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.400]   no care for your privacy, and they just got better really quickly.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:31.040]   And then they were able to work from there, right?
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.760]   But initially, Siri always know, hey, okay, here's the answer.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.560]   Look at it.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:38.400]   So the most frustrating things about Siri is here's the answer.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.040]   Look at it.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.160]   And I'm like, woman, if I could look at it, I wouldn't ask you.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.680]   You know, I got my hands covered in my dough, or, you know,
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.800]   something that I'm doing.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.480]   My hands are covered in dough.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.600]   I'm like, yeah, can you convert, you know, how many tablespoons to whatever,
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.680]   you know, the Japanese measurement is.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.120]   And she's like, okay, look.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.080]   And I'm like, not look.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:58.800]   You're over there.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.520]   I got them right here.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.040]   I hate it when they do that.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.080]   So that's why.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:07.040]   And so whereas the A lady or, you know, the okay frugal,
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.880]   will just speak it out because they were always speaker born.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:10.960]   Right.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.720]   And so that's a good point.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.840]   Defense for Siri.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.000]   But she's still kind of little stupid.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.760]   She's a little slow.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.840]   She's a sweetie, but she's slow.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:23.120]   By the way, apparently Siri is no longer having a default
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.000]   female voice.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.240]   Yeah, which is cool.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:31.760]   In North America, in other countries, I think like in the UK and in other places,
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.640]   it had already defaulted to a male voice.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:40.880]   But if you're setting up a new device, this is going to be part of what the next iOS version
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.080]   is, as far as I know.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.280]   Yeah, it's in the data right now.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.800]   Then if you're setting up a new device, it's going to, I guess, be randomized,
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.520]   but it's not going to automatically default to the classic female voice.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.960]   They also added two new voices.
[00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:00.080]   Do you think there's a market for celebrity, you know,
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.360]   celebrities to do this?
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.680]   I would just love, you know.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.160]   She's massive.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.280]   Oh, and the thing is, it's not a real, it's not a real, Tom, Tom.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:14.240]   My Tom, Tom GPS, 15 years ago, I had Christopher Walken.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.880]   It had Dennis Hopper was weird.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.480]   He would say, you know, you'd get it.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.400]   He said, right, right, right, right.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:22.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.920]   You've arrived, man.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.480]   You've arrived.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.200]   You're here.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.760]   I don't know why anybody would want to go here.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.160]   It was very weird, but it was great.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.120]   And then, and then remember, I don't know if you remember this, but the, the,
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:40.160]   uh, GLADOS, the evil robot in the portal game, I had a Tom, Tom GLADOS voice.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.760]   And she would always say turn left when you were supposed to go right.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.160]   She would give you the intention.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.680]   Oh my God.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:48.800]   Nightmare.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.440]   It wasn't good.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:49.920]   I mean, that's amazing.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.280]   It's hilarious, but that's also.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:51.920]   It wasn't good.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.680]   No, that's the dumbest thing to do in a Tom, Tom.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.320]   It's the spherical and I like love the trouble.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.440]   That's also objectively the dumbest possible thing to do.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:01.520]   It's dangerous.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.400]   You could go off a cliff.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.120]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.680]   You, you, you give people killed.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.520]   But I'm laughing because it makes me think of the office episode when Michael drives into the lake.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.520]   Because his, because because because the GPS told him to.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.240]   GPS told him to.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.920]   You know what that maybe then was funny today.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.960]   It's true.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:24.400]   You know what I would just love to have Sam Jackson as my series.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:24.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.680]   We're talking about anything in the shot.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.960]   Googles did that.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.400]   Googles didn't do.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:30.880]   Yes.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.920]   Googles did voice.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.360]   They had a couple of good voices.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.200]   Oh, Sam was in ways, wasn't it?
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.280]   Oh, maybe it was ways.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.480]   Ways you could get anybody.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.000]   I made voice for ways.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.720]   Anybody could do a voice for ways.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.600]   I think probably still can.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.200]   Here are the new Siri American voices.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.080]   Courtesy of John Gruber voice one and four of these.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.040]   Oh, let's say the first one.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.400]   This is bound to be terrible.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:57.600]   I use the, I think I use the Irish one on my series.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.480]   I use the Irish one.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.040]   I like it.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:01:59.840]   It's kind of funny.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.520]   I like it too.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.320]   Here we go.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.200]   Siri voices.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.680]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.360]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.400]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.000]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.640]   Hi, I'm Siri.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.160]   Choose the voice you'd like me to use.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.480]   Okay, so those last two, obviously, those are the new ones.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.000]   Younger, right?
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:22.480]   Younger.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:22.880]   Younger.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.440]   Yes.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.400]   Hipper, right?
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.240]   I would be curious to see how they're going to do the British
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.360]   and South African ones because honestly having suffered
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.720]   through Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins, then Americans
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   doing British accents never eligible.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.360]   Hello Mary.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.920]   I use the South Africa.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.240]   I also use the South African Siri.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.600]   I really love, for some reason,
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.200]   there's something about the South African accent
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.040]   because it's not really, it's Boer.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.160]   It's Dutch a little bit, I guess, but it's a wonderfully odd accent.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.680]   It's very harsh sounding though.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.640]   You don't get that many South African love poets, you know?
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.600]   It's like, how the African love poets?
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.840]   Well, I wouldn't say not necessarily so.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.400]   I don't know.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:10.080]   There's some really good, funny parodies on YouTube about Black Siri.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.360]   I think that would be fun.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.560]   Here's the...
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.520]   Here's the...
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.520]   Let me see if I can find the South African voice.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.040]   This is probably going to have a lot of...
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.720]   You know, this is a problem with YouTubers.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.640]   Yeah, he's going to go on and on and on.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.320]   He's going to talk for five minutes.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.760]   And then at the very end of the video,
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.640]   he's going to play the voice.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.000]   So I'm just not going to do it.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.400]   But I like the South African Siri.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:30.800]   Try it.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.440]   And I might use...
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.000]   I don't know.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.160]   What I really want a young person telling me directions.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.760]   He should have an old person for people like me.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.120]   It's been crushing me.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:43.520]   I don't get the entire...
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:43.760]   I don't get the entire person.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.960]   I'm going to go here.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.760]   Go here.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.080]   Come on.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:46.720]   No.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.360]   What are you doing?
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.080]   Over there.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:48.880]   Where are you going?
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.840]   I like the idea of Brian Blasted doing it.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.360]   He's just like, "Don't write!
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.400]   Don't write!
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.440]   I'm holding some life!"
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.720]   I want to be yelled at.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.960]   I want to be like, like, like...
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.080]   What are you doing?
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.360]   I asked Siri a question.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.320]   This is what it is.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.600]   The idiot?
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:06.880]   That's snarky.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.360]   Snarky.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.840]   Siri gives as good as she gets.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.880]   Is that what you're looking for?
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.800]   That's exactly what I'm looking for.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.680]   I mean, this was the most fun thing when Siri first came out as you would ask her.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.080]   He's dumb questions, like, who let the dogs out?
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.400]   And then apparently the record label sued over that.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:20.960]   You're kidding.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.760]   They have to approve the answer.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.560]   I'm not kidding.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.120]   I'm not kidding.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.080]   I'm going to be kidding.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.160]   Because she would respond, "Who? Who? Who?"
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.920]   Which is hysterical and great.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.280]   And then, yeah.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:29.760]   Apparently...
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.240]   If you're an old anybody who says, "Who, who, who?"
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:32.800]   We all got...
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.560]   They were, I guess they were like,
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.840]   "Yeah, the one hit wonder..."
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.440]   Who were they, Baja Boys?
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.600]   They were like, "Yeah, we need that money."
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.000]   And I'm like, "Really? Really?"
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:46.240]   You should be happy that we all remember the novelty song from 1999.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.480]   You want the drill sergeant from Platoon.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.280]   That's who you want.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.000]   There you go.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.120]   Oh no, you want these drill sergeant from Aliens?
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:55.520]   Oh yeah.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.480]   Baja Men.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.840]   Baja Men, that's who it was.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.160]   Monday, morning news meetings with...
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.240]   Every day, it's a beautiful day in the Corps.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.760]   Every meal is a banquet.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.320]   Every day.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.640]   It's like, "I love that opening speech."
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.560]   And it's a great way to get people going.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.600]   Let's take a little break.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.960]   We got more to talk about.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.920]   Of course, with these guys,
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.960]   it's just, you know, whatever you want to talk about,
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.840]   they're always the best.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:19.120]   Great to have Doc Rock, Ian Thompson,
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.640]   Christina Warren, our show today brought to you by Express.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.360]   V-P-N.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.680]   I, you know, this is a sponsor that is near and dear to all of our listeners' hearts,
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.480]   I think, because you, more than anybody,
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   I know care about privacy.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:39.680]   And thanks to the internet, that's privacy is tough.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.920]   Everything you browse for,
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.840]   everything you search for, you watch your tweet is just known.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.720]   You might want to keep some of that your own business,
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.320]   but in the year where everyone's online,
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.560]   you know, it's not automatic.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.480]   Your internet service provider can see what you're doing.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.400]   They often log it and sell it.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.880]   If you want to be protected, you need Express V-P-N.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.880]   That's what I used to keep my data private.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.000]   Now, you might see, well, wouldn't any VPN work new?
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   Because the VPN now is getting all that data,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.400]   you're depriving Google and your internet service provider of.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.960]   And many VPNs, especially the cheap and free ones,
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.240]   will do the same thing.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.880]   They'll sell it, not Express VPN.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.400]   They guarantee no logging.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.080]   They're absolutely private.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.240]   In fact, they go the extra mile to prove it.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.920]   First of all, they have regular audits
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.200]   by an independent third party price water house Cooper.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.320]   Aren't those the same people that add the Academy Award balance?
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.600]   I think so. You can trust them.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.160]   They have not only audited the Express V-P-N privacy policy and said,
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:40.400]   "Yep."
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.600]   They have audited their trusted server technology,
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.120]   which I think is really cool.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.520]   This is a company that's so committed to your privacy.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.920]   They modified their way the VPN server works.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.200]   So it runs only in memory.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:55.120]   When you press the big button on the Express V-P-N app to go online,
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.080]   you're spinning up whatever server you choose,
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.400]   you're spinning up that trusted server technology,
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.480]   runs and RAM in a sandbox.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.080]   It can't write to disk.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:07.200]   No matter what, it cannot keep track of anything you're doing.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.600]   And then when you exit, it's gone.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.920]   Add a memory out of sight.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.560]   Add a mind.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.120]   It's gone.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.240]   There is no record.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.640]   That's the kind of VPN you want.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.040]   Data harvesters will use your IP address
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.120]   like every time you do a Google search.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.480]   They know exactly where it comes from.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.880]   They see your IP address unless you're using Express V-P-N.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.920]   Then they think, well, we don't know who he is.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.000]   Or she is because that's a VPN.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.320]   With Express V-P-N, all of your data is routed through an encrypted server,
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.160]   which means your IP address is masked.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:42.960]   You're given a random IP address shared by other Express V-P-N customers.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.480]   So third parties really don't know who you are.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.280]   And it's easy to use Express V-P-N because it runs everywhere.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.120]   Even your smart TV.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.800]   Iphone, great apps on the iPhone and Android device.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.320]   Very easy to use.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.840]   Laptop, desktop.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.800]   You can even put Express V-P-N on your router in many cases,
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.600]   which means the whole house is protected.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.560]   Just tap one button.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.080]   You're safe.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.840]   That's why I choose Express V-P-N.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.400]   I'm not alone.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.800]   It's the number one VPN rated that way by wired, by CNET.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.920]   I've been using it for a long time now.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.880]   And it's fast enough to watch HD video anywhere in the world.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.080]   And I think that's really important.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:24.400]   So if you're like me and you believe your data is your business,
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.680]   secure yourself with the number one rated VPN on the market.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.800]   It's the only one I recommend.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.680]   The only one I use Express V-P-N.com/twit.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.080]   You'll get three extra months free with a one year package.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.880]   See why wired CNET and others have picked Express V-P-N as the best.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.000]   E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N.com/twit.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.640]   Get the number one trusted VPN, expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.600]   We thank them so much for their support of this week.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:54.880]   And tech.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.520]   See, good.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.520]   I'm glad she didn't have to pee in a bottle.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.400]   She got up.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.520]   She was responsible.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.840]   She got what'd you get a beer?
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   Oh, Dr. Pepper.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.640]   Dr. Pepper.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.200]   Dr. Pepper.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.000]   Even better.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   Oh, the beer.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:10.720]   Foul stuff.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.920]   Is it prune juice?
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.120]   It tastes like prune juice.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.200]   Doesn't it?
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.160]   No.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.800]   Is it what flavor is Dr. Pepper?
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.920]   I don't know.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.400]   It's...
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.760]   It's Dr. Pepper.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.880]   It's not prune juice.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.080]   It tastes like...
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.320]   Tastes like prune juice.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.040]   I always thought...
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.320]   Lisa drinks it too.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.520]   Oh, it's kind of a cherry flavor.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:31.680]   I don't know.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.000]   Cherry.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:32.640]   Maybe that's what it is.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.280]   It's a good flavor.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:33.760]   Maybe it's cherry.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.720]   I hate diet soda, but I can't drink regular soda anymore.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.000]   No more sugar for you.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.200]   Well, no, I have too much sugar in my diet, but...
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.600]   So, and now when I drink regular soda,
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.160]   it's just too sweet.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:46.960]   I can't do it.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.200]   Okay.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.400]   So the only soda that doesn't make me like hate myself is diet.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:52.880]   Dr. Pepper.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.360]   So I usually drink Le Croix, but I'm going to drink something happy.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:58.640]   I almost thought it might be either Le Croix or Topo Chico.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.880]   I thought you're that kind of hipster.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.360]   I knew it.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.160]   Of course I am.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.200]   Of course I'm not kind of hipster.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:03.280]   Of course you are.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:03.840]   We know this.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.320]   Of course you are.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.920]   So who doesn't have a clubhouse clone now?
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.080]   Let's count the ways.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.520]   Twitter's got one, right?
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.320]   Facebook's got one.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:16.880]   Ah, let's say...
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.400]   Mark Cuban's got one.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.360]   We'll be talking on the bandwagon.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.720]   Discord's got one.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.560]   Discord just announced backstage.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.840]   Spotify bought locker rooms, so they're going to have...
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.480]   I guess really the only clubhouse is no longer the unique.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.000]   Why is it?
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.160]   No.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.400]   What's so good about it?
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.000]   Maybe it's because it's a feature and not a thing.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.600]   I mean, it's kind of like Snapchat stories, right?
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.360]   Like everybody has moved on from cloning.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.120]   I think Aaron Lovey of Bach said this.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.160]   He was like, you know, all the engineers who are making stories clones
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.840]   can now move into making clubhouse clones.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.920]   And I was like, oh yeah, that's completely correct.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.360]   It's like no social media platform is complete unless it looks like
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.880]   every other social media platform.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.600]   Right.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:53.840]   Right.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.960]   We all need the same thing.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.480]   And that's the part that kills it.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.720]   But you know, it's funny is we had Vauxir back in the day.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.920]   It's nothing new, is it?
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.880]   I mean, the Vauxir was just pushed to talk.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.800]   I mean, it's kind of a little bit different, but...
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.840]   Yeah, this is different.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.800]   That was, you know, ground zero for, you know,
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.160]   the last couple conferences was here on Vauxir and kitchen, everyone.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.360]   So you were talking about, um, was a talk shoe.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.800]   Talk shoe, yeah.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.600]   Talk shoe.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.640]   That's basically what talk shoe was, right?
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.240]   Yeah, this is more ephemeral.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.200]   I mean, I think that that's one of the big things that's different about it
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.480]   is the ephemeral nature.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.560]   Yeah, we use talk shoe to make a podcast so that people could download it
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.440]   and listen forever.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.760]   And that's the case with a lot of them.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.720]   And I feel like, and I don't know how the different clones are going to work,
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.960]   I feel like though that's the sticky thing with clubhouse.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.480]   I think if you add recording into it, which just makes it a podcast,
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.520]   that ruins it.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:52.720]   Like the appeal, at least for me, and I've been using it since March or April,
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.800]   last year, is the...
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.920]   And I don't use it all the time.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.720]   I can't live on it.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.960]   Some people who live on it, I don't know how they can do that.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.240]   But the appeal for me is like, if you miss it, you miss it.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.800]   But if you're there, you're actually part of something that's organic and ephemeral.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.880]   And I feel like that's unique that you don't have with some of those other things.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.720]   Are Twitter spaces ephemeral?
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.280]   Or do they...
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.240]   No, they're far off the aisle.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:16.800]   They are.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.280]   They might be...
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.640]   I've read conflicting things about what features they might be adding,
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.200]   but I don't know.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.480]   But for right now, they are ephemeral.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.040]   And I feel like that does kind of make it special.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.280]   You have to be there a lot if you have to experience it.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.960]   Slack is adding it.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.120]   It's going to be a giant stop.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.880]   I feel like we're going to talk to you backwards on this.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.240]   Yeah, yes.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.600]   I mean, it reminds me of the old days.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:45.360]   I was explaining to a mate's young kid about how VCRs worked.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.840]   It's like, it must have been interesting.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:52.800]   You had to record a certain TV shows or discussion shows
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.680]   were only shown at a certain time of the week and you had to be there.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.560]   And if you didn't record it, that was it.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.680]   You lost down the thing.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.200]   We called it time shifting.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.720]   Yes, yes.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.200]   And then the Tivo was the amazing thing because you could then like
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.400]   tap everything at once.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.640]   And it says the 12 year old.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.320]   You mean you had to wait to watch the Wizard of Oz once a year?
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.680]   Exactly.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.720]   What?
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.480]   How primitive is that?
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.600]   There's something weird being whole about it.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.560]   Yeah, I think there was something because it made it special, right?
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.640]   Now I have Wizard of Oz, but I don't ever watch it.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.520]   Well, I was going to say it's the whole fallacy of choice concepts, right?
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.280]   We're in the paradox of choice concept, right?
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.120]   Like when you have access to everything,
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.440]   it becomes really difficult to make any decision.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.040]   And then this discovery has been the, I believe,
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.680]   one of the primary, like, just problems that have been facing.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.880]   It's all too easy now.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.840]   It's all too easy.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.280]   Because you have access to it all.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.560]   You need curation.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.160]   You need a good discovery experience.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:52.560]   And so...
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.800]   That's kind of the problem with clubhouse, right?
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.560]   I was going to say clubhouse is running on that too,
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.640]   because there are now so many rooms and so many people and so many things.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.440]   This is, I think, what TikTok is brilliant at is that they're...
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.320]   They're algorithm.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:06.960]   They're discovery.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.600]   Yes.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.120]   For discovery, it's just bananas.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:09.760]   It's so good.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.320]   You never feel like when you use TikTok, there's millions of videos.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.120]   How do I walk?
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.120]   I mean, you go to YouTube, it's overwhelmed.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.800]   It's like, I know there's millions of videos.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.440]   I don't know.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.440]   But even with a recommendation, it's...
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.840]   But with TikTok, it's a linear stream.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:22.640]   It's like Twitter.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.840]   It's just a linear stream.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.080]   They're really good at giving you what you want.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:26.880]   Now, I will say...
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.360]   Exactly.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.160]   Recently, YouTube has been adjusting their algorithm.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.000]   So I've been finding some gems,
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.280]   which I never would have searched for.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:33.680]   Oh, good.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.880]   Just popped up in my feed.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.920]   Well, that's good.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:41.920]   And I'm currently addicted to a show by four friends who just started hiking everywhere
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.840]   and it's called Adventure Archives.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.240]   And it was a random bump up in my feed.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.360]   And it's incredible.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.720]   And then there's really something cool,
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.160]   which you would probably dig, Leo.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.600]   This dude bought a ghost town.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.120]   I saw that.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.320]   Oh my goodness.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.440]   Fixing up.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.200]   That's better than regular TV.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.440]   Like, it reminds me of a discovery show
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.320]   before they started getting into all the shows in Alaska.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.920]   Of course.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.840]   For some reason, when I go to YouTube,
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.600]   my homepage on YouTube is blank.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.880]   Apparently, there's nothing I would enjoy.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.240]   So they just said, "Forget it."
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.640]   But if I hit explore, it's going to give me some choices that I will probably...
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.480]   That's really... I've never seen the homepage blank.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.600]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.360]   Oh, you're a previous.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.080]   That's crazy.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.640]   Yeah, I pay for it so I don't get those ads, right?
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.640]   Of course, I'm holding off on that
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.280]   because I'm sharing bloody mindedness.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:29.920]   Because I can...
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.520]   Let me ask you.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.560]   You get a lot of ads because people are telling me...
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.080]   Because I don't know because I'm a premium on it.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.080]   Do you get ads all the time as you're wanting?
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.520]   No, you get bombarded.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.400]   That's what I thought.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:40.800]   People are...
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.480]   I've been premium for the day one.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:42.960]   I've paid for some years.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.880]   I would never go back.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.120]   I was a great father then when it was called Music Key or something.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:49.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.400]   I bought that.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.240]   So I was like, "I'm never getting rid of that
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.280]   because it's like $8 a month.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.920]   I'm like, I'm never getting rid of this because it's
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.720]   grandfathered in.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.440]   So I have no concept of what ads on YouTube are like."
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:15:59.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.280]   There's a new space jam.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.440]   I mean, yeah.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.680]   Seriously, I don't know what's something I'm using.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.760]   There's a new space jam.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.920]   Forget all the other news.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.680]   Is that LeBron James?
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.440]   Okay.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.160]   I'm just kidding.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.840]   I knew there was a new space jam.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.080]   The website unfortunately is not as good as the original space jam website.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:20.560]   Oh really?
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.000]   Was the original something special?
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.840]   Oh yeah, it's still up.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.960]   Where is it?
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:25.760]   Spaced it up with the...
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:26.800]   Old space jam?
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.400]   No, it's like...
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.560]   It's like Warner Brothers dot something.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.080]   I mean, it's like from 1996 and it happened then updated.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.360]   It's got the trailer and that's it.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.240]   It's not very good.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.680]   Mm-hmm.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.160]   "Shame says the Brit here I've never seen space jam.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.680]   Is it worth watching or..."
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.160]   No.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.600]   You know, so let me tell you what's going on here.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.640]   I only did this really as a way to tease Christina
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.000]   because it's very age specific.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.160]   If you are of a certain age, an age where you were like 14 or whatever
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.280]   when space jam came out, you love it.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.280]   You love it.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.040]   But everybody else goes, "Well, that's dopey.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   It's like cartoons mixed with basketball.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.680]   I don't get it."
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:12.080]   But if it hit you at that right age, I have a new theory.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:12.960]   If I were a car...
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.000]   If I were a carny and I were looking for a gig,
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.320]   I would ask you your favorite song, your favorite movie,
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:22.720]   your favorite comic book, and I could tell you your age within six months.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.760]   Yeah, for me it's very speed up.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:26.320]   See?
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:26.800]   There you go.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.080]   I knew you were 50 years old.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.200]   I knew that.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.560]   So here it is.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.160]   I'm just...
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.040]   I'm a teasing you.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.560]   Spacejam.com/1996.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.360]   Let's go back...
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:37.520]   Oh.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.640]   That's what the web used to look like.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.000]   Yeah, see, that's the thing.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:42.960]   That's the website.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.480]   That's the website.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.440]   Look at that.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.000]   Wow.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.400]   This was so long ago they couldn't even use CSS to make the stars point off.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.480]   I mean, this was in fact the stars are repeating.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.240]   It's a very small GIF.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:54.800]   They're repeating.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.680]   Okay, which one should...
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.240]   Background.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:56.720]   Background.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:57.200]   Background.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.040]   Background tile.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.080]   And it's tiled.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.840]   Which one should I look at?
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.200]   How about the site map?
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:03.760]   Let's see.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.560]   No, that's bad.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.040]   Site map.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:05.600]   Oh my god.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.400]   Look at that.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:06.800]   That's the...
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.360]   Oh, good.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:07.600]   Creeze.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.800]   Even underlying the links.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:14.880]   And that particular shade of yellow on black, man, that says 1996.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.720]   This is my childhood.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.280]   Like this is...
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.480]   See, that's what I'm telling you.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.440]   You love it.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.440]   Because this was what the internet looked like.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.120]   Oh, look, the spinning games button.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.120]   Wow.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.200]   You know what? So funny, Leo, on Thursday,
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.800]   we launched a project startup.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.440]   Let's get live, you know, under my same brand as my show.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.400]   Oh, tell me about that.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.400]   What we did for April Fools was we built the first site
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.440]   as like a circa 1996 Geo City site.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.680]   And like three people actually said,
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.680]   "Okay, dude, what are you doing?
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.120]   Everybody else just did that.
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.400]   I don't want to hurt your feelings."
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.760]   Including the other half.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.520]   Did it want to hurt your feelings?
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.880]   They thought you did that on purpose?
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:55.680]   What's the URL?
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.320]   I got to see it.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.120]   Is it still out?
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.200]   It's back to normal because it was only up for April Fools.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.320]   But it was...
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.200]   Nobody wanted to tell us how horrible it was.
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.440]   We had the spinning like clippy.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.720]   The E for email was actually the old spinning E.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:11.920]   Like all pixelated.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.400]   I love that.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:12.880]   I love that.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.760]   We pixelated the Facebook and Instagram icons.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:16.640]   Like the whole night.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.520]   And I swear like three people just said something.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.640]   Everybody else just asked me,
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.360]   "Oh, this is great.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.080]   I really love it.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:22.720]   Rachel, look.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.920]   They're using the HTML tag for borders for the border.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.760]   They have frames and tables.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:30.320]   Like this is...
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.160]   I built my first website around the same time this one came out.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.320]   And it looks very similar.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.240]   I think that I use the same Geo City as HTML guide
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.760]   that they've ever built the space.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.280]   Jam website for one brother's taste.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.920]   So hilarious.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.680]   This is giving me flashbacks.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.480]   So April Fools is kind of a bust.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.560]   Google decided for the second year in a row
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.320]   that maybe they had better things to do.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.720]   No April Fools jokes from Google.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.600]   The only April Fools joke I saw.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.200]   I hate everybody.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.560]   It works in tech journalism.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.920]   It backed me up on the scene.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.840]   It hates April Fools.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.440]   Because you don't know what to believe.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:13.760]   March 29th, Volkswagen of America put out a press release.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.200]   I thought, well, it's March 29th.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.200]   They even said it's not an April Fools joke
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.240]   that they were going to rename Volkswagen of America
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.920]   "Volt"
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.840]   "Swaggin" with a T.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.000]   So they made a few strategic mistakes.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.760]   They released it three days too early.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.240]   By the way, I love the Verge.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.240]   From the company that brought you Dieselgate.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.440]   That is good.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.960]   There were people upset about it.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.520]   I was upset only because I believed it.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.320]   Because it wasn't April Fools, gosh darn it.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:47.360]   Well, we were March 29th Fools.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.440]   Yeah, March 29th Fools is famous.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.000]   But you know, we had the opposite problem that we put out a story
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.400]   which everyone thought was an April Fools joke,
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.320]   but it was actually a legitimate story.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.600]   Again, that's the problem.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.640]   Because you just don't know.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:01.200]   Exactly.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.080]   What was the story?
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.520]   Well, you know, actually lost on April Fools.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.560]   You remember, so trying to sue for ownership of Lynette.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.520]   Yes, yes.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.240]   That's brilliant.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.360]   Yeah, they're back.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:09.680]   What?
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.160]   I mean, IBM again over Union.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:12.400]   What?
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.840]   Are you serious?
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.680]   So we did this story.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.360]   It was just like, we got so many comments in the forum section
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.680]   it was just like, no, seriously, this is not an April Fools story.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.440]   We are, this is the legit thing.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.880]   Yeah, my god latest thing is back and they're trying it again.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.680]   And it's just horrifying.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.160]   Scow.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.040]   Oh my god.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:39.200]   Which is a Unix company, Santa Cruz operations.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.200]   Santa Cruz used to be called error here.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.080]   Claimed that they owned the right to Linux.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.800]   David Boyes was their attorney and.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.520]   Same guy as it was the Microsoft attorney.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.240]   In fact, there was this kind of Microsoft link with Scow.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.800]   David Boyes was the government's attorney.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.120]   He went after Microsoft.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:57.520]   Right.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.000]   He won.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.560]   That was why everybody was like, oh, maybe Scow's going to win
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.680]   because they have David Boyes.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.920]   And he was also Theranos' attorney.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.160]   And I mean, he's like.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.440]   Didn't that work out well?
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.640]   He's a hired gun.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.360]   He's considered the greatest living litigator.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.280]   And I'm not trying to try to demand that.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:17.040]   He did want to send me a letter vaguely legally threatening.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:17.440]   Really?
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.160]   I have framed.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:18.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.600]   Because I published things from the Sony email hack.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:29.280]   And he tried to like claim like there was nothing even remotely illegal about that.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.240]   And it was like such a clear cut case of like settled case law that like the lawyers laughed.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.640]   And I framed the letter because I'm sorry.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.120]   Yes.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.360]   It was pretty great to get like a vaguely threatening letter from David Boyes.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:41.760]   Wow.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.560]   That's pretty great.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.040]   The guy.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:43.680]   He's the man.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.800]   This is in the register.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.800]   It was to be fair March 31st.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.520]   IBM Red Hat face copyright.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:56.000]   And he trust lawsuit from Scow Group actually used from Sinuos,
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.600]   which is another terrible name.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.400]   Well, it's what they're calling the latest legislation vehicle,
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.960]   basically to try try on.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.680]   Yes, again, someone's chucked some money into it.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.800]   Let's go through the law once more more time.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.600]   I mean, you're going up against IBM and Red Hat.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.760]   I'm sorry, IBM lawyers sit in a darkened cage
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.560]   sharpening their teeth on the bones of their last victims.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:23.200]   These are not people with whom to screw around.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:29.360]   Yeah, it's the latest in Long Saga, but it was just it was hilarious to me
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.120]   because I was getting stony messages.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.160]   It's like, great April 4th, it's the day too early.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.320]   It's like, no, it's a legitimate news story.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:42.160]   So not only Space Jam back from 1996, but the school lawsuit is also back.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:47.440]   Well, the scope thing is like, I mean, Ian, you've been covering this for as long as it's been around.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.240]   I remember it because I was like in college, I had just started college,
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.840]   I think when it started and it's just like, it feels like it's never in any saga.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.560]   Like this, well, I feel old.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.920]   Like, that's me going back and like, oh my God, but it's this never in any saga,
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:02.800]   which is hysterical.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.520]   It's like, Scow is never really dead.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.280]   Which I kind of.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.280]   Oh, no, I mean, it just gets renamed.
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.200]   It's a new thing.
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.640]   It's the hydrides.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.000]   It's this great zombie, like horrific company that's just.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:16.800]   It's hydrides.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.840]   Well, what I would do is I would never go as far as the call you old.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:28.960]   It's not against us live, but I mean, it is film girl and like, most people don't even know what film is.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:30.560]   Oh, that's a good point.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:30.960]   I know.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.080]   It's a great point.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.920]   Do they think that you're like, you're covered with a thin layer of something that there's.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:36.720]   Probably.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.320]   Probably to think I'm like a real cute word.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.040]   What do they call it?
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.240]   It's a clean film.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.520]   A clean film.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.400]   A clean film girl is not taken.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.240]   You might want to snap that up real quick.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.280]   Netflix girl.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.800]   No, I can't change it.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:49.840]   This is the problem.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.560]   This is the problem.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.360]   Like I've had it for so long as the brand, I can't get rid of it.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:53.840]   Like.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.200]   I think of you as film girl.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.480]   Exactly.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.120]   Always.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:57.680]   Always.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.840]   You'll be 75 years old.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.320]   I'll still think of it.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.520]   You'll be 75 years old.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.000]   That's a good point.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.800]   And I will hopefully still look 29.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:05.760]   Yes, you will.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.320]   And still be the girl.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.960]   Thanks to the miracle of mRNA.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.200]   No one will ever age again.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.560]   And whatever Jane Fonda has done, like I'm done doing all of that.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.680]   Except don't marry Ted Turner because that's just not good.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.400]   You know, he and her were at my grandfather's funeral.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.680]   Wow.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.600]   Was your grandfather must have been some big shot?
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.560]   Well, they were friends.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.760]   They were longtime friends.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:40.400]   And so, yeah, my grandfather actually could have invested in what became TBS and said no.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.760]   Smart man.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.760]   Not that I'm ever, you know, think about that when I work and I'm like.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:46.400]   Just remember.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.080]   It'd be great if didn't have to do that.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.240]   They lost money millions of dollars a year for 10 years before they made a penny.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:52.800]   Oh, I know.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   I know.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.480]   So, no.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:59.840]   So, my grandfather was new Ted's father and new Ted.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:04.160]   Well, when Ted's father committed suicide, a bunch of local Atlanta businessmen,
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:09.200]   including my grandfather, like gave him money to kind of get like the billboard business and stuff
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.320]   back up and running it again.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:10.880]   Wow.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.720]   So, he was always, and he was always very kind to our family, you know, throughout the years.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.680]   And my dad hasn't talked to him in a long time, but I actually ran into him at like you
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.000]   in week once and he remembered my family.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   Wow.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:22.800]   It was very nice.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:23.680]   That's nice.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:24.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:28.320]   Somebody saying maybe you should call, you know, go all the way and call yourself to
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.280]   gear a type girl.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.920]   Wow.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:34.160]   Wow.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.280]   Just, you know, wow.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.560]   Really dig in.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.040]   Lean in.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:37.680]   Lean in.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.480]   Just lean in.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:45.360]   So, on the stock thing, I sympathize entirely because I can still, I still win this memory,
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.840]   but when Google went public, a friend of mine was like, "Shine vested it."
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.440]   It's like, "No, there'll be a battle of social."
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:51.920]   Oh, God.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.720]   So, it's been a long, you know, in a few years' time.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.000]   Does stock all drop to nothing?
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:56.640]   Forget about it.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.560]   I hear so many stories like the audience.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.360]   Still, you know, no one should ever listen to either of us for stock tips, obviously.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:07.760]   You know, it's a funny, you should say that, Leo, because we're in, okay, first of all,
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.320]   the first chance I was ever going to buy a stock, I was going to buy Apple, and it was like $4,
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.400]   and this was during the Silly years, and everybody was like, "No, don't do it."
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.800]   And I was like, "Oh, I'm just going to throw like 400 bucks at it.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.680]   It won't be that big a deal if I ever lose the money, no biggie."
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.360]   And everybody was like, "No, so I did it."
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.800]   And the second one was when--
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.160]   Do you still have the Apple stock?
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:32.000]   No, because when I left Apple from working there, I sold it because I was going in the tech
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.840]   journalism working at TUAW.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.400]   You had to.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:34.960]   You had to.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:35.520]   You had to.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.000]   You used to say--
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:36.960]   Oh, my God.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.680]   You used to say all the time that, you know, all the ethical tech journalists, they don't
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.680]   carry the stocks of the stuff they talk about.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:43.760]   Oh.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.720]   And I got that from you.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.040]   It's my fault.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:45.520]   And I'll--
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.080]   Oh, shoot.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.440]   I want to be Leo.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.720]   Oh, shoot.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.160]   I completely sold it all.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:50.800]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:55.600]   And then, like, a year and a half later, it will shut us down and try to make us become
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:58.400]   a gadget, which wasn't happening.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.480]   And then I found out later on, a lot of guys never really sold the stock,
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.760]   which is maybe illegal.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.480]   I get it, but--
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.480]   Well, it's not illegal, but it's not ethical.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.040]   It's not ethical.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.040]   You could put it in a blind trust.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.880]   You could put it in a blind trust.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:14.800]   You could transfer it to a family member, but yeah.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:15.600]   You still know.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:16.560]   It's still makes you feel--
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:17.120]   You still make you feel--
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.680]   You still have the ragged edge of ethical.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:20.640]   You know, I'm sorry.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.320]   If you're writing about this stuff and I know--
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.120]   I agree.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:23.840]   Certain crime--
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.840]   That's what I never held any until I left.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:26.880]   I'll just agree.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.560]   If you're writing about this stuff, you either don't own it,
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.880]   or you have to disclose it every time you write about it.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.600]   Simple as that.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.800]   So guilty.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.520]   So guilty.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.480]   I told that--
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.640]   I've told so many people that are wrong.
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.240]   Don't ever listen to me for stuck.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.280]   Well, you're not a financial meaner.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.160]   Look, you're the one.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:42.720]   You were right.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.640]   It's the right advice, but it's just the fact that I did it,
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:53.040]   and I swear at the time I left Apple was sitting at 124,
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.760]   and within a year it was up to 300.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.240]   I actually--
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.280]   I have a slightly worse story that maybe justifies all this.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.400]   I was the third--
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.640]   no, sorry, fourth employee at CNET.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.440]   You ever hear of them?
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:04.720]   Go ahead.
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.200]   Go ahead.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.640]   At one point, Halsey and everybody--
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.680]   there was only four of us.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.400]   They kind of ran low on money.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.080]   They said, if you put in $10,000,
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.600]   we'll give you a quarter of it.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.760]   And I had just bought a house.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.600]   I said, yeah, and I didn't think it was much.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.080]   Oh.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.040]   But $10,000, a quarter of CNET--
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:23.920]   well, it would have been worth it.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.760]   Yeah, because they sold a CVS for a billion dollars, right?
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.720]   Yeah, it would have been worth a lot.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.440]   So I got you--
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.480]   On the other hand, I bought my--
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.400]   You could have bought ZDTV.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.720]   I would own ZDTV today.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.680]   You would.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.720]   Well, I would see--
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.720]   and then I made the mistake, I butsees,
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.760]   for you, it would have paid off.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.080]   For me, I bought my Mashable stock,
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.040]   and when they sold--
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:45.920]   Oh, ouch.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.960]   Zero.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:51.840]   So the only upside about was I got like a $20,000
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.000]   like right off of my taxes,
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.280]   which I actually needed that year.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:55.760]   But--
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.440]   That's really common.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.440]   Because tech TV did the same thing.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.960]   They gave us all stock grants.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.720]   And at the time--
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.560]   And I think this is highly illegal.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:07.200]   The CEO did like a back-of-envelope calculations.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.880]   And someday you're going to be worth millions.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.440]   And then, of course, it lost millions.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.840]   And Paul Allen finally sold it.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.240]   And when he sold it, it was all set up
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.360]   so that he would be made whole
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.720]   before anybody else got a penny.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:21.200]   Exactly.
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.320]   Well, that was the thing,
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.560]   is that even though when Mashable sold--
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.640]   because there were a number of conflicting deals,
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:27.520]   I think that were in the works.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.800]   And the one that they finally took
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.320]   made the last investors, the last people in the whole.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.840]   But anybody who was earlier--
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:34.400]   That's how it works.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.280]   Which, exactly.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.920]   But anybody who was in earlier was screwed.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.360]   And please, we're obviously going to be screwed.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.360]   My grants were worthless.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.680]   And I had--
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.440]   I don't know-- 50,000 shares or something.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.440]   And it was worthless.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:47.920]   And it was--
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:51.120]   People don't understand that there are different payback schedules.
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.040]   And it's not obvious.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.520]   I mean, and in fairness,
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.640]   I mean, I had some--
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:59.360]   what earned it up to be incorrect,
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.760]   let's say, insider information that--
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.440]   I mean, seriously, I got burned.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.040]   But it was one of those things where,
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.720]   you work at a place for seven years,
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.680]   you help build it.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:12.000]   You don't want to walk away with nothing.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.440]   You know, it's a risk.
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:16.240]   But I still didn't necessarily anticipate it to be,
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.760]   you know, the way that it ended.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.320]   But I'm much happier.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.040]   Let me just say, like,
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.760]   working for a public company who doesn't issue me grants,
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.320]   but like--
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:26.400]   or doesn't issue me like the opportunity to buy.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:26.800]   But actually--
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:27.360]   You don't get options?
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:27.920]   You don't get options.
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.760]   You don't get shares better yet.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.520]   I get shares.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.000]   So--
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:32.560]   Which--
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.080]   I am not unhappy at all.
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:36.480]   I am just fine.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:36.880]   I don't--
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.400]   Just fine.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.720]   Doesn't bother me.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:42.880]   None of these lost opportunities bother me at all.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.280]   Because you are what you are, right?
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.080]   You would--
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:46.560]   Who knows?
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.640]   I could have ended up being Mark Cuban.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.360]   That's the last thing.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.400]   Yeah, you could have been Mark Cuban,
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.520]   but also it could have been--
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.320]   It could have gone the other way.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.040]   I mean, that's the thing.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.120]   It's like, you always remember those instances
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.400]   where we could have won.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:57.760]   But we don't have everything--
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.720]   All the ones you could have lost.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.120]   --because of like,
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:00.800]   you could have lost if you did not sit, right?
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:01.680]   So like, on the one hand,
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:02.640]   like, it sucks to be like,
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.440]   oh, I lost--
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:04.480]   I sold this Apple stock,
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.520]   and yeah, I made a profit,
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.200]   but it could have been bigger.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:08.800]   And you don't look at the situations where like,
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.480]   what if I'd worked at Blackberry, right?
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.480]   And I had that when it was--
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.320]   I got all that Blackberry stock.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.520]   I have all that Blackberry stock,
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:17.360]   and now it's worth like $7, right?
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.360]   Yeah, by not you now.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:19.680]   That's the thing.
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.720]   So Pixel 6, it looks like it's going to be powered
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.320]   by a Google-made chip.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.680]   This might be a trend happening in the tech industry.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:30.720]   Apple, of course,
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.320]   has always made the iPhone chips,
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.000]   but now they're making their desktop chips.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.240]   Google and almost all--
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.040]   almost all the other Android manufacturers
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.960]   have not been using--
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.280]   Google's been using Qualcomm chips.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.360]   Samsung, I think, is the only one
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.360]   that makes their own chips the Exynos.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.960]   And in fact, it looks like Google's
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:51.920]   white chapel chip will be made in partnership
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.760]   with Samsung.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.120]   It's not going to be an Exynos,
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.600]   but it will be Google's own.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.040]   There are real advantages
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.280]   if you're a big enough company to do this,
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.040]   and you have to wear with all to do this.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.640]   There have been some rumors that Microsoft
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.120]   might be doing their own thing as well.
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.400]   Yeah, I think that there's been a lot of rumors about that,
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.080]   and Google, I think, in Amazon too,
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.800]   they've been doing stuff in the server space,
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:15.440]   which is--
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:15.760]   Right.
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.960]   --I'm curious to see--
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.720]   So they already have designers on hand.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:19.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.440]   Right, so that's what I'm kind of curious about looking at.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.680]   This one, because it'll obviously be an arm chip,
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.080]   but I'm curious to know if this is going to be a cut down,
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.080]   maybe like bearing into what they're building
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.440]   for their cloud servers,
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.040]   or if this is just a completely different area.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.080]   And it makes sense.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.920]   9 to 5, Google says that they've seen documentation
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:39.520]   that says this falls,
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.600]   Pixel phones will be powered by Google's White Chapel platform.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:46.160]   So I would think it'd have to be pretty far along.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.280]   The Pixel's come out in September, October timeframe.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.800]   So they've got to be--
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.760]   I mean, they've got to be close to final design, if not--
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.680]   They're going to get sued.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:56.960]   They're going to get sued.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:58.000]   I would think it's--
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.480]   Pemberton Davis and Penny Jones.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:02.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.920]   Is that made up? That's made up.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.680]   No, that's White Chapel and a TV show.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.880]   Oh, OK. There you go.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.280]   Oh, I get it.
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.760]   Is that a British TV show?
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:13.120]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.560]   You should know it, Ian.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.440]   Ian's always pushing--
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:18.320]   Honestly, I've been watching Picky Blinders of Lake,
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.040]   but other than that, I've been staring clear British television
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.600]   because Britain is going slightly insane at the moment.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:24.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.240]   Oh, no, this show is older.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.280]   I want to say it like 2010, 2013.
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:30.880]   I remember the name, yeah.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.000]   Yeah, it's probably Amazon.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:32.800]   It's on Amazon.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:33.520]   Oh, it's on Amazon?
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.320]   All right, I'll watch it.
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:40.560]   White Chapel is code name Slider, which is not a good code name.
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:43.360]   There's another movie reference.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.000]   Any of the suitings?
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.200]   Yeah, Sliders, yeah.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:51.600]   Slider is a shared platform for the first White Chapel SOC,
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:52.560]   according to 9-5.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:53.280]   Worst.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.000]   Worst.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:54.560]   And the first--
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.440]   Yeah, same worst.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.320]   --and the first--
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:56.320]   --and it's--
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:56.800]   --and it's--
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:57.760]   Go ahead.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.400]   So this has been the problem with Pixel phones for a while now.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.560]   I mean, when they were the Nexus range, they were--
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.440]   They've been very true down--
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.320]   --and on their own.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.120]   --and on their own.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.880]   Easy to do.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.400]   Then they went the Apple route.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.720]   And now it seems like they're going back to their original route,
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.160]   not very expensive, stripped down, still going on.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:19.200]   But the new chip thing is going to be really interesting.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:25.200]   The rumor is they will be both for Android devices and Chromebooks.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.000]   That makes--
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.400]   OK, that makes the complete sense.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.080]   What would be interesting to me about this?
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:33.200]   It's less so much like the prowess of the chip itself,
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.120]   because I'm assuming it's still going to be using just
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.000]   standard arm--
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:36.720]   It'll be on.
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:37.440]   --like architecture.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.200]   Of course, it will be on, but I'm just saying,
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.680]   I'm assuming that it's going to be based on the existing platforms.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:46.400]   It would be if they're doing certain stuff that the Google
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.280]   software is then explicitly going to be tuned to.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:49.920]   Right?
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.080]   Like that, to me, becomes the interesting case,
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.360]   where you're saying, OK, are we building in some things
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:59.600]   into our hardware design that our software is going to be specifically tuned to
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.960]   around memory management or around the way that we handle security,
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:09.600]   or the way that we do AI or onboard processing or whatever?
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:12.560]   Because that's what makes the Apple stuff so special,
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.600]   is all the software and hardware integration.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.160]   And if this is also going to be used on Chromebooks,
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.840]   that becomes really interesting too.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.800]   And in my mind, let's me think--
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.560]   And I've been predicting this for years,
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:27.520]   and as of a lot of other people.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.400]   But this seems like it's going to become much closer to getting that fusion between
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.360]   the Chrome OS and the Android platforms.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:35.920]   That's smart.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.480]   Actually, that's what Apple's benefiting from with the M1 chip.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.880]   You can run native iOS apps right on the M1 processor.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:43.360]   Exactly.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.640]   And you can computer.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:49.360]   And I'm surprised that the Chrome OS or the Chromium Chromebooks.OS
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.200]   hasn't migrated to phones faster.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.960]   It would be really huge for them if they would get this straightened out sooner,
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:57.680]   rather than later.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.600]   Do you want Chrome OS to run on a phone?
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:04.400]   Well, only just due to the fact that it adds another option,
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.200]   and there are literally people right now who are in limbo.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.120]   They're not super stoked about iOS.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.720]   They're not stoked about Android.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.680]   They want something else.
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.600]   And Windows Phone was good.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.280]   I don't know what people did.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.080]   It's a sad thing.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.680]   But Windows Phone was good.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.960]   Well, you know, killed it.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.400]   Naki had messed it up.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.000]   No, the carriers messed it up.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.360]   Microsoft never--
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.600]   Well, there were a lot of people who made mistakes there.
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.840]   But I think-- and I remember talking to somebody from Huawei.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.680]   When Huawei announced, we're not going to sell phones in the US.
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.640]   And she told me, the reason very simply is you cannot make it in the United States,
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.720]   unless your cell phones are sold in carrier stores.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.720]   It just won't make it.
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.080]   Because people aren't--
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.600]   Too few people do what we do and go maybe to the Google site and buy a phone,
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.280]   or go on Amazon by phone.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.520]   Everybody goes to the carrier stores.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:52.800]   And so Huawei gave up.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:56.320]   And that's probably the Google Pixel.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:56.800]   And--
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.760]   I was massively hurt, though.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:00.480]   And with Microsoft, you know, they were too little, too late.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:05.040]   And even though they were in the stores, I heard time and time again,
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.960]   you'd go in a store saying, "I want a Windows phone."
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.640]   And they'd say, "No, no, you want the Samsung."
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.360]   They talked you out of it.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:10.960]   They just didn't want to sell.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.200]   That's why we have Apple stores to this day.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.960]   Way back in the day before--
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.600]   I was going to say the Apple Store's best sales channel.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:18.560]   Right.
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.360]   Before John Rontin was his name,
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.160]   went around and was trying to buy Apple stuff.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.920]   And they were like, "Oh, no, you don't want that."
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:28.240]   Or, "We don't sell Apple USB cables,"
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.360]   which is still funny to me.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.040]   They did a lot of stuff.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.920]   And so, yeah, the Apple Store kind of came out
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:39.200]   because of experience that Apple employees had trying to go get Apple stuff at computer city,
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:39.840]   which is now--
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:40.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.520]   And remember, what was it?
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.920]   They had an Apple branded mini store inside--
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.040]   CompUSA.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.480]   CompUSA.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.280]   CompUSA.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:50.320]   Ugly.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.240]   It was fly-spect.
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:53.920]   It was--
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.200]   And the poor employee who was there was an Apple employee,
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.840]   but he really didn't feel like he was part of the team.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.800]   It was terrible.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:01.600]   Yep.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.040]   I worked at CompUSA back then.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:03.440]   Did you?
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.200]   I completely remember.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:08.400]   And that was when we were pushing the digital hub.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.360]   So it was the Bondi Blue, that poster, where it sat in the center.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:16.480]   And then there's the CD and the iPod and the quick tape.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:16.880]   Right.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.320]   The quick tape.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:18.880]   Quick tape.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:19.520]   One.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.960]   Apple's digital camera.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.280]   Yes.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:21.760]   So that--
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.280]   That's 40.480.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.240]   Yes.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:24.560]   Yes.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:28.800]   So if you remember the iHub poster with the Bondi Blue in the middle
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.960]   and the things around the periphery,
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:34.560]   that was the branding for the in-store at CompUSA.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:34.880]   Tera.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:38.560]   And like, that was my spot stand on that mat and try to talk to people.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:39.520]   Were you the guy?
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:40.560]   Were you in the Apple?
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:40.800]   I was--
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.200]   I was--
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:42.320]   I was one of them, bro.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:45.600]   I was out working for CompUSA, but I used to stand in that spot.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.080]   Oh, I feel bad.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.360]   We didn't have an Apple employee.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.160]   Oh, man.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.400]   Oh, so it wasn't an Apple employee.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.040]   It was--
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.280]   They did-- towards the end of CompUSA,
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.640]   it became an Apple employee.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.000]   But in the beginning--
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.560]   and the reason why they brought in their own employees,
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:58.880]   right?
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:01.840]   God, I forget the guy's name.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:04.080]   He used to do it for a super big guy from Michigan.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.440]   So we used to just fight about Michigan
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.240]   in Notre Dame all day.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:07.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.360]   But the reason why they brought those guys in
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.560]   is because the CompUSA employees would be sending people
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.440]   to go buy whomever was giving the biggest
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:18.640]   spiff that we had to do.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:19.200]   That's the problem.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:19.680]   Yes.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.120]   Well, I was going to say the spits because I worked at Best Buy
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:24.560]   in high school and college.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:25.520]   Oh, my God.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.080]   I did.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.280]   And so it was funny because I would work full time
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.240]   during the summers.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:34.960]   And they really wanted me to quit college
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.240]   and just make best of my career.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:36.480]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.520]   That's smart.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.280]   That would have been a good one.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.720]   Well, although--
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.760]   I mean, I probably could have made like
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.640]   general manager or something.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:43.840]   But I did not want to do that.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.400]   And where would you be today?
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.160]   Probably in corporate, but exactly.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:48.720]   I mean, exactly.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.760]   I wouldn't have wanted to do that.
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.840]   But they really wanted that.
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.360]   They really wanted that because I was a nerd.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.480]   And I worked there.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.920]   I remember telling people in my interview, they're like,
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:57.920]   what's your goal here?
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.360]   I was like, to give better service
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.920]   that I've ever received at this work.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:02.520]   Oh, my God.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.720]   You guys are so important.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.800]   You're a good service.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.720]   Yes, exactly.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:06.200]   And so--
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.040]   That's what I told CompUSA.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:07.040]   It is.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:07.960]   The same thing.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:08.720]   Yes.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:11.200]   I said, I'm coming to work here because your guys service
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.680]   sucked and I want to fix it.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:13.180]   Wow.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:14.440]   That was really, really--
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.880]   Apparently, the right way to get a job.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:16.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:18.400]   Nobody knew anything.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.440]   Nobody knew anything.
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:21.800]   And I was with the rare person.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:25.160]   Appliances and car audio were the only two departments
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.280]   you couldn't slot me into.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.640]   But you could put me in any other part of the store.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:30.840]   And I knew something about everything we sold.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.160]   But anyway, we had spiffs.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:35.800]   I didn't get paid on commission, but the cell phone salesman
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:36.520]   did.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.120]   And so the sprint people would get bigger spiffs,
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.360]   depending on what phone they sell, same with the Verizon,
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:42.720]   same with the--
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.440]   It was always rumored that Microsoft
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.400]   should have spiffed the carrier salespeople
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.840]   because that's why they didn't get mentioned.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.280]   They totally should have.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:54.640]   True story.
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:58.880]   This is what killed Palm because Palm Pre was sold--
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.000]   it was a great phone.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.040]   It was a great operating system, but they just
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.800]   weren't willing to pay for cameras.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:06.640]   It was also on sprints.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:07.800]   I know.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.240]   There was that massive downfall.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.880]   I was a sprint TCS customer 20 years ago.
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:13.680]   That was--
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:16.680]   Honestly, I think that when it finally came to Verizon,
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:18.040]   Verizon was already all in on Android.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:18.840]   They didn't care anymore.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:22.240]   But it was on sprint and honestly--
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:23.760]   No, that's true.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.480]   Do you guys remember T-Mobile as voice stream?
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:26.960]   I do.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.640]   I actually-- I remember voice stream.
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.040]   I had it when it was Power Tell, which was a regional thing.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.680]   And then that became voice stream.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.360]   Was that when they were selling the sidekick?
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.160]   Or did they--
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:37.600]   Yeah, I was going to say the device we skipped
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.080]   was the danger sidekick.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.680]   I loved that phone.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:42.280]   When I was at Conclear and saved,
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.720]   that was my money maker.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:46.160]   Oh, that thing was flip open and the keyboard
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.560]   would be right there.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.800]   Can you imagine what Instagrammers today--
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:50.920]   I was still at all those things.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:54.160]   Man, make another sidekick with modern software
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.080]   and modern hardware.
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:56.640]   I would sell--
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:58.920]   And it was not conditioned with sucks.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:02.600]   But I would sell-- I always had my iPod on my person
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:03.560]   and my sidekick.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:07.800]   And the iPods, we had them in like behind glass.
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.440]   And so we wouldn't sell them.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:12.520]   And this was before the USB model came out.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.000]   So this was like the second gen, the first one
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.240]   that had PC support.
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:18.200]   And in the weekends, I would just hang out in that area
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.960]   and I would just have mine out of my hand.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.400]   And I would sell out the entire stock in usually about two
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:28.160]   and a half hours just by showing people the iPod.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.160]   That was all they needed to do.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.320]   They just needed to see it, but we didn't have any on display.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.000]   And so I would make-- that's with people.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.640]   How long is it going to take me to sell the 15 iPods we have?
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.360]   Cheeses.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:40.960]   And the same thing was sidekick.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.200]   I would just show people my sidekick
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.160]   and they would be like signing up, giving a T-Mobile plan.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.080]   That was the bump.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.880]   This is bring back memories.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.040]   When I got that, I thought I was Spock or Captain Kirk
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:53.520]   or something.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.160]   The screen didn't just slide up.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.840]   It swiveled up.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.320]   And then it had that--
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.760]   I forgot about the scroll wheel on the right.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:02.360]   The scroll wheel had aim on it.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:03.320]   Like you could do everything.
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.680]   Oh, if you go bitty-dip, if you could do the Star Trek sound?
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:07.840]   Oh, man.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.920]   Even my Star Trek was hacked so that when you open it,
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.680]   it was like, do the good, do the good, do the good.
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.200]   Yes.
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.840]   Man, that was such an amazing device.
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.760]   Oh, memory lane.
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:20.160]   We're going down memory lane.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:20.680]   Sorry, guys.
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.720]   You guys got old tech guys on Easter with--
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:25.880]   You know, when I was in high school and college,
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:26.840]   I worked at McDonald's.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:33.480]   And I too said, I just think you guys need better French fries.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:35.600]   They also said, are you going to hamburger
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.000]   you?
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:36.640]   I said no.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.720]   They said, see you later.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:41.760]   So I could right now, I could be a manager of McDonald's.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.680]   Just think about that.
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.440]   I'd be wearing this suit too.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:48.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.840]   Our show today.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.880]   Oh, before we do the ad, let me play this little--
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.320]   because I always forget to do it.
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:55.240]   They work so hard.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.120]   Our editors, they get together.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.160]   They have a special meeting.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.920]   They put together a little video just for you,
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:03.840]   the things you might have missed this week on Twitch.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.120]   Cabell Happy Easter.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:05.960]   Do you do anything?
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:06.800]   Oh, thank you.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.640]   Do you do anything?
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.080]   You hide eggs or anything?
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:11.840]   No, we're still trying to find one some eight years ago.
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:14.680]   And I hope we find it the smell is leading us.
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.120]   Yes, the 1,000 year old eggs.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.240]   Previously on Twitch, all about Android.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.040]   The Mi Mix Fold is upon us.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.280]   This is the new era for Xiaomi.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.720]   Mi Mix Fold folds inward like a book.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:31.480]   The camera uses liquid lens technology.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.000]   That means it handles macro and telephoto shots
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.320]   thanks to a layer of liquid and switching
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:39.720]   the electrical voltage through that liquid.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.080]   So in other words, a single lens could theoretically
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:46.000]   combine all the functions and multiple lenses on other phones.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.800]   Tech News Weekly.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:51.040]   A Nest Hub attracts your sleep.
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:54.040]   It uses Soli, which is the same radar technology
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.720]   that Google used in the Pixel 4 to do the Emotion Sense
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.720]   gestures that didn't work super well.
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.400]   It works better on the hub.
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.960]   The sleep sensing is really accurate.

[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:09.600]   Rosemary Orchard and I share our favorite accessories
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:14.120]   for iOS, iPadOS, maybe some Apple Watch accessories.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.640]   Twitter, now also available in several colors
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.400]   of unapologetic plastic.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:20.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.880]   We're so proud of that.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.280]   Thank you, Jim Cutler.
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:26.200]   Our show today brought to you by Gabby Insurance.
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:29.680]   How would you like to save $2,000 next year
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:32.400]   on your home insurance or your auto insurance?
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:34.080]   You've probably seen the ads for Gabby.
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:36.640]   Let me tell you, I saw the ads.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:39.320]   And we had just the day before gotten to notice
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.840]   that our home insurance was going to go up $8,000.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:47.320]   And I said, honey, I'm going with Gabby.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:49.960]   I had promised I would do the shopping
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:52.120]   for a better insurance policy, because we didn't
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:53.680]   want to pay the extra $8,000.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:56.600]   When I realized I had to go one by one
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:00.200]   to something like 40 different home insurance sites,
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.040]   and each one required me to re-enter the same data
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.480]   over and over and over again.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.840]   By the way, Gabby says it's on average
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:14.360]   1,100 keystrokes per site to get a quote and one by one.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.160]   Plus, they never make it comparable.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.160]   So it's very hard to shop your own insurance.
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.240]   Gabby has made it easy.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.520]   They've actually gone out.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:28.720]   They've encouraged insurance companies to create APIs
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:32.760]   so that the Gabby software can go out and do this automatically
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:35.400]   for you in minutes.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:38.880]   How would you like to keep an extra $961 a year in your pocket?
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:41.360]   That's how much, on average, Gabby customers
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.920]   save on car and home insurance.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.320]   I thought Gabby was great.
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.280]   In fact, I threw in our car insurance as well.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:50.200]   Now, I should explain so you don't get the thrown by this,
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:52.120]   that the way they get your car--
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.040]   there's no keystroke entries because the way they get
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:56.600]   your car insurance details and your home insurance details
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:00.120]   is you give them the logins to your insurance companies.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:01.440]   They get the information from them.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.040]   It's, of course, completely safe, completely private.
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:06.480]   But that way, they are going to compare apples to apples.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:09.440]   They're going to apply for exactly the same kind of insurance.
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:12.760]   Give you a quote from 40 of the top insurance providers,
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:15.880]   the big guys, progressive and nationwide and travelers.
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.880]   They immediately came back to us and said,
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:21.080]   we could save you $2,000 on your home insurance.
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.240]   The other thing I liked, they also came back and said,
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:25.360]   but by the way, you're getting the best price
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:26.520]   we could find on car insurance.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.200]   That made me feel pretty good.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.200]   It's like, well, OK, good.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:31.040]   I don't have to change my car insurance.
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:32.320]   But we did.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:35.960]   We did change our home insurance, thanks to Gabby.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.560]   We went through the whole process.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.920]   They connected with the insurance company.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:42.040]   They got us the quote.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.080]   Sometimes you may have to talk to an underwriter.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:46.960]   That's sometimes the way the insurance companies require
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:48.400]   you do it.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.440]   But all you have to do is link your current insurance
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.440]   accounts.
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.360]   You're going to get a quote in a few minutes.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.800]   It'll match the coverage you have.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:57.120]   That's why it's really important to use Gabby.
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:58.840]   If you want to move forward with one of the quotes
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:00.880]   the insurance company selected, we'll, of course,
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:03.520]   review the details, confirm the final price.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:09.520]   That price may change depending on what information they find out.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:11.360]   And sometimes you have to speak with a Gabby agent.
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:12.120]   We didn't have to.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.720]   It actually went very smoothly, very easy.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.400]   And it saved me a massive amount of time.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.480]   And $2,000 a year.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.520]   I mean, that's fantastic.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:25.040]   Now, on average, $961.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.160]   I was very pleased we saved twice that.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.120]   Wouldn't that be nice to have in your pocket?
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:32.480]   If they can't find you savings, they'll let you know.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:35.280]   So you don't have to worry about it.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:38.960]   And they promise they will never sell your info.
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:40.280]   And I can vouch for that.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.440]   Because I gave them that info, but I've received no spam.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:46.320]   I gave them a special email and a special phone number.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.640]   And that number has been dead silent ever since.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.880]   No spam, no robocalls, nothing.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:54.240]   They protect your information.
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.320]   I wanted to check them out.
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:55.920]   I really did.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:58.080]   And I am happy to say it worked great.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.600]   You know, you probably are overpaying on your car
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.560]   and home insurance.
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.800]   The insurance companies count on the fact
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.800]   that it's not easy for you to shop it.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:06.800]   Well, now it is.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.280]   And it's good news for consumers.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:09.640]   Let Gabby do the work.
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:10.920]   See how much they can save you.
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.640]   It costs you nothing to do it.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.280]   It's easy.
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:16.440]   You're not bound into insurance contract
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:17.520]   until the final step.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.160]   And you say so.
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:20.520]   No obligation.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.640]   gab.com/twit.
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:24.120]   I cannot speak more highly of this.
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:25.880]   This thing works absolutely.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.560]   And actually, I think I want to support them
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.800]   because they are, by their success,
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:32.160]   they are really pushing insurance companies
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:34.960]   to offer these kinds of APIs.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:36.440]   And that's good for consumers.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.560]   We're all going to benefit from Gabby.
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.720]   You could benefit right now.
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.000]   gabby.com/twit.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.800]   gab.com/twit.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.120]   This is where technology can really do a lot for you.
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:56.840]   On we go with the show, Facebook admits
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:00.240]   that half a billion records were stolen.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:02.360]   Actually, this personal information
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.760]   was leaked in 2019.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.720]   Facebook says we fixed the whole.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:07.960]   But now it's showed up on the dark web.
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:12.560]   It's being sold by a bad guy.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.280]   I don't think it's anything to freak out about.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.520]   It's not social security numbers or credit cards.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:23.200]   It's phone numbers, full names, location, email address,
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:29.040]   biographical information, the kind of stuff you give Facebook.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:33.440]   So should be aware of it.
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:34.360]   It's out there.
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.160]   It's half a billion users.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:38.880]   It does make me think Facebook should probably
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.200]   be doing a better job protecting all that information
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:42.560]   we give them.
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:44.360]   Then I saw this story.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:46.240]   This makes me so mad.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:50.360]   ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union, says,
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:56.240]   yeah, we've been sending user data to Facebook.
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:57.600]   What the hell?
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:58.520]   What?
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:51:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:51:59.960]   What the hell?
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:01.520]   What the hell?
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.840]   ACLU says it shares data with, quote,
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.360]   communications platforms, including Facebook,
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:10.920]   to deliver content to people who may be interested
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:13.160]   and to target specific users with digital ads.
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:15.720]   Now, I've always said you don't have
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:17.400]   to worry because Facebook's never
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:20.480]   going to give your personal information to an advertiser.
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.920]   They hold that tightly.
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:24.280]   They'll sell you in a block.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.160]   But that's their secret sauce.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.120]   But I didn't realize that advertisers
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:34.520]   may be giving information to Facebook to target ads.
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.840]   That's a really deep, dark, nasty part of the internet.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:41.280]   I am not happy.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:42.680]   We should delve into.
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:45.400]   They said, well, wait a minute.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:49.320]   Facebook promised us it would keep the data confidential.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:49.840]   And--
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:51.520]   And use it.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.960]   And use it only for the purpose of carrying out
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:57.480]   the functions we've engaged it to perform.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.600]   But then we know.
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:52:59.520]   I mean, the story I just told you
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.880]   showed you that Facebook cannot guarantee that.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.160]   No.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.480]   And no, I'm reading this article.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:07.080]   It says the data includes people's names, email addresses,
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:10.840]   phone numbers, country of residents, and zip codes.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:13.880]   ACLU, some of that information is not
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:17.000]   stuff that people who donate to your organization
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.800]   want public, let alone shared companies like Facebook,
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:24.800]   let alone benefits hacked and gone other places.
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:26.200]   I gift the ACLU.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:26.560]   Like--
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:27.160]   Me too.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:28.880]   I'm on that list.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.600]   Me too.
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:30.720]   Like, this is not making me--
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:31.920]   I do not have a Facebook account.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:32.920]   I have a Facebook account.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:33.520]   But now Facebook--
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.480]   It does all that stuff.
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:36.200]   I mean, I do.
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:37.080]   So they already knew this.
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:41.000]   But it doesn't make me feel any better that--
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.040]   I give to the ACLU in part because I don't want them
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:47.000]   reselling my information to third parties.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.160]   ACLU said, users can now opt out of having your data shared
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:55.200]   with third parties.
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:57.040]   Now that they got caught--
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:00.240]   Yeah, if you click on a little box, which is down right
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.840]   at the bottom of the terms and conditions
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:05.000]   behind the sign saying, "Beware of the Leopard."
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.800]   I mean, it's just shameful.
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:12.040]   So I'm not-- I'm going to guess on this.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:15.640]   But Facebook has always had one of the features of Facebook
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:18.200]   is you can-- in fact, I think it was.
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:20.040]   Was it Gary Vaynerchuk?
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:24.040]   Or some marketing guru told me this, oh, one of the best
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:27.360]   things of Facebook is you give them your mailing list.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.040]   These are people who are already subscribers or already
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:32.360]   devoted to you.
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:36.440]   And then Facebook will match-- will go through all those names
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.880]   and say, know what it knows about them and say, look,
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:42.720]   here's a list of equivalent lengths of people not on your list
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:44.960]   but who have the same attributes.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:47.520]   So they would be good people to reach out to.
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:50.840]   I mean, from an advertiser's point of view, that's gold.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:53.680]   These are people who are not yet subscribed.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:55.800]   But who have all the attributes of your subscribers
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:58.320]   so they would be most likely interested.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:01.200]   And I bet you that's something like what ACLU was doing.
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.360]   Here's all our donors.
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:04.400]   Here's the information.
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:06.600]   Now, tell us who else we should go after with the ads.
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:07.960]   Right.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:08.480]   Right.
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.160]   But that's not OK.
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:11.040]   No, it's not.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:13.280]   I understand that the organization is thinking, OK,
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:15.960]   we can now find a way to get more money out of this
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:17.920]   and have more people to go after.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:23.280]   But no, I give you money as an organization
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.120]   because you're supposed to be diametrically opposed
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.800]   to these sorts of things.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.760]   You need to do a better--
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:30.400]   find another way to do fundraising.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.320]   Find another way to increase your reach
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:36.520]   that doesn't include selling my data to Facebook.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:37.040]   Absolutely.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.400]   It's not the year that's saying, yeah, OK.
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:41.960]   Here's his bank account details.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:43.680]   Here's their email address.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.960]   Why didn't you market to them?
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:46.760]   You can give us some money.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:50.720]   It's just fundamentally wrong.
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:53.520]   I really support the ACLU's mission.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.880]   I give $100 a month.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:57.120]   I guess I'm going to cancel because of this.
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.640]   That's infuriating.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:00.760]   I don't know if I'm going to cancel,
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.800]   but I'm definitely going to rethink.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:05.200]   They could do something totally different,
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:08.560]   like where you run the information
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:12.920]   into a thing that would change all of the readable data
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:15.200]   into, say, hash it.
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:15.880]   Right.
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:19.120]   And then based off that hash, it could
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:20.880]   get what it needs, make the stuff,
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:22.200]   and then send another hash that
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.320]   matches the other database.
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:24.120]   Facebook.
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:25.800]   So none of it would have to implement that.
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.120]   Facebook would have to implement that.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:30.640]   Guess why Facebook doesn't implement that?
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:31.560]   Because they don't have to.
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.640]   They want the information.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:34.720]   They want the information.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:36.040]   They wanted to.
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:36.520]   Yes.
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:39.480]   And regardless, even if they could do this or whatever,
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:43.040]   the ACLU should draw a line of the sand here.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:44.120]   They should not be doing that.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:46.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:48.840]   I expect-- and I didn't realize the extent of this,
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:50.600]   that if you give to political campaigns,
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:51.680]   they sell your email address.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:52.720]   They sell your information.
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:53.200]   Well, that's tough.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:56.080]   By the way, that's legally public information.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:56.760]   You can search--
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:57.260]   Exactly.
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:58.080]   --every given you a political--
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:58.080]   --of a legal--
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:58.760]   --of a legal--
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:56:58.760]   --of a legal--
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:01.160]   --but also they then sell those lists and stuff
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:01.720]   to everybody.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:02.560]   Oh, believe me, I know.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.040]   And that's my reason.
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:05.800]   Because I get text messages from every liberal organization
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:06.560]   in the world.
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:07.200]   Because any--
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:08.040]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:08.400]   --you get to get--
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:09.760]   -- messages are good.
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:10.260]   Right.
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:10.760]   They--
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:11.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:11.760]   You can't even--
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:11.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:12.760]   --you can't even--
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:13.520]   Oh, what the--
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:16.600]   Supreme Court this week ruled with--
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:18.120]   I thought we were over that.
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:18.620]   Facebook--
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:20.600]   Because that stuff gets on my nerves, bro.
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:26.520]   On the other hand, I agree with Supreme Court
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:30.520]   that Facebook should be allowed to send text messages saying
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:32.480]   your information might have been compromised.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:37.600]   That's what the case was about.
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:40.200]   But to do it, they had to qualify as what's
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:43.360]   called an automatic telephone dialing system under the Telephone
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:45.840]   Consumer Protection Act.
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.800]   And they were sued.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:51.240]   And it went all the way up to the Supreme Court saying,
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:54.760]   Facebook, you should not be able to robocall people.
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:56.760]   Even though I think in this case, Facebook was right.
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:58.680]   This was a security alert saying somebody--
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:57:59.520]   That's right.
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:01.200]   That's appropriate.
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:04.600]   Supreme Court unanimously sided with Facebook.
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:10.000]   In the opinion just authored by Sonia Sotomayor,
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.960]   the court adopted a narrow--
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:13.360]   and I'm hoping this is really narrow--
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:15.760]   a narrow reading of a key definition,
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:19.440]   the federal ban on robocalls and robotexts, to cell phones.
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:26.320]   I don't know if it was narrow enough.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:29.360]   It held to qualify as an automatic telephone dialing
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:31.800]   system under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:35.800]   The device must have the capacity either to store or produce
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:39.800]   a telephone number using a random or sequential number
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:42.560]   generator.
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:45.840]   So they're saying because it's not a random number,
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:48.600]   it's OK to send this out.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:51.520]   The generator-- I'm looking at scotas blog,
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:53.520]   but generally the reports I've seen
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:56.640]   said this is seen as a real blow for people who
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:00.320]   don't like telemarketing because every telemarker is going
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:02.120]   to say, oh, good.
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:04.880]   We're not using random calls, so we can start--
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:07.040]   we have a phone number list, which we got from Facebook,
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:10.160]   probably, or the ACLU, depending on.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:13.040]   And we're just going to start dialing out.
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:15.600]   And so you're going to start getting lots more texts
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:18.800]   thanks to this.
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:23.360]   So thank you, Facebook, twice.
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:26.720]   Now, I'm just-- I mean, I'm not going to not give to the ACLU
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:27.240]   anymore.
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:29.120]   I still agree with-- I don't agree with all their decisions
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:30.720]   or all the things that I became worth it.
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:32.560]   But in general, I think it's a good organization.
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:36.920]   But like you said, I understand that my donations are public.
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:39.000]   I understand that information is being bought and sold
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:39.800]   and whatnot.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:43.400]   But the ACLU-- like the EFF, I would be like, no,
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:46.080]   but they're not going to take part in this.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:46.920]   They're not going to sell my--
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.560]   I didn't-- when I was told about this,
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:50.000]   I didn't run and say, oh, good.
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.480]   I'm going to sell my mailing list to Facebook or not send it.
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:52.920]   Right.
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:53.480]   Not even sell it.
[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:55.080]   Send it to Facebook so I can get this.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:56.960]   I didn't do that.
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:58.760]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:59:58.760 --> 01:59:59.200]   No.
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:00.280]   You would say the ACLU--
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:01.760]   Because you could do it like I respect my audience.
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:03.440]   Right.
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:08.080]   So apparently, one former ACLU attorney
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:11.480]   said, well, the problem is what happens on the 17th floor
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:13.360]   doesn't make it to the 19th floor.
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:15.040]   There's two different departments.
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:16.440]   And--
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:16.840]   You know--
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:19.280]   That excuses old and lame and many companies
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:21.080]   use that excuse all the time.
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:21.580]   Yeah.
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:22.080]   And--
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:22.560]   A little bit.
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:23.000]   Yes.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.400]   That has to stop.
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:26.680]   Getting away with that excuses sold.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:28.040]   I don't know if you guys remember--
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:30.040]   and I hate to keep bringing this up because it's funny.
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:31.720]   But the Bondi Blue, back in the day
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:33.680]   when it first came out, Connectix, which
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:35.680]   eventually become parallels--
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:36.160]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:39.320]   --the ability to play PS2 games, or it might have been PS1
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:40.160]   back then--
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:41.600]   Yes, just one game.
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:47.200]   --on the iMacs, which eventually, again, becomes parallels.
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:50.160]   And Sony Entertainment was like, yo, dope.
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:52.120]   All these back people can play our games.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:53.960]   And Sony hardware was like, not dope.
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:54.360]   Soon.
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:55.360]   Yep.
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:55.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:58.640]   Yeah, there was-- there was "Blean for PC" as well.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:00.600]   Yeah, which I don't think anybody--
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:01.240]   Sony ever liked.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:01.840]   Yeah, I remember that.
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:04.240]   Because what was called like, virtual game station or something?
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:05.280]   Virtual game station?
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:06.640]   That is correct.
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:09.360]   I remember-- I still have the--
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.280]   because that was when USB was brand new,
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:15.640]   I still had the old school Logitech joystick that was USB,
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:18.880]   so that it was a PlayStation controller made by Logitech
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:22.160]   to plug into the Bondi Blue.
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:24.000]   No, and it works great.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.760]   I think that I had it on one of the school computers,
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:30.280]   actually, that we installed it or whatever.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:34.200]   But I had "Believe" on my PC, which did the same thing.
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:36.400]   Like, you would insert the PlayStation disk.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:37.640]   It would play off of it.
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:39.480]   Had a USB PlayStation controller.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:41.960]   I was like, this is dope.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:42.160]   But--
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.600]   If they never-- see-- and this is where they messed up, right?
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:48.120]   If they never closed that kind of loop, right?
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:50.640]   Because they were afraid of what was going to happen.
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:53.200]   We probably would never have gotten an Xbox.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:54.840]   Because they would have had all of it built in.
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:57.920]   And then, more people would have bought games
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:01.280]   because they would play on their PCs, as well as their Macs,
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.280]   as well as their PlayStations.
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:05.920]   Then, I think a lot of the other competition never
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:07.240]   would have even surfaced.
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:11.040]   So then, hardware getting greedy and blocking S-E-N,
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:15.160]   AKA software side, they kind of screwed themselves.
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:18.160]   Like, they should have just left it the freak alone.
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:19.840]   They had to go and mess with it.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:21.400]   And they created all this competition.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:23.600]   And now they spend tons and tons of money
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.400]   trying to outdo Microsoft, which never would have probably
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:29.520]   had to even start, had they left it alone.
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:32.600]   Yeah, short term thinking, classic.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:33.440]   Let's take one more break.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:36.000]   And then, I have a wrap up of a number of stories
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.920]   we want to get to as quickly as we can.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:40.760]   We'll do a speed round with our wonderful panel,
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:45.000]   Christian Warren, from Microsoft developer advocate,
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.080]   film girl, as she likes to be known.
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:48.280]   DeGara type girl.
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:49.360]   DeGara type.
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:51.920]   I get DeGara type girl.
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:54.160]   Yeah, once you get that Twitter handle, you can never change.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:56.760]   That's why I use my name.
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:57.600]   I don't-- you know what?
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.320]   Your generation, they have handles.
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:02.240]   I see this in the chat room all the time.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:03.960]   People have bizarre handles.
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:06.280]   And it started with like their ICQ--
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:07.200]   Are they their A-names?
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.680]   Are their A-names, right?
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:10.440]   And you just never can-- you can never get rid of it.
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:10.960]   It's your brand.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.040]   They're a bit.
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:13.800]   Was it your A-name name?
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:16.760]   No, my name name was TV Freak 997.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:21.160]   Change the lower third.
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.680]   I am so glad it's film girl.
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:23.200]   That's the movie.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:25.880]   TV Freak 997 is in the house.
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:29.000]   Yeah, it's freak with a pH.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:29.960]   Freak.
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:30.480]   Wow.
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:31.560]   That's funny, guys.
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:32.360]   My name name was--
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:33.880]   Very nice '97, right?
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:35.600]   What was your name name?
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:36.520]   info Freak.
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:38.040]   info Freak 997.
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:40.320]   Meet-- wow, that's amazing.
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:40.960]   I was lucky.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.680]   I'm old, so I had no numbers.
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:44.320]   We didn't know you'd put numbers back there.
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:47.000]   We had this regular stuff, but I just
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.200]   wanted to be a computer nurse.
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:49.200]   So I did every freak.
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.680]   And I was into making, you know, little Hallmark cards.
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:55.400]   You put on a payphone for free calls.
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:55.880]   Yeah.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:58.040]   And that was called phone freaking back in the day.
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:03:59.640]   I was so leaked, hacks or--
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.360]   Oh, you are a leaked hacks or?
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.520]   So that's where I came from.
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:06.080]   Because I was making little freaking things with Hallmark
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:06.720]   cards.
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:09.400]   What kind of freak were you, Ian?
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:12.760]   I'm feeling dreadfully embarrassed.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:15.160]   I don't know if it's the same in the US, but in the UK,
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:19.760]   then you got credit on how much of your actual name
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:21.960]   you could get into a handle.
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:25.800]   So on Kix, which is the first UK bulletin board,
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:30.160]   I got ENT, which was pretty damn cool.
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:31.160]   Yeah.
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:34.040]   And in Britain, they know how to spell Ian.
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:35.400]   Well, OK.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:36.320]   Yes.
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:38.160]   I am rather annoyed about this.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.440]   America, please.
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:41.560]   There is no such word as lane.
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.760]   It's Ian with two I/O's.
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:46.040]   It's that simple.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:48.240]   I've never met anyone called Lane.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.880]   Please stop calling it me.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:55.240]   And my first chat handle was 75106, 3135.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.960]   So that's memorable.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.840]   Oh, wow.
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:58.240]   Is that--
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:58.840]   Copy, sir.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:04:59.240]   Copy, sir.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:04:59.720]   --going way back.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:00.440]   Copy, sir.
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:01.160]   Wow.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.400]   Yes.
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:05.400]   My ICQ was 1845645.
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:05.920]   There you go.
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:06.280]   That's right.
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:06.920]   ICQ is number--
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:07.240]   1, 2.
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:07.240]   --is number--
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:08.920]   9/4, 1, 9/4.
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:09.880]   Wow.
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:11.480]   I don't remember my ICQ number.
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.640]   I'm afraid.
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:17.360]   Our show today-- you guys are old.
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:20.480]   Our show today brought to you by extra hop.
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:21.520]   Oh, man.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:24.240]   We can't stop talking about the solar wind sunburst attack.
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:26.120]   And that was such a wake up call.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:29.560]   Then there was the Microsoft zero day exchange flaws.
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:31.320]   Oh, yay, yay.
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:35.080]   The problem is not only these cyber attacks more advanced,
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:37.600]   harder to detect, the real threat
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:42.760]   is the bad guys who are in your network thanks to these flaws.
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:45.400]   I think something like 90% of the exchange servers
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:46.520]   have been patched.
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:51.280]   But what we may never know is how many were attacked at the time
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:53.120]   and how many threat actors are just
[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:57.680]   advanced persistent threats living inside that network.
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:01.560]   The most advanced threat actors are the ones already in.
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:03.640]   The ones who've been there for a long time without our knowledge.
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:07.920]   When cyber criminals get past your defenses,
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:11.520]   businesses need a plan for detection.
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:13.000]   And of course, once you detect them,
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.880]   response, the old model of protection and prevention alone
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:17.840]   is no longer enough.
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:19.640]   We know that.
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:21.680]   That's why you need extra hop or VLX.
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:24.120]   It's the only solution that shows you not just where
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:27.520]   intruders are going, but where they've been.
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:30.080]   So you can investigate incidents and prevent them
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:32.480]   from turning into full blown breaches.
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:36.200]   When cyber attacks like solar winds and half of them
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:38.880]   make the news, the first question that security teams need
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:41.760]   to answer is have we been compromised?
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:45.240]   Extra hop or VLX makes it super simple to answer that question.
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:46.040]   This is what you need.
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:49.520]   90 days of record look back, complete network visibility
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:51.840]   across the data center, the cloud, all the way
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:53.560]   to the device edge.
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:56.200]   That means the security team can get the answers they need
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:58.240]   and they get them right away.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:01.280]   In this post compromise world, your greatest chance
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:04.680]   at stopping advanced threats is with extra hop network
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:06.760]   detection and response NDR.
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:11.320]   Learn more about how extra hop stops breaches, 84% faster.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:13.320]   You can explore the interactive demo right now.
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:14.400]   It's very cool, actually.
[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:17.480]   You're going to love this at extrahop.com/twit.
[02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:20.840]   Extrahop.com/twit.
[02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:23.480]   Somebody in the Twit community was asking,
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:24.200]   what's the name of that?
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:25.360]   What's the name of that?
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:27.160]   I can't remember it, extra hop.
[02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:30.440]   Think of a bunny taking one more jump.
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:33.880]   Extrahop.com/twit.
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:37.800]   We thank him for supporting this week in tech.
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:42.320]   TSMC, the big Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing company
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:46.920]   has announced they are going to spend $100 billion
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:47.920]   over the next three years.
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.040]   This is their response.
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:50.320]   They make all the Apple chips.
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.360]   This is their response to the chip shortage,
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:53.720]   which has been devastating.
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:56.000]   That's why you can't get a G-Force.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:01.040]   You can't get a PlayStation 5 and a Xbox Series X.
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:05.720]   TSMC is going to build fabs big time.
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:09.200]   Some of them even in the US, most of them I think in Taiwan.
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:12.920]   Qualcomm is sending it to the US.
[02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:17.880]   It's come to a pretty state for fairs, where TSMC
[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:21.360]   is putting $100 billion into it.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.720]   The US government is putting $50 billion,
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:25.920]   and Intel is putting $20 billion.
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:27.640]   It's like, right, OK.
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:32.080]   So we might be a little behind the scale on this.
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:33.880]   If fabs are phenomenally expensive,
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:36.160]   I remember when it was $1 billion to build a fab.
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:37.240]   It's 10 times more now.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:39.840]   It's $10 billion, at least.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:42.360]   I mean, that's been Intel's--
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:44.920]   I mean, they're Intel-as-so screwed right now,
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:47.040]   but that's been historically one of their big advantages
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:48.760]   is that they have their own fabs, right?
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:50.520]   And they're doubling down on that.
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:53.760]   We thought they might move to the fabulous model.
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:54.120]   Fabulous.
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:56.440]   No, they're going to go pack yells into the--
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:57.120]   Which I think is--
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.680]   CEO says we're doubling down on this.
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:00.800]   Which I think is actually the correct thing for them to do.
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:03.240]   They need to get their nanometer processed, figure it out, right?
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:04.360]   Still at 14.
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:05.560]   Still at 14.
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:09.160]   Still at 14, but they need to crack.
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:12.040]   Right, when they crack that, and I do trust that they will,
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:14.160]   I do actually think that having their own fabs
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:17.880]   is the right move, because we see what happens when--
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:20.640]   I mean, look, it was a whole, like,
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:22.280]   calamity of events coinciding.
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:24.600]   But when you do have these fab shortages,
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:29.880]   when everybody's using TSMC, and when even non-TSMC fabs
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:34.000]   are all pushed to their limits, and cars can't be made.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.200]   And basically--
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:39.200]   And then when you have the water shortages in Taiwan,
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:41.160]   where they're having to ship the water in,
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.760]   so that they can actually run the fabs,
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:44.520]   like, there's been so many disasters,
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:47.360]   I actually do feel like, yeah, Intel having its own fabs,
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:51.040]   it's expensive, it makes them slower to maybe iterate
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:54.920]   than the fabless chip makers, like AMD or whatever.
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.360]   But yeah, I think it's a benefit, right?
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.360]   It's also because there's some, I think,
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:05.560]   shakiness in the fact that all of our chips are made in Asia.
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:06.680]   And that Taiwan--
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:09.480]   I mean, Taiwan's a constant under constant threat
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:11.760]   from China.
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:15.640]   So I don't know where TSMC is going to build these,
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:19.280]   but it would be probably wise to build them in other regions.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:20.040]   Definitely.
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:21.160]   A couple of--
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:22.160]   Sorry.
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:22.680]   No one--
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:24.560]   OK, they are doing a couple of fabs in the US.
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:25.560]   OK.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:26.280]   But you're right.
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:29.960]   An awful lot of their key technology is based in Taiwan,
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:34.160]   and China can walk in there any time it wants.
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.680]   And there's not a lot anyone else can do to stop that.
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:40.120]   So it makes sense to diversify on that front.
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:43.840]   But as Christine was saying, the amount of money involved
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:48.760]   in fab plants now is so much higher than it was.
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:51.200]   Intel's new fabs are $10 billion each.
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.000]   They're going to build two new fabs in Arizona for 20 billion.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000]   Yeah, and they've done some bad ones as well.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000]   Yeah.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.720]   TSMC is going to spend that $100 billion over three years.
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:03.560]   Samsung is going to spend $116 billion over 10 years.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:07.680]   I mean, Ford has suspended production of its F-150
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:09.240]   because they can't get the chips.
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:10.600]   You can't get the chips.
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:12.640]   I mean, I think this is actually one of the opportunities
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:13.800]   for Intel.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:17.080]   This is what the new CEO was saying.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:19.000]   And this is a different model for them, right?
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.240]   Before they maybe would kind of let other people use their fast,
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:24.480]   but that really wasn't their model.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:26.120]   It was all Intel using it.
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:27.840]   But now they're going to be basically saying, hey,
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:29.280]   we can be your fab.
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:33.080]   Yeah, but who wants to make a 14 nanometer M1?
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:34.000]   No one.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.480]   Apple's going to be three nanometers.
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:37.360]   Apple's going to be five.
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:38.000]   No.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:38.720]   There's five now.
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:39.960]   There's going to be three nanometers.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:40.480]   No, totally.
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:41.120]   I mean, you're not wrong.
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:42.880]   But I'm just saying, I mean, you could also
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:45.760]   conceive that they could have retrofitting tooling for stuff.
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:48.680]   There are things you can do when you're building those fabs out
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:52.400]   where it might not have to be just what the current nanometer
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:53.720]   process is, right?
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:54.320]   And then this is--
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:59.520]   Intel released this week their 11th generation Rocket Lake
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.560]   S gaming CPUs.
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:05.120]   Jim Salter's article in R's Technica,
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:08.280]   "Sad Digital Trombone."
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:10.280]   They did not impress us.
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:12.680]   It does not look like a very compelling upgrade,
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:15.280]   especially when your lunch is getting eaten by AMD,
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:17.000]   Ryzen chips.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.080]   Both Christine and I just built new PCs
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:22.160]   or bought new PCs with the Ryzen.
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:22.840]   Ryzen--
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:24.400]   I call mine, by the way.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:25.440]   Thanks to the chat room.
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:28.840]   I said I told the chat room, I need a name for my new computer.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:32.720]   And I think it was retcon who said, how about Mojo Ryzen?
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:33.360]   And that's what I'm--
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:34.680]   Mojo Ryzen, I love it.
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:35.800]   Got my Mojo Ryzen.
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:37.280]   But yeah.
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:38.480]   Hey, Ryzen Shine, that's a good--
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.560]   You can have that one, Christine.
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:41.880]   Yeah, Christine, that's a good sign.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:44.400]   Yeah, no, I mean, the Ryzen is killing it, right?
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:49.360]   And Lisa Sue is such a badass.
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:50.360]   I love her.
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:53.200]   You know what I'm excited to see in video's GTC,
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:56.360]   their conference is coming April 12th in a week.
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:59.200]   In fact, we're going to stream the keynote 8.30 AM.
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.000]   Oh my god.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.400]   On Monday, April 12th, I'll be getting up a little early.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:08.600]   The only thing that scares me--
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:09.480]   What?
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:10.600]   That's 5.30 here.
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:12.600]   So you're going to get up with me?
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:14.120]   Heck no.
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:18.480]   Heck, I'm already up because I get up to the East Coast Times
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:19.560]   thanks to kidding Glenn.
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:20.720]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.760]   You're forced to, huh?
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:25.080]   So the sun won't be up where Doc Rocky is.
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:26.800]   But the only thing I'm a little nervous
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:30.640]   because Samable Sam had said, just be aware that Jensen Wong,
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:32.260]   the founder and CEO of NVIDIA, is
[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:36.840]   NVIDIA is famous for his two plus hour three notes.
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:40.440]   So I might be a long Monday morning for me a week from Monday.
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:41.440]   But I will be--
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:42.480]   Get a bottle.
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:45.200]   This is a-- yeah, I'll get a bottle.
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:47.080]   Shoot for the bull's eye.
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:50.280]   This is going to be interesting, though,
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.640]   because look at what NVIDIA talked about firing
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:53.880]   on all cylinders.
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:57.160]   Not only is it the in-demand GPU for gaming,
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:01.240]   for mining, coin mining, Bitcoin, Ethereum, et cetera.
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:03.800]   For AI, for artificial intelligence.
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:05.720]   Yeah, the artificial intelligence.
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:10.360]   For self-driving vehicles, they have a big car market.
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:12.880]   This is the hottest company out there right now.
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:13.680]   They might be able to--
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:15.440]   They might be by arm.
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:16.440]   That's still up for us.
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:18.040]   Is that still in the--
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:19.440]   Possibly going.
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:21.120]   Regulators are still debating that.
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:24.240]   But presumably are still going forward.
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:26.480]   What was it, $22 billion?
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.120]   Wow.
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:33.960]   Activision reveals, do not download the Call of Duty Warzone
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:37.200]   cheats their malware.
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:38.840]   Whoops.
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:41.760]   Honestly, anyone who's downloading cheats deserves to get
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:42.760]   started.
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:44.600]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:45.600]   Seriously.
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:47.600]   That's what you're doing now.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:48.560]   You deserve it.
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:49.640]   Don't do it, man.
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:51.400]   Don't do it.
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:55.120]   If you have a ubiquity router, as I do, as you do, John,
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:57.280]   I hope you've changed your password.
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:14:58.880]   As I do.
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:00.000]   Well, there you go.
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.320]   The only one who doesn't, apparently, is Ian.
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:05.480]   The ubiquity was hacked.
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.760]   I'm so glad they did the routers, though.
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:12.000]   The ubiquity is hacked in December, but did not make a big deal.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.240]   They kind of mentioned January.
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:15.520]   You probably should change your password.
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:17.200]   Did not make a big deal.
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:18.400]   January 11.
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:21.800]   They threw a dead cat on the table, as we say, in the industry.
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:24.960]   Basically, they put out a statement this week saying,
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:29.320]   no personal information was lost, which kind of--
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:30.760]   yeah, it's true.
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:33.160]   But the point of Grumps' story was
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:35.280]   they managed to get into your source code.
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:38.960]   They managed to get into your basic admin level access.
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:42.960]   So yeah, no customer personal information was lost.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:46.000]   But in the meantime, you've been comprehensively poked.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.560]   They'll get it later after they break into your system.
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:54.520]   Krebs said, if you have ubiquity devices installed, we all do,
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:56.800]   and you haven't yet changed a password on the devices
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:00.480]   since January 11, now would be a good time to take care of that.
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:03.760]   It also might be a good idea to delete any profiles
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:05.960]   you had on those devices, make sure they're
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:07.720]   up to date on the latest firmware,
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:10.840]   and then recreate those profiles with new and preferably
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:13.760]   unique credentials, and seriously consider
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:16.120]   disabling any remote access on the devices.
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:18.480]   Just a word of warning.
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:20.600]   You don't have cloud keys in order
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:22.120]   to get into the routers.
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:24.480]   Like that's the whole point of the cloud key,
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:29.200]   which is a $199 to $300 device, depending on which one you get.
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:32.480]   So I bought the new UDM, the Dream Machine,
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:35.120]   so it has the cloud key built into the router.
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.880]   But yeah, you might want to consider--
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:40.560]   I've been thinking of upgrading to the rack version of the UDM.
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:41.320]   That's what I have.
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.720]   Because right now I have all the separate pieces,
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:48.600]   and I just look at them and go, all of you could be one box.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:51.640]   What has your experience been, though, with the firmware?
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:53.680]   Because I've had problems.
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.400]   I mean, you definitely don't want to use the beta.
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:58.600]   No, but I've been good so far.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.000]   My big, big, big stuff has been really, really good.
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.320]   I just love it.
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:04.040]   Because I think what's impressive to me
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:07.600]   is everyone is out here buying bigger and better things
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:09.960]   with all kinds of stuff growing out the side,
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:13.800]   in like 900 antennas, and really crappy UI.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:16.080]   But yet the commercial one that's not
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:19.920]   supposed to be for the end user has one of the best UIs out there
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.320]   that I could probably throw my 11-year-old niece at it,
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:23.680]   and she could handle it.
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:26.520]   I would have gone with Ruckus, but there's a yearly fee.
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:28.520]   And maybe I should have--
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:30.480]   this is my ubiquity rack.
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:31.840]   There's that beautiful rack metal.
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:32.680]   Oh, that's beautiful.
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:33.280]   Right in the middle.
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:33.680]   Isn't that clean?
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:35.520]   I didn't want that fucking on the side.
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:36.640]   That's all I wanted for us.
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:39.040]   I can put my phone over there and go, ooh, no, no.
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:41.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:45.440]   And I have to say the access points are really rock solid.
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:51.720]   So I had to do this because Lisa was just very upset
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:53.240]   with the quality of the Wi-Fi.
[02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:56.160]   And when she was working at home, Michael was attending high school
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:57.320]   at home.
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:17:58.080]   It wasn't working.
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:17:59.880]   So I just bit the bullet.
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:00.720]   And it worked.
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:01.320]   Very happy.
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:08.000]   But I guess a password changes in the offing.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.080]   Let's see film girls here.
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:10.400]   So she might be interested in the fact
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:14.240]   that Comcast is thinking about moving its universal movies
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:18.840]   from HBO Max and Netflix over to their new peacock,
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:23.040]   further fragmenting the streaming world.
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:23.880]   Why is it stupid?
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:24.640]   There's no reason.
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:27.760]   Well, no, because there's a reason that this model has
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:32.520]   existed for 30 plus years, which is that you license
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:34.920]   or you sell your films to different services.
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:38.440]   It's why Warner Brothers films could be on Showtime.
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:41.240]   They weren't just on HBO, even though HBO and Warner Brothers
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:43.480]   have been the same company for decades.
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:47.000]   Like you go to wherever the highest bidder is going to be.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.160]   You shouldn't force it to be on your service.
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:54.040]   I feel like this is dumb because NBC, Comcast, whatever,
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:56.640]   is doing this thinking, oh, the desire
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:00.840]   to see these films will be so strong that people will sign up
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:01.640]   for our service.
[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:03.480]   No, that's not the case.
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:05.480]   There are a few cases where that'll happen.
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:07.720]   But usually that's going to be your original properties.
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:10.560]   You simply seem like the only way you can watch this content,
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.080]   especially if it's catalog, is if you sign up for this service.
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:17.160]   We talked about earlier how much choice we have
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:18.080]   when our content.
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:21.120]   People will just choose not to watch your content.
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:24.560]   So I mean, I think that it's completely misguided
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:25.280]   and short-sighted.
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:28.960]   I mean, I understand if you're developing new properties
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:31.640]   to make it on your service first, fine, right?
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:36.400]   But if you're talking about taking stuff away
[02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:38.680]   and not going to the zeal, it's like, OK, congratulations.
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:40.800]   You've just lost the mind share that's
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:42.320]   already on these other places.
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:46.040]   Because they need subscribers to peacock.
[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:47.080]   I get it.
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.440]   But this just seems completely short-sighted to me.
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:51.920]   Isn't there a better way to do it?
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:55.320]   Right now, you invest in making new content that will get you
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:56.320]   to come to it.
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:59.160]   The only reason why I own peacock right now
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:00.560]   is the Premier League.
[02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:02.120]   If it wasn't for the Premier League,
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.200]   I wouldn't ever turn that thing on.
[02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:06.000]   But glory, glory, man, you're not in it.
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.080]   I'm there.
[02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:10.720]   Well, it's funny because everybody hated cable.
[02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:11.760]   And I said, disaggregate.
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:13.160]   We want to buy a lot of cars.
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:14.320]   No, no, it's just cable all over again.
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:15.520]   And it's just cable all over again.
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:18.120]   It's disaggregated in the Premier League.
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:19.000]   Yeah.
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:22.320]   Because the guys running the ship are all the people you say.
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:24.520]   They're still there.
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:27.080]   They never got away from it.
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:28.680]   All right, let's end on a happy note then.
[02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:29.680]   None of this sad stuff.
[02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:32.920]   Ingenuity is now on Mars.
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:39.880]   This is the drone that was attached to the Perseverance Rover.
[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:42.960]   It dropped it, a four inches off the bottom.
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:45.920]   It is touched down and then immediately moved back.
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:47.880]   That's why we have this beautiful shot
[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:50.640]   from a distance of the hovercraft.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:54.080]   Probably will be a week before it takes off.
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:55.560]   But so far, so good.
[02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:58.520]   Lots of tests are being very careful moving very slowly.
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:03.520]   The first quadcopter on Mars.
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:04.560]   It's not a quadcopter.
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:06.400]   It's a duocopter.
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:07.840]   It's a one copter.
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:10.040]   It's a helicopter.
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:10.520]   Yeah, you're right.
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:11.560]   It's not a quadcopter.
[02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:12.680]   It only has a helicopter.
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:13.680]   It's a unit.
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:15.080]   It's an old-fashioned.
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:16.240]   But how many blades?
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:20.800]   It has to have a lot of blades because the air is very thin.
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:23.320]   Two giant blades.
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:23.920]   There it is.
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:25.040]   Ingenuity.
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:25.640]   This is so exciting.
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:27.080]   It's like Arizona.
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:28.560]   You guys are talking about it.
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:30.360]   It looks just-- honestly, it does.
[02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:31.760]   It looks like the Mojave, doesn't it?
[02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:33.080]   Yeah.
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:34.160]   Oh, well.
[02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:35.080]   Where's Matt Damon?
[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:37.760]   Then I'll believe it.
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:39.640]   He's going to science the stuff in out of it.
[02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:42.120]   That's what he's going to do.
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:43.280]   Beautiful pictures, though.
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:45.920]   I have to say, even from Arizona,
[02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:51.680]   these are good pictures of the ingenuity from perseverance.
[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:52.560]   So cool.
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:54.440]   Isn't that cool?
[02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:56.360]   And there's a Starbucks up there somewhere.
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:59.400]   There's probably four because I don't think you can have one
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:00.640]   Starbucks anywhere.
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:02.200]   No, you've got to have multiples, right?
[02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:03.760]   Just in case.
[02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:04.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:05.440]   You've got to have the one to drive through.
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:06.960]   You've got to have the walk up.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:07.960]   Yeah.
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:08.460]   Yeah.
[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:11.840]   And I promise I will not attempt to fly.
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:13.400]   The copter.
[02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:18.280]   I'm not allowed to touch any kind of flying machines anymore.
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:21.560]   Christina, so nice to see you, Christina Warren.
[02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:26.200]   She's film_girl on the Twitter, senior cloud advocate
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:26.920]   at Microsoft.
[02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:27.920]   You're getting ready for build.
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:28.960]   I bet already, right?
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:29.640]   Yes.
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:30.040]   Yep.
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:30.480]   Yep.
[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:31.240]   Very excited.
[02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:33.760]   Be sure to join us May 25th.
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:36.560]   And of course, you're still doing rocket, right?
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:41.320]   I'm still doing rocket, really FM/rocket every week
[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:43.600]   with me and Brianna Blue and Smoondorosh 4.
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:45.200]   And it's a really fun time.
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:45.840]   Nice.
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:46.800]   Really good show.
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:49.680]   Accelerated geek conversation.
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:51.360]   And just three of the nicest people.
[02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:52.480]   I really love all three of you.
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:55.680]   So it's a must listen.
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:56.960]   Thank you, Ian Thompson.
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:59.720]   Who can-- I mean, you can't live without reading
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:01.520]   the register every day.
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:05.280]   Theregister.com, Ian is their news editor.
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:06.320]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:10.880]   Oh, he's muted.
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:11.880]   You're muted, Ian.
[02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:12.520]   I don't--
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:14.040]   Oh, we muted him.
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:14.680]   We muted him.
[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:18.400]   We didn't want to hear the P bottle.
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:21.080]   OK, sign language is fine.
[02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:22.280]   Sign language is fine.
[02:23:22.280 --> 02:23:23.320]   Thank you, Ian, so much.
[02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:25.400]   I'm glad you lost the mustache.
[02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:27.360]   Yeah, I think his signal's breaking up.
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:28.000]   Me too.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.240]   Yes.
[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:30.040]   Thank you, Ian.
[02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:32.360]   And by the way, we've got a better signal from Mars
[02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:33.120]   than we get from Ian.
[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:35.760]   I don't understand how that's possible.
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:38.000]   He's the closest of all of you.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:42.080]   And of course, Doc Rock out there in Hawaiian time zone,
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:43.920]   where it's probably three in the afternoon,
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:45.360]   two in the afternoon.
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:45.920]   Two in the afternoon.
[02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:46.680]   Beautiful day.
[02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:48.520]   You get to go out and enjoy the beach.
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:51.640]   YouTube.com/docrock@docrock.
[02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:54.240]   Brand ambassador for Ecamm.
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:56.640]   And honestly, we--
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:58.800]   Michael lives on Ecamm.
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:23:59.480]   Yes, he did.
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:02.160]   I just saw him moving around in the community.
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:06.440]   Recently, we just became the first native platform
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:08.440]   for screaming for M1.
[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:10.360]   Oh, you're M1 native now?
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:11.880]   We're M1 native now.
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:13.440]   Awesome.
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:15.200]   It's a really great way to do--
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:18.480]   Michael does iOS today from his house using Ecamm.
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:19.480]   He could switch cameras.
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:20.360]   He could do a screen.
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:22.520]   He could do-- it's really a great way to do it.
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:26.240]   And of course, it lets you use your iPhone as a camera,
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:28.120]   along with everything else you've got.
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:30.120]   The best part is using it in Zoom.
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:32.480]   And yeah, so that kind of helps out.
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:34.400]   And sometimes we work with teams,
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:37.120]   but sometimes Christina's friends kick us out.
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:39.920]   So I got to talk to her so I can get a better connection
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:41.360]   in teams because it's--
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:43.160]   I can help you with that, sir.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:44.400]   I can help you with that.
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:45.520]   Oh my god.
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:47.920]   You-- hey, Ken and Glenn, she's going to help me.
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:48.840]   I get a raise, OK?
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:50.840]   Yay.
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:52.040]   Yay.
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:53.120]   Ecamm's a great company.
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:54.120]   Ecamm's a great company.
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:55.240]   Ecamm's a great--
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:55.760]   They really are.
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:56.520]   We love them.
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:25:00.040]   And it's nice to have Doc on always on the show.
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:01.280]   We really appreciate it.
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:04.080]   I have never seen that picture of you visiting our studio
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:05.600]   back in 2015.
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:07.280]   That's-- I was sitting right in front of you,
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:09.880]   but you were busy talking about, again,
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:11.680]   our favorite restaurant across the street
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:12.560]   was Helena's--
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:13.760]   Oh, Halleys.
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:14.320]   Halleys.
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:15.000]   That's what it is.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:15.560]   Halleys.
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:16.920]   And there's still open, by the way.
[02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:18.480]   I was in the meet coma, on coming back.
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:19.560]   Oh, yeah.
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:21.400]   We always knew it was right across the street
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:22.200]   from the old studio.
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:23.480]   And it was a breakfast lunch place.
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:24.280]   It's not open for dinner.
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:27.320]   They were open now, but they outdoor are dining only.
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:29.240]   And I always knew when somebody had eaten there, at least
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:31.640]   then, because you'd smell like home fries
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:32.840]   when you came in the door.
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:35.760]   It was like, oh, yeah, hash browns, huh?
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:37.200]   All right.
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:38.200]   Thank you, Doc Rock.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:38.840]   Thank you, Christina.
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:39.320]   Thank you.
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:39.840]   Thank you.
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:40.040]   I appreciate it.
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:41.320]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:44.200]   We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon,
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:49.480]   right after the radio show, about 230 Eastern 530 Pacific,
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.040]   about 11 in the morning, a while in time.
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:53.400]   Thereabouts.
[02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:56.120]   You can watch us do it live at twit.tv/live.
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:25:58.000]   There's live audio and video streams there.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.680]   If you're watching live, chat live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:06.200]   After the fact, the show will be made available for download
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:10.160]   from our website, as all our shows are, twit.tv.
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:11.560]   You can also find it on YouTube.
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:13.920]   There's a YouTube channel for this week in tech.
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:16.000]   Easiest thing to do, probably, is go to the main YouTube
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.920]   channel, which is youtube.com/twit.
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:19.920]   And then you'll find links, because every show
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:22.760]   has its own dedicated YouTube channel.
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:24.120]   So you'll find links to all of those.
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:25.600]   And you can subscribe.
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:29.560]   As the kids say, mash the subscribe button,
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:31.680]   hit the bell, something like that.
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:32.280]   That's correct.
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:33.320]   Is that right?
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:34.560]   I guess correct.
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:37.680]   Talk that YouTube lingo.
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:41.040]   Actually, the best thing to do is get a podcast application,
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:41.840]   subscribe.
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:45.240]   And if you do subscribe in your podcast, get an Ecamm.
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:47.160]   If you do some-- why is Ecamm there?
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:48.040]   I don't know why.
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:48.920]   Get Ecamm.
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:50.080]   And then get a podcast.
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:50.560]   There it is.
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:52.480]   And subscribe.
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:54.760]   If you subscribe, you'll get it automatically.
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:56.360]   You don't have to think about it.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:59.040]   That's nice for us and nice for you as well.
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:04.200]   And if your platform allows reviews, please leave us a nice review.
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:07.880]   I will thank you later.
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:09.440]   It's 8.30 in the morning in Sydney,
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:11.360]   so it's time to say goodbye.
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:12.760]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:13.960]   We'll see you next week.
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:15.360]   Have a great Easter.
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:16.720]   Another tweet is in the can.
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:17.720]   Bye bye.
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:19.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:21.000]   Do it on the Twitter.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:21.800]   Do it on the Twitter.
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:22.800]   All right.
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:24.720]   Do it on the Twitter, baby.
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:25.520]   Do it on the Twitter.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:26.520]   All right.
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:28.400]   Do it on the Twitter, baby.
