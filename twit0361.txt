[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   This week in tech show that covers your tech news and information.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And we've got a great little panel.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And I say little because it's a little smaller than it usually is today.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   We asked Adam Curry, turns out he's getting married today.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I don't understand how that happens.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But that's all right because we got Mark Millie.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   You're not getting married today.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Well, in a couple hours.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   In a couple hours.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Good. Yeah. Mark Millie is here.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Push it back.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   He's from Bloomberg, Bloomberg week.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I'm sorry. I can't help it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Every time I say Bloomberg, I just feel like Bloomberg.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It just rolls off the tongue.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Right off the tongue.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And also here Jason Heiner from the tech republic, techrepublic.com.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Hi, Jason.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Hey.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   He's in Louisville today.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   That's right.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   CBS Interactive is your official overarching moniker.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   But you're the editor in chief of tech republic.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I am.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I am indeed.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   We should give him a little credit for that too.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   That's something.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Did you start tech republic?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I did not start tech republic.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I was there from the beginning.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Yeah, you've been there for ages.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   For very early on.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Eleven years.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I like to say.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I never thought it would last this long or be this much fun.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Wow.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So yeah, I've been around.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   There's something about bloggers that are just, they're a little weird.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   They're a little different.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Is that not the case?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   A little weird.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   When you meet bloggers sometimes, you know, I think of people like
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400]   Errington, M.G.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.000]   Seagler, Robert Scoble, people who are really known for being bloggers,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   they're all kind of twisted.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You seem normal, Jason.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   How did that happen?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I'm not sure how really normal I am.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Stayed away from the Bay Area.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Maybe that's it.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   There's also the, what makes a good, and these are all the most successful
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   bloggers, what makes a really good blogger, is somebody who's kind of
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   obsessed and has to post like, I mean, look at somebody like M.G.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I don't know a lot of them in person, Scoble and M.G.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   They're always thinking about what's my next, I'm fine.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I got to file that.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I got to file that.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   M.G. is on vacation.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   They've been on vacation.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   They've been to the south of France.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   He's filing.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   He's battling.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   He is.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   He's in a fight.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Like M.G.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Take a rest.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Apparently, he tweeted, I made up stuff at TechCrunch as a honey trap to catch people.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I would make up, it's a short tweet.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I don't have to find it, but it's a very short tweet.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I made up facts.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And then somebody, we won't go into detail, but somebody writes a blog post
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   based on the whole thing.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Like M.G.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Sigler made up stuff.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And that means anything he says you can't trust.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And of course, M.G. gets in a big battle with this person.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   That's to me, that's what makes a blogger.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   It's somebody that's just like everything's personal.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Totally.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   It's hard to have to have an opinion about everything.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I have an opinion about everything.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   It started with Marco Arment of InstaPaper.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And he tweeted, he was talking about it.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So he wrote a blog post.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   He was the one who discovered, because it happened to InstaPaper, that App Store
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   binaries are crashing on launch.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Apple had trouble with its App Store.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Something was wrong with a server.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And a lot of applications, people would download the update.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And he said last night with a minute of Apple approving my 4.2.3 update of InstaPaper,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I was deluged by support email and Twitter messages from customers saying it crashed immediately
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   on launch, even with a clean install.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And so he was worried and so forth.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And it turns out it was an Apple server problem.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So he wrote a big long blog post.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And then as often happens in the blogosphere, everybody's got a file.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And he then kind of slammed a number of news outlets, like the next web.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   He slammed Gizmodo, he slammed the Verge.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   All for use, basically picking up his story without attribution.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Now you've both been on short leads.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You always have worked.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You worked for the late times CNN.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I'm trying to mark Millian and Bloomberg.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So you've always worked for mainstream media.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   They have different standards, I would imagine.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Yeah, I mean it varies from place to place, but at least at Bloomberg,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   the role is to attribute everything in Link.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Right.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Yeah, I mean if we didn't write the story, I mean I'm remembering to say it was reported earlier by X.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I'm trying to.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So whenever we do a story I say and Andrew Bochon is writing in Pointer talk,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   this is actually a good article at Pointer.org about this whole fuh-ra.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It's a little unusual though, especially for those sites and gadget in the Verge.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   They always put that, I mean it's sort of--
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   They'll sort it at the bottom.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   It's like at the very bottom that no one ever looks at.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It's like via the--
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   It's a little link.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I mean, I don't know if the Verge doesn't but in gadget does it terribly.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   They'll have a link to what they, you know, reported in somewhere.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And it's a link back to their own page.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's always links--
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yeah, because they cover everything.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Right, they never get back to the original.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's always more links to their sites.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I understand.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Page user are the currency here.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So, yeah, I don't-- I'm just looking at the tweet.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Mashable was decent, says Marco Armin, adding some original reporting.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Gizmodo only cites the Verge and the Verge, of course.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Got its story from Marco.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   So, MG Sigler responds, "They're friends.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I used to love the plant one really weird bit of random information, sometimes even false,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   into stories to catch the rewrites."
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Now, that, by the way, is something that map makers have been doing for centuries.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   You know, because you couldn't really--
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Maps were notorious for getting copied.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   So, they put a fake island or place or street.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I think they still do it in their maps.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And then if somebody else came out with a map the same thing, they'd look and see if that island
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   or street or place was there.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And if it was, you stole it.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So, it's a time-honored thing.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Although, you got to think in an article you probably shouldn't put falsehoods.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   So, then, Beta Beat, Adrian Jeffries in Beta Beat, and this was really what got MG upset.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Wrote a whole blog post, "Unreliable Narrators!
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   TechCrunch Blogger inserted random information, sometimes even false into posts.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Picture of MG."
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   From his LinkedIn.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Not a lot of original research.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   MG got all upset.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I mean, they at least reached out to him.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   He didn't respond right away.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   He was on vacation to some other people in the industry.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Just, this is to me part of what I love about the blogosphere, but also part of where it's kind of--
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   It's over heated, really crazy.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And it's because the cycles are so fast.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Yeah, I mean, I don't think most people outside of the industry--
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   It's just us.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We're leading with the story.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I don't think most listeners are--
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   You're right.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   All right.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Thank you, Mark Millian, for saying this story.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Not to shut it down.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   No, no, no, I shouldn't.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   But the Apple issue that sparked all of this is news.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I mean, Apple really downplayed this technical problem, which was completely on their end.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Developers submitted updates.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   They tried to put some DRM on it automatically.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Is that what happened?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Yeah, so they have this automatic DRM system that you submit an app update.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Their servers inject some code into it, and then it goes onto the store.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And that mechanism was failing for a little while.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And they really downplayed this in the statement to all things D that you just pulled up.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Inafried, who seems to have very good-- this is another thing.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It's all about your sources, right?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And INA has somehow become the-- Apple has some people they talk to, and INA is one of these people.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Yeah, all things D has a pretty good end.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   A good pipeline.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's an Apple.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Apple says it fixed server bug that led to crashing apps.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   "We had a temporary issue," Apple said.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   "That began yesterday with a server that generated DRM code from some apps being downloaded.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   The issue has been rectified.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   We don't expect it to occur it again."
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   It is really embarrassing, though.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Good reader was impacted, instant paper.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Because people assume that you did something wrong.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   It's your app that's crashing.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And a lot of customers were leaving one star reviews and kind of tanking.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Now, Apple said that they're going to let those review-- they're going to clear those reviews out.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   So we hope that they do that.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So they write, "That's the bigger story."
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   But I know MG, so I'm going to cover that one.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   No, it wasn't going there, but I just kind of-- we started talking about bloggers, and then that kind of--
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Oh, yeah, totally.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   It kind of came up.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   How do you handle that at Tech Republic, Jason?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I mean, there is a very intense-- is there a pressure?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Do you guys have pressure to be first?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   We don't.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I mean, again, TR is more-- Tech Republic is more trade public.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   So you don't have to worry so much.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Yeah, ZDNet now is news, and they're trying to get first all the time.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Right.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Larry Dignon talks about speed kills, right?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And he says that to everybody that--
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It's so easy to make mistakes if you're trying to rush that story out.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Yep.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   It's so hard.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Yep.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I'm reading Wasser Cronkite's "The Biography of Him" that just came out, which is great.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I highly recommend it by a guy named Brinkley, but not the same.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And they tell the story early in his career, who's working at a radio station in Kansas City, WMCO, or as a camcio.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And he-- the owner of the station's wife called and said, "There's been a terrible fire.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   The fireman had been killed."
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And the owner comes to Walter Cronkite, who is in his-- I think he's 18.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   He's very young.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   He's very young.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And says, "Walter, you got to go on the air immediately and report the story."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And Cronkite says, "I'm not going to say it unless I can confirm it."
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And he says, "The owner says, 'You have to say this.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   No, I have to confirm it.'"
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   He fought the guy.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   The guy went on the air himself, reported it.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   It turned out that it was a minor fire.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Nobody was hurt.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Nobody died.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It was completely wrong.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Cronkite was right.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Fires Cronkite the next day.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And yeah, isn't that?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   It's a great story from his early days.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And that's one of the things Cronkite was so famous for was, "I am going to fact check
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   this."
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Boy, we need that kind of standard today, I got to say.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I mean, he was the most trusted voice for many years.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And why do you think?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Because of that?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Isn't that a great way to start your career?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   19 years old.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   He's dropped out of college.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   He's working in radio.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And this was in the '30s.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   It's brand new.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Nobody-- there's no such thing as radio journalism.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   He said, "I'm not going to say it unless I can confirm it."
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   All right.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   So here's-- now I'm going to say a bunch of rumors that have no confirmation whatsoever.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   All right.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Loomer mill.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Let's start with the Bloomberg Business Week report.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.280]   Amazon, according to your colleague, Tim Culpin, Olga Karif, at Ashley Vance, planning a smart
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.000]   phone to buy with the iPhone.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   This is-- according to this story, Foxconn is working with Amazon on the device.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Of course, they're sourcing it on name sources.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Does Amazon really want to make a smartphone?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   They're making the Kindle, which has been a success, the Kindle Fire for them.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Do they want to compete with Apple?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   What do you think, Jason?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Yes.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   This is-- I totally believe that they are.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Or at least I would not be surprised if they are.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   And it makes sense in a couple ways.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And it doesn't make sense in a couple others.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   So obviously, it makes sense.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   They've set up the ecosystem, right?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Apps they have, they have content.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   That's what a lot of people are doing on these devices.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   They can do that stuff well.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   That's why a tablet made sense.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And they got off to a decent start with the Kindle Fire.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   But the thing is, is there's 10% or 20% of the things they're going to have to do really well
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   that are going to be just way out of their league, which is working with carriers.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Making sure that they have great call quality on these things.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Setting up a messaging infrastructure now, because like, you know, the sort of BBM,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   IMESSAGE kind of thing, you're going to have to have something along those lines, right?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   There's some third party they could promote maybe instead.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   But anyway, there's these things that they're going to have to do that are so tangential to their business model
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   and what they want to be about and being able to sell this device inexpensively
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   and basically just make money on the content.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   You know, that stuff is so out of their league.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And a tablet made a lot of sense because they could avoid most of that.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Once you get into a phone, you have to deal with all this other stuff.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And that I think could be a step too far for them.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Of course, I said that when we heard that Apple was going to do a phone,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I said, "Why would they want to get into that business?"
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Boy, was I wrong on that.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Well, I mean, they had some problems getting the innards right, the antenna working,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   and you know, the iPhone was a terrible phone for at least the first couple iterations
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   in making phone calls.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Yeah, and in fact, it was the relationships.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   They only had one carrier because they couldn't get the other carriers to take the iPhone
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   for Isaac, famously turned it down.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   There's something though that's new in the mix that is a big, big part of it,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   and your colleagues in Bloomberg point this out.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Now it's all about patents.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   You look at Samsung, Apple is just, you know, Apple has blocked the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Actually, that stay is temporarily lifted, but they've got a block on the Samsung Galaxy Tab.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   You've got Motorola suing Apple.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   If you don't have a patent portfolio, do you could, this is what's sad,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   because I'd love to see Amazon enter the fray.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I'd love to see some competition.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   I'd love to see some choice, but you can't because you'll see be sued out of existence
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   because you don't have the patents.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   It's a good point.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Yes, they are addressing that as was reported.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   They have made some patents in the small gadget space.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   One of the most interesting ones, which they won't be able to sue anybody over
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   because nobody is doing this right now, but they filed for a patent where if you drop the phone,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   a parachute comes out and Jeff Bezos is named on that patent.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   The only patent of that because the boss said, "Hey, I got a good idea."
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Instead of saying, "Boss, you're drunk."
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   They said, "Oh, yeah, right, Jeff? Good idea.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Let's patent a parachute for the phone."
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   What if you're in a plane and you drop it?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Amazon doing a phone, the best news might be for Nokia, or Blackberry, right, RIM.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Because those are both sitting on gold mines, two gold mines of mobile patents,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and both of the companies are looking increasingly unable to innovate their way
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   out of the funk that both of them are in, and that patent could be in a fire sale
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   for the best things they've got going on.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And Amazon can't afford to pick it up.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   They apparently, according to the article in Bloomberg, hired Matt Gordon,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   he was the senior director of acquisitions at Nathan Mirvold's patent troll company,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Intellectual Ventures.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   So this is a guy who specializes in acquiring patents for just this reason.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   That sounds like Amazon is interested.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   They do have patents.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   They have the one-click patent.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   I mean, that's a good patent.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   They've actually done that.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   I think they've done a nice job with that using it defensively, but not offensively,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   as they could against competing retailers.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Amazon has been involved in five patent-related cases this year and 20 last year.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Here's the other thing that could be a problem with the Amazon doing a phone is
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   the Kindle Fire sold like gangbusters out of the gates.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   But that thing has, sales of that thing has really fizzled.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And a lot of that has to do with people are not, a lot of people bought them
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   and aren't using them.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   As you can see, sort of the, if you look at usage numbers like browser usage numbers,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   there are not lots of Kindle Fire's connecting to the web.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And as large as numbers as there should be, considering how many were actually sold.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   And so you have this tablet that people aren't really using.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And so, I don't know, they're not setting the world on fire with the device that
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   they've got out there.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   And supposedly they have a 10-inch tablet or at least a revision to the 7-inch
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Kindle Fire or both in the pipeline.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And so this is one of those areas where they may be getting a little too big to,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   you know, stretching themselves too fast.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Because I think the Kindle Fire had a lot of potential.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   There's some interesting things with that.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   But they probably should focus on making that really good first before, you know,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   getting hot and heavy on the phone because that you're just going to introduce so
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   many more, so much more complexity to, and things are going to have to do well.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Here's the other interesting thing I thought about the Kindle Fire that's come up
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   with the Kindle Fire.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I think the Kindle Fire has sold as many ink kindles as tablets.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   As you look at the Kindle Fire, I've seen this a number of people look at the Kindle Fire
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   and they're asking themselves, "Should I buy this?"
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Because this is a real inexpensive tablet.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   They look at the Kindle Fire and then they say, "What do I want to do with it?"
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It's like, "Well, I want to read and then I maybe read some websites."
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And I just want to check some email once in a while.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   But, you know, it's like, "Okay, do I need to use this in full sunlight?"
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And it's like, "Yeah, I do."
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   And it's like, "Well, you know, for mail, I've already got a smartphone if I already
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   have a smartphone.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   I can check my mail on the smartphone.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   I can check a couple of websites there."
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I'm just going to get the regular Kindle because that makes sense.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I can just read on that thing.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I've seen at least about half a dozen people go through this.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   I want to say in the last couple months where they've, you know, we're thinking about the
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Kindle Fire and ended up getting the regular Kindle instead in almost every case.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   So, I think secretly this thing is actually helping them overall.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   It's bait.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   It makes 79 bucks that little ink Kindle is cheap.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It's effective.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Does everything you want?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Now, I got to say, in the next seven, Google's new seven-inch tablet's got to be a threat
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   to the Kindle Fire.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   It's the same price.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And it's better.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   It's faster.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   It's better.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   It's real Android, so you could put real apps on it.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   So, I think maybe Amazon, you ought to pay attention to keeping the fire up to date and worry
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   less about phones.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I think they just want to, you know, have a way to keep everyone within their ecosystem
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   as much as possible to--
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   That's what the fire was to do, wasn't it?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Oh, they're selling it at a loss as a core analyst.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And that's exactly what-- interestingly, Google's doing with its own Nexus 7.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Google says, "We don't make any money on it.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   It's all about the play store."
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   ASUS doesn't make any money on it.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Oh, Google money.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   That's right.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And Google doesn't make any money on Android for the most part at all.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   They don't need to.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   They don't need to.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   They make money on other stuff.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   But making a phone is really not that big a leap for Amazon.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I'm not worried about messaging infrastructure.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   They have some of the strongest server infrastructure of anybody out there.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And they're used by thousands of people.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   You talk about Whisper Net?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   No.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   You know, having the technical prowess to handle, you know, messaging and other things that
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   are required for having a phone, they also have a carrier relationship with AT&T for the
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   A-ing.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Whisper Net.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And so the PCs are there.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   They're not that big a network.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   That's the thing where if you read it on one, well, first of all, you can download it.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   You get 3G.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   But also, if you read it on one, it syncs up with the others.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   You pay a little extra out front for the device.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And you don't have to pay monthly fee.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Ever.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   So that's AT&T doing that.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   AT&T.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Interesting.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So I will go one more on the, you know, play devil's advocate on the other side of the one
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.200]   thing I think Amazon does have going for it, and why I do think they will eventually be
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   a player, you know, in the space, even if I think it might be a little early for them to
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.800]   go into a phone, is they are user experience Nazis.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.600]   I mean, they are so good at user experience.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.280]   You look at the site and they really still have the best and they don't get credit for
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.280]   it a lot.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.600]   The best e-commerce, you know, sales experience of any company on the web.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.160]   And really just one of the best user experiences of anybody on the web.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.240]   And I do think you're going to see them be able to transfer that to the device space
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.120]   and take some of the stuff they've done.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.280]   You know, you look at all the things that they've pioneered in terms of, you know, you
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   talked early about one click Leo, you talk about one click.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   Amazon Prime.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.960]   What a brilliant marketing thing that is.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.880]   I mean, it's a good user experience.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   All right.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.440]   I'm going to throw you a monkey wrench.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.360]   What if the Kindle Fire 2 is the phone?
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.160]   And what if it's not a phone?
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.760]   What if it's using 3G and Wi-Fi and Skype or something like it?
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.120]   Tango, let's say Tango, Skype's owned by Microsoft to provide phone-like service.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.400]   Maybe that's what they're talking about.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.400]   What about that?
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.080]   Would that be a good product?
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.120]   It would be disruptive.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.880]   I don't think they would have such a tight deal with Skype just because of the little
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   Microsoft tie up.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.800]   No, it could be Tango or something like that.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.520]   There's plenty of choice.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.960]   You know, I mean, Google Voice.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.920]   I'm using I got this little thing somebody told me about on the radio show called an
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.160]   OB.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   That's a little $40 box.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.200]   It lets me use Google Voice for my home phone.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   It's so great.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.360]   Now, I don't have to pay for anything ever.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.600]   Again, it's all free.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.960]   Thank you, Google.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   I don't know.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.560]   I think this is what I think maybe this is the Kindle Fire 2.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.360]   We're getting distracted by the phone part of it.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.120]   Maybe it's somebody I don't know.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.120]   I think you could do that.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.240]   I think I would I wouldn't be surprised to people using these inexpensive tablets as
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.840]   phones more and more.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.080]   What do you think?
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.560]   What are the next seven you put?
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.680]   With the Bluetooth headset or something?
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.360]   Yeah, you don't have to hold it up to your ear.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.440]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.640]   I did a story a couple of years ago about people using getting my files and using the
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:19.000]   iPod touch as sort of like a replacement, a cheaper iPhone.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.440]   But I had a lot of trouble finding people.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   Those people were weirdos.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.600]   They were weirdos and there aren't a lot of them.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   No.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   I just don't think.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   Well, let's all right.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.600]   I think the carrier's are going to do everything.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.320]   Let's talk about Apple.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.160]   The rumor the drumbeat is stronger and stronger for something that Steve Jobs said we will
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:40.680]   never ever ever in a million years ever ever ever make a seven inch iPad.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   Is it true?
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   We'll find out.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   I got some smart guys.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.600]   They're going to know Mark millions here from Bloomberg Business Week and also here.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.240]   I can't do that with tech Republic.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.640]   Tech Republic is Jason Heiner and you're watching Twit.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.640]   We're going to have more in just a moment.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.280]   If you missed anything, let's run the promo.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.640]   I want to run the promo off the top because I don't think anybody ever saw this last week.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.840]   We're going to start doing little short pieces of what you might have missed if you didn't
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.240]   watch Twit this week.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   This is Twit.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.480]   An official brotherhood of Metallica instrumental.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.160]   However, that is aggressive.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160]   That's Metallica.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.920]   That made me feel.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   I feel good.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.880]   Valve has released something called the Valve Source Filmmaker which allows you to make
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.800]   better machinima.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:35.240]   Every set will suddenly become playable levels for the video game spin off of this thing.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.760]   Google announced a new device called the Nexus.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   We have one here.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.760]   It's called the Nexus G.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.760]   Give me my regular hits.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.760]   It's a little over here.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.880]   Alright, now let's finish up with something light, particle physics.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.920]   Two boats crash into each other but you don't see them.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.600]   You don't know what the boats are.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.040]   15% of the time when two boats crash into each other you see a V-shaped wave, right?
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.080]   And if you see a V-shaped wave 45% of the time, the more data you have, the more certain
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   you are that a CDU was involved in the crash.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   That's somebody got drunk on a CDU.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   And ran into.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.800]   That's essentially what's going on with the Large Hadron Collider.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   Look at that!
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.560]   It's a brand new show on the Twit Network.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.560]   Hello, I has Ectar.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.880]   I'm glad to be here.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.600]   Oh, I am so excited about this show.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.360]   It's called KnowHow.dot.dot in each show.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.800]   We're going to show you how to do something.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.280]   Tonito and Pogo Plus both have apps for your phone.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.120]   For Android, iOS, I believe Tonito Plus has for Windows Phone 7.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.040]   They have lots of applications for accessing the stuff on the web.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.720]   Or you can just do it on your browsers.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   Now that you know how.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   Do it now!
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.960]   We'll see you next time.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.320]   We trained the audience for weeks.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:45.160]   So actually that was, if you missed the explanation of what the Higgs Boson Discovery was, Tom
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.600]   Merritt with his two boats colliding was probably the best I've heard.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.600]   Wow.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   That was...
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.840]   That KnowHow show looks good too.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.520]   I'll have to check that out, Liam.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.320]   I heard you're also doing an enterprise show.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   I want to check out this one.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.000]   We are with a priest.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.360]   Because we figure he can give the last rights to your server if he can't get it fixed.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.360]   It'll be perfect.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.160]   It's kind of a one-stop shop.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:13.960]   So this show brought to you by Squarespace.com, the secret behind fantastic websites.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   More and more people, I think you probably noticed, are using squarespace.com.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.360]   It's everything you need to create an amazing website.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.240]   If you visit squarespace.com, you'll see they make it very simple to find out what Squarespace
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.560]   has to offer.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.320]   They're triad free button there, that big green button that says, "Just try..."
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.600]   All you need, don't need to credit card.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.840]   All you need is a name for the site, a password, your email, and you're good to go.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.480]   You can use all of the features like the import tool that imports all of your content from
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.680]   the main APIs movable type WordPress type pad blogger.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.320]   You can see both web-based and mobile editing.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.880]   They've got an iOS and Android app that just makes it so easy not only to post content,
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.640]   but to moderate comments, to take a look at stats, to completely run your site from
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.240]   an iPhone iPad or an Android device.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.760]   Squarespace is really great stuff.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.360]   This is hosting plus the best software ever to make a great site.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   Not just a blog.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.280]   Look what the photographers are doing here.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.520]   Some of these photo sites are amazing.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.040]   No two Squarespace sites look alike, thanks to their very creative templating and the
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.480]   ease with which you can work on your site.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.000]   You don't have to be a CSS expert.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.880]   Now, of course, if you are, Squarespace has an amazing CSS editor, makes it very easy.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.880]   Here's the deal.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   Try it.

[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.920]   They've reorganized their pricing plan.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.920]   It couldn't be simpler.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.840]   $8 a month for the standard plan when you buy a year.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.200]   $16 a month for the unlimited plan.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.400]   The unlimited plan is unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage and a free custom

[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.440]   the custom domain.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.440]   That's nice.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.640]   So it's not, you know, your site at squarespace.com.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.800]   It's your site.com.

[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.320]   to know about it.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   It's really fantastic.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.200]   I've used those guys for two years.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   They're awesome.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   Really for your personal site?
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.840]   Yeah, JasonHiner.com.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:52.040]   I've used it for, it has saved me hours of, you know, site design.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   That kind of thing.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.280]   Also, it's saved me time from having to hire.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.240]   You know, I used to hire some web designers to help me out.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.080]   Saved me money and web design, actually in two years, I've played less to squarespace
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:10.760]   probably in two years than I did to designers like in, you know, past hate to say that.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   No, it's true.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.760]   Tell me about it.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.400]   It's, it's, it's been, it's awesome.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.400]   So, I mean, and the tools are so good.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.040]   It's saved me so much time in terms of building, you know, site building new pages, building
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.440]   galleries, all of that.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.320]   So I'm a believer.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.560]   You got a, you got a gallery here.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.560]   I like this.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.280]   This is a good idea of your, of your iPhone home screens and your.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.160]   I need to update them, but that's a great idea.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   So you can see the Apple.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.960]   What's on your, I think this is cool.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.960]   I've always liked this.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.000]   I've always been interested in what, what's on your home screen tells you a lot about
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.200]   somebody, what apps they use all the time.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   It's sure.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.480]   No, I noticed a squarespace app is number one on there.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.480]   That's good.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   It is on there.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.400]   squarespace.com use the offer code.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.320]   Oh, there's a Jeff Bezos is patent, by the way.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.120]   It is not a parachute.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.120]   It's an airbag.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   An airbag.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120]   Okay.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:04.080]   Well, a parachute, I think that'd be a little hard, but an airbag for you to play.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.240]   Now it must add considerably to the weight and the complexity of a smartphone to have
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.040]   an airbag.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.200]   Because by the way, you either you have an airbag on every side or you have built in
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.760]   jets to orient it.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:21.040]   And in fact, they've decided to have the portable device reorientation element to make sure
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.600]   that the phone comes airbags side down.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.280]   Otherwise, the airbag just fires it into the concrete.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.280]   That's no good.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.280]   It's true.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.880]   No, side impact airbag.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.160]   No, yeah, there's a propulsion element, an absorbing structure, a re-afor side and a
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.160]   spring.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.360]   I don't think.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   Wow.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.760]   This is a lot, man.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.600]   And I have the feeling that they will never really, I wish there were a picture though.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.160]   I like when there's the little diagrams.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.920]   I love the applications that have the little diagrams and they make for great, you know,
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.240]   there's figures, but it's not in this particular posting.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   Long document.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.440]   It used to be, this is where C software, this is good.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   This is a traditional patent.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.240]   I don't like software patents, but it used to be you'd have to bring a model to the patent
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.560]   office of your idea.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.080]   That's what, oh, here's the images.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.360]   Maybe we can see these.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   Oh, sweet.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.160]   Yeah, let's just see real quickly.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.120]   Oh, is it a video?
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   I don't know.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.120]   It's quick time.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.880]   That would be brilliant if there was a video.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.160]   28 pages of figures, but I don't, I'm not seeing anything.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.600]   Of course, this is the United States patent trademark office.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.040]   It looks there at their website was designed in 1985.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.120]   Is that, wait a minute, is that, is that comic sans on the left?
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.160]   I think it is.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.880]   Holy cow.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.120]   We have a comic sans sighting and a non functional site.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.520]   What a surprise.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.520]   That's it, isn't it?
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.480]   Full text help comics.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.560]   All it needs, the guy in the hard hat digging in an under construction site.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   Yes.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560]   Yes.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.240]   Can animate a gift with a mailbox opening and then it'd be, oh, then to be a perfect site.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.240]   Yeah, they need square.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.840]   These square space.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:07.000]   So Steve Jobs in 2011, 2011, call, it was early in the year, join an analyst call.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.720]   Normally jobs would not join analyst calls.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   Maybe you were on that call.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.880]   I was.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.800]   And he just kind of bursts in and says, hey, it's Steve Jobs here.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.600]   I just want to say one thing.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   He said a lot of things.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.920]   What did he say?
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.640]   He went on a long rant.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.640]   I don't remember.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.120]   I do remember specifically the tablet complaint.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:33.960]   I think he also took some knocks at rim and Nokia for having trouble in phones and not
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.320]   being able to get developers on.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   But the tablet in particular, he said seven inches is not big enough to do a good apps
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.120]   on a tablet.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.080]   He said that users would need to sandpaper their fingers down in order to use a seven
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.080]   inch tablet.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   I think we have audio.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.080]   I think I've got audio on my computer.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.080]   I don't know if you need.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.080]   Thanks Peter.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.080]   Hi everybody.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:03.160]   As most of you know, I don't usually participate in Apple's earnings calls since you're all
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.760]   in such capable hands with Peter and Tim.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.760]   But I'm pissed.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:11.280]   But I just couldn't help dropping by for our first $20 billion quarter.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.600]   I'd like to chat about a few things and then stay for the rest of the queue.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.600]   This is unheard of.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.840]   He never ever does this.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.040]   I want to find, I don't know where it was in the call where he was talking about later.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.240]   Yeah, this is a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:31.880]   Fourth, almost all of these new tablets use Android software.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:37.400]   But even Google is telling the tablet manufacturers not to use their current release.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.160]   Let's go a little bit back.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:46.680]   To me, when you hear a CEO call and an analyst call to go on and on about the competition,
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.040]   that's the kind of thing that tells you the competition's actually getting to them.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040]   Totally.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   You totally.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.960]   You physically place elements on a touchscreen before users cannot reliably tap, flick or
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.960]   pinch them.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:05.200]   This is one of the key reasons we think the 10 inch screen size is the minimum size required
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.440]   to create great tablet apps.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.920]   The minimum size required.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:15.880]   He said we will never use the word never make a seven inch tablet.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.440]   He also said they weren't working on a tablet when they were.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.240]   He said that they wouldn't do books because nobody really.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.760]   Nobody reads books anymore.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.360]   He also said that you'd never have video on a iPod screen because it's too small.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   I know, I know.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.560]   But this is a little different.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.600]   This is an analyst call.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   This isn't like some interview with the press.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.160]   This is making.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.160]   So here's the thing.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.600]   Now, I've seen a post, if I saw a post today that said, oh no, it doesn't mean that they're
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.120]   denying what Steve said.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.760]   It's just that Steve lives on.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:48.320]   The guy actually said in this post, if Steve were looking down from heaven, he'd be blessing
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.920]   the seven inch tablet.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.920]   I don't think so.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.880]   I don't think so.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.160]   I think it's much more likely.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.200]   This is Tim Cook saying, hey, Steve's gone.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.760]   It's my company.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.000]   We see the fire doing well.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.400]   Not that well.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.520]   I pad is still what 80 or 90 percent of the market, right?
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.480]   We were worried maybe a little bit about the Nexus seven.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.880]   I don't know.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.880]   Why is Apple?
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.240]   Why if Apple is indeed doing a seven inch tablet?
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.760]   And I'm not convinced they are.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.920]   Why are they Jason?
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.760]   One reason cost.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.960]   I think it's 350 bucks.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.240]   If they can sell a tablet at 300 to 350 bucks, then they would probably wipe up a lot of
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.200]   the rest of the tablet market.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.640]   I got to think that's the reason.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:38.960]   I also think that maybe the thinking is that there's some product for them that's kind
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.280]   of like a little bigger iPod touch where they can get five inches, seven inches, eight
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.840]   inches, and maybe they can take a lot of what they can migrate those people that were
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   buying iPod touches because a lot of those people, those iPod touches, the top end of
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.880]   that product was $400 at one point.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.080]   At the cheapest even, it's a lot of it's like $2.99.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.880]   I think it's like, can we take that market and migrate them to a tablet and keep cash
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.520]   and checks and basically not do anything different than we're doing with the iPad, the
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.520]   regular iPad?
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:18.680]   I think what if they're going to do this, they're going to make it the same screen kind of resolution
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.720]   to the apps essentially are the same.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.880]   Nobody has that.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.240]   Well, that's a good point because there's another thing Apple gets, hits Android about
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   as fragmentation.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.880]   There's too many screen sizes.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.880]   Even on that call.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.200]   So there's another good reason.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.760]   And so this would this, so you're saying, well, what will the resolution be the same as
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.760]   the iPhone?
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.760]   The old iPad.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.760]   1024 by 768.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   Right.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.760]   Yes.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.680]   Now, the Nexus 7 is 1280 by 720.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.440]   It's full HD res, or is that right?
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.440]   1280 by 720.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   This is 16 by 9?
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.440]   Yeah, 69.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.400]   So you're saying Apple make a square-ish one before three.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.480]   Well, they've always done the square-ish with the iPad with the iPhone.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.200]   But I think they'll do it so that they don't have to, so they're not fragmenting.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.200]   1280 by 800.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.560]   So they'll do it.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:13.800]   It's something like they'll do, like Mark said, the resolution of the old iPad so that all
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.760]   the apps that are tablet apps now, you'll be able to run them on the little one if they
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.760]   are doing a little one.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   So that makes sense.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.560]   So it's 1024 by 768.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.280]   It's the same size resolution as the iPad 1 and 2.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.640]   So all of those apps will work.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.840]   Any retinized apps won't work as well.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.880]   Well, I think the retin apps can--
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.880]   They'll scale down.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   They'll scale down.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   Because it's half-- it's one half.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:43.040]   What about Steve's complaint that the icons in this text is too small?
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.040]   You have to--
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.040]   I mean, it's on the iPhone.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.040]   I never got that from the beginning.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.040]   It's not like people aren't doing it on the iPhone.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.040]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   The apps on the iPhone.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.040]   Actually made no sense.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.040]   There you go.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.640]   That just shows you the reality distortion field.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.880]   That made no sense what he said.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.080]   I mean, he did say tablet apps.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   So OK, fine.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.920]   You know, the apps are a little better.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.640]   So many of the apps on the phone are on the phone.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.160]   It's not like a lot of these apps are tablet only.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.240]   They're also their iPhone plus tablet.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.240]   There are a few that are handful that are tablet only.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.080]   But most of these are-- they're in two sizes, right?
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:26.360]   And a lot of them are great on the iPhone, or at least almost as good on the iPhone.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.960]   So you guys sound like you're pretty convinced that this is going to happen.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.280]   I was skeptical for a while.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.120]   My colleagues just reported something last week, and their sources are solid on that
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:42.040]   one, that Apple is doing a tablet and planning to release it.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.680]   And it's going into manufacturing seven to eight.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.640]   Sounds like both in Brazil and China.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.400]   Foxconn, but also Brazil.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.440]   That's what Mac Rumors is saying, or Mako Takara.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.680]   And you know why they do it in Brazil?
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.200]   Apple has a big iPad plant in Brazil too, because the taxes are cheaper.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.440]   If you sell it in Brazil, Brazil puts a huge tariff if you make something outside of Brazil.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.440]   Foxconn has factories in Brazil.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.840]   So maybe it is Foxconn, but Foxconn, Brazil.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.360]   I mean, just think if they sell this thing at $199, and you're a consumer that's not
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.600]   sort of ecosystem tied, right?
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.800]   If you're not already sort of locked down in one of the ecosystems, and you have to choose
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.200]   between the Nexus and the iPad, what are you going to choose, right?
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.760]   A lot of them are going to choose iPad.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   It's from name recognition trust.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   Absolutely.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.760]   Absolutely.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:35.840]   So I just think if they know that they don't want people nibbling at the bottom of their
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.120]   market share, and they can do it.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:45.520]   They could sell it in $199 and still make a pretty good, or maybe $249 and still make
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.720]   pretty good money on it.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.680]   So I think it probably, it makes sense from a business perspective.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.080]   You got to add the Apple text though.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.960]   So you're competing with $200 products, so you can sell it for $300.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.800]   True.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:05.160]   They wouldn't do what Amazon did or what Asus and Google is doing and sell it at loss.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.640]   I don't see that ever happening.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:13.920]   However, Apple with its giganticness can undercut everybody because they buy memory.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.800]   They buy everything in bulk, and they have some of the best deals than any of their competitors
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   in the industry.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:25.160]   When Microsoft announced their surface, they couldn't make it out of aluminum because Apple
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.400]   had purchased all the aluminum in the world.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.400]   So they went with magnesium.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   Totally.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   They bought all the aluminum.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.400]   Yeah, I'm sorry, Steve.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.400]   They bought all the aluminum.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.400]   Well, what else is there?
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   There's magnesium.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.400]   Okay.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   Let's do that.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   Let's do that.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.600]   It's the same stuff that you use to make road flares.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.000]   That shouldn't be a problem.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.600]   It'll be fine.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.640]   What Mark's talking about is the dirty little secret of this whole thing.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:59.760]   It's that Apple has such an advantage because of all the RAM and the flash that they buy.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:05.800]   They are so far ahead on profit margin of all these other companies because of that.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.680]   The exception to Samsung, because Samsung builds their own stuff.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.000]   They're getting it at cost, but they're still selling it to themselves in a sense.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.200]   Because it's one division to the other.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:22.080]   But Apple, other than Samsung, Apple has this huge advantage.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.240]   It really is the reason why Microsoft had no choice but to make their own tablet.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:31.480]   Because if they were anything that HP, I think they saw the writing on the wall, anything
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.800]   that HP or Dell and anybody was going to sell, even if it was similar to the iPad, it was
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.720]   going to be $600 at least.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.080]   There is no way to get around it because of the Windows tax that they were going to
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.680]   have to pay on top of it, plus the fact that they were not going to be able to buy all
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.480]   of these things in huge quantities.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:54.640]   Even guys like HP and Dell that buy, already buy in plenty of this stuff on their own.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:00.280]   They're just not buying it anywhere near the kind of quantities that Apple is.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.200]   It sets them up for such an advantage.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.440]   Even at $249, they're going to be making a lot more money on this thing than those other
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.440]   guys are at $199.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.240]   Let me ask the chatroom, you guys are going to buy if Apple makes a 7.6-8-inch tablet,
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.160]   which everybody, including Bloomberg and all things D, seems convinced they're going to
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   make.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.760]   Would you buy it or would you, especially if it were 50, let's say 50 bucks more, let's
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.760]   say it's 250 or 300.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.320]   I see a lot of nose.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.320]   Yes, no, no, no.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.320]   Mostly no.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.320]   Would you buy the Nexus 7?
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.320]   I bought the Nexus 7.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.160]   It's not, you know, I wish the screen were a little bit better.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.400]   250 bucks, yes.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.400]   I already have one.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.400]   That's one of them.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   Okay.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   A lot of nose.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.880]   These people aren't buying anything.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.440]   Yeah, mostly nose.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.440]   We'll see.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.440]   I don't know.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.720]   Traditionally, and this might be something new.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.120]   This might be the, it is the Tim Cook era, but traditionally Apple does not even look
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.400]   at what the competition is doing.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.400]   They don't chase the competition.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.880]   You know, you see that now so much.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:59.240]   Microsoft, you know, afraid of Apple, Facebook, afraid of Google, Google, afraid of Facebook.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.640]   They all seem to, you know, Facebook buys Instagram for a billion dollars, not because
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.320]   they want it, because they're afraid somebody else will get it.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.800]   Apple's never done that.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   All defensive moves.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.400]   Yeah, Apple never is on defense.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.360]   It never, and they never feel like they're on defense.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.360]   They always feel like they're on offense.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.720]   So isn't it a defensive move to make a seven inch tablet?
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.280]   It is, but it's Steve Jobs isn't in charge anymore.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.880]   Yeah, it's a different world.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.000]   And of course, when we'll talk about lawsuits, I do want to, there are a couple of other
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.240]   Apple stories that are a little upsetting to me.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:36.680]   One is Apple is getting out of the EP, the EPA's environmentally friendly program.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:41.160]   Apple was one of the companies involved in creating the EP standard with the federal
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:48.600]   government and the EPA for easily recycling and energy efficient electronics.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.440]   Apple is now pulling all 39 of its products from the EP certification.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.280]   Now iPhone and iPad never were because they were glued together.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.640]   You could not recycle them.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.120]   They were not recyclable.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:06.440]   And the speculation is that it's the retina display MacBook that's to blame because it's
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.960]   all glued together.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.200]   The glass on the screen is glued to the back.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   The batteries are glued in.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.760]   You cannot recycle these without special tools.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.400]   And I just think this is, you know, I understand they did it because the market demanded it.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.400]   We want thinner.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.400]   We want lighter.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.880]   We want better.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.680]   But do we want it at this kind of a cost to the environment?
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.040]   And I think it's kind of a shame that Apple has decided to pull out of these environmental
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:38.320]   standards and make what is basically unrecyclable hardware.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.600]   Do they offer sort of, I know they did this with the iPad.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.320]   You could bring an old iPad in and they donate it.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.880]   Apple, Apple, I don't know about the donation, but you know, you pay it a recycling fee whenever
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.640]   you buy an Apple product.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.440]   And in theory, when you bring it to Apple, they recycle it.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.920]   Now this is, I don't think Apple wants to withdraw, but I think that they've made a
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.920]   decision here.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:03.480]   You know, the US government rules require 95% of the electronics it buys to be EP certified.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.880]   So that's, you're losing a huge government market.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:12.000]   Many companies forward HSBC and Kaiser Permanente require that their CIOs purchase computers
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.080]   from EP certified sources.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.960]   So you're cutting off a big market by doing this.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:24.520]   It's pretty clear that Apple has decided more important that we make thin, beautiful stuff
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.280]   than we worry about this recycling.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.000]   And I think it's a little disappointing.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.480]   It's a bad business move long term.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.160]   I just, I'm just disappointed.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.000]   I expected better.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.960]   So you know, they make a big deal.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   Steve Jobs would always do this.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.280]   Oh, we're mercury free.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.760]   We're going to EP, you know, we're blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   And they actually showed that card at the show on the right now.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.160]   Yeah, at the last, yeah.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   I'd love to hear their response to this, but it sounds to me like.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:56.360]   So I don't think they'll, they'll stop saying that they're an environmentally conscious
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.760]   company and all that.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.600]   But on the other hand, you know, are they?
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.080]   Well, are they is a question a lot of people have been asking, but when you go to buy advice
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.160]   or you're researching on your computer, do you look to see whether it's EP certified?
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.440]   I think that's what they're saying.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.360]   I almost had never heard of this before.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.360]   Right.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.600]   This is an actually what they're saying.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.800]   And they're going to still say green because it's a meaning, if you don't have a standard,
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.840]   it's meaningless and they can say it.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.160]   There is no green standard.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.640]   There's an EP standard and they don't want to adhere to that.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.000]   I think it's a shame.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.040]   I do think it's a, what I said, it's a bad business move is, you know, companies like
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.400]   Ford, I was actually just at Ford a couple of weeks ago.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:39.440]   They're like doing, they're ready to do iPad deployments and stuff like that.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.240]   You know, you also have companies in Europe and Asia, you know, they, they actually care
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.120]   a lot about this stuff.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:51.080]   And I think you're going to see more of them partly for, you know, for reasons of self
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:56.040]   preservation, you know, those are areas where it's, it's more people densely populated.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.320]   And so some of these things have real consequences, right?
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.040]   For drinking water and other things.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.600]   And so they really care about these kinds of standards.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:11.320]   And so, you know, Apple, I think, you know, may rethink this at some point.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.720]   I just can't see them not having to rethink this.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:18.760]   And I say this is somebody who bought the now not recyclable iPad, not recyclable iPhone
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.400]   and not recyclable MacBook retina display.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.120]   Yes, chlorine gas is green.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.560]   It makes you green too.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.400]   Somebody in the chat room mentioned energy star, which has, you know, made a bigger name
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.760]   for itself, I think.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.880]   But energy stars also from the EPA.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:39.240]   EP was created with the electronics industry for it's a standard for recyclability.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.880]   Energy stars are standard for low energy consumption.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:42.880]   Right.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.280]   But energy star is something that more people pay attention to than EP.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.800]   Well, probably right.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.960]   I think you're right though, Mark.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.320]   There probably aren't a whole lot of people that look and say, oh, this thing doesn't
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.480]   have an energy star or an EP on it.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.840]   It's like I'm going to go buy the Nexus 7 instead.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:59.880]   It's not a great name.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.000]   The marketing, I mean, it's got a marketing problem.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:12.680]   One other negative about Apple, the first malware to hit the iOS app store, a program
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:18.760]   that's available on both Android and iOS called Find and Call.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.520]   It was secretly harvesting data from the user's address book.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:27.080]   It's a Russian company only available in the Russian apps, Google Play Store, but available
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.280]   globally on the app store.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:34.480]   The app would send information to the developer's server, which would then spam users with
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.280]   text messages, getting a lot of spam text.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:42.600]   Maybe that's why it advertised itself as a tool for a good thing in simple-flaying
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.520]   context.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.520]   And it's a Trojan.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.520]   It's a Trojan.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.640]   The developer in a statement to appleinsider.ru said, hey, you spoke.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.080]   We had a process of fixing.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.480]   Mus and Squirtle are fixing now.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   No worry.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   Says Natasha.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.720]   That's, you know, it's not a surprise.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.360]   You cannot, when you have that many apps, you cannot really reasonably review them all.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.600]   It's still a pretty good record that Apple has in the iOS store.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   All right.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.400]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:23.520]   More Google shutdowns, some good news if you want to get Windows 8 and Microsoft taking
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.840]   a $6.2 billion right off on a recent acquisition.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:31.160]   We also have some wild stuff, Louis C.K.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.960]   Some good news from Louis C.K.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.600]   And a 32-year-old who was having a conversation via video with his 12-year-old stuff.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.320]   I love, did you see that video yet?
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   Wow.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.560]   We'll show you that.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.720]   And the end of the line for Thunderbird, which kind of shocked me.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.920]   But first, I want to tell you how you could stop going to the post office.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   How about that?
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.680]   When do you like to do that with stamps.com?
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.960]   I've talked about stamps.com before.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.200]   I've been using stamps.com.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:01.400]   I think since they started, I know for a very long time.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.680]   And we use it here all the time because it's a great thing for a small business.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:07.400]   You don't have to have a postage meter anymore.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.320]   You don't have to go to the post office and wait in line to buy stamps.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.120]   You just print your postage with your computer and your printer.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.120]   And you don't need anything special.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.120]   You just need stamps.com.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.120]   Now, you could try.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:20.040]   We got a no-risk trial for you to give you a chance to see what it's like.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:25.800]   Now, when you go to this page, stamps.com, you notice it says special offer $80 value.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.800]   Click the radio microphone.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.760]   There's a little old-fashioned fin microphone on there.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:35.280]   And when it asks you for the promo code, just put TWIT.
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.280]   Put Twit in there.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.280]   Watch this.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.920]   My happy face pops up.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.720]   It's a picture of me with brown hair.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.760]   Where the hell did they get that?
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.240]   And you know this.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.920]   That's when Harzley Miner and I were planning to take over the internet.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.200]   And that's actually probably when I started using stamps.com.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   And we changed that $80 value into a $110 value.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   That's $55 in postage coupons you can use over a few months.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.040]   It's a free digital scale you just pay shipping, handling at least $5 for that.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.000]   You get a supply kit, $5 supply kit to make up for that.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.640]   And a four-week trial of stamps.com.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.200]   Now, whenever you got a mail something, you just pop it on the scale.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.600]   It prints out the postage you can buy.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.200]   If you like sticky stamps, you can buy the forms for the sticky stamps.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   But you don't have to.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.200]   You can print it right on the envelope.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   It looks good.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   It looks really pros.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.640]   Have your company logo if you want.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:32.080]   They also will print on piece of paper you could put on a package.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.080]   And oh, this is cool.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.080]   They're doing international emailing.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.760]   They'll do the international postage and even print out all the forms automatically.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.640]   If you're an eBay or an Amazon seller, it will take the data from the eBay and Amazon
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   pages and give you the mailing address, everything you need.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.200]   If you use QuickBooks, it'll do your invoices and take all the information from QuickBooks
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   directly.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.360]   I mean, it really is more than just postage.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.960]   It's like it's an automation system.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.160]   It's really great.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.160]   We love stamps.com.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.160]   We know you'd like to try it.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.600]   That's why we gave you this special deal.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.960]   A $110 bonus offer.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:05.440]   You get the scale, you get $55 in free postage and a four-week trial at stamps.com.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.880]   Remember to click the microphone and use the offer code TWIT to get that extra special
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.880]   offer from stamps.com.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.320]   All right.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.560]   Moving on.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.280]   I like this Louis C.K.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.000]   Who has really used his cloud as a great comic.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   He's so fun.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.840]   I've been watching the second season of Louis.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:28.840]   That is wild.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.840]   The third just started.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.840]   No, I'm catching up.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.840]   It's on Netflix.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.840]   It's so good.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:33.840]   Isn't he good?
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:34.840]   He's breaking the barriers.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:35.840]   That's what I like.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.600]   It's not like TV you ever saw before.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.520]   It's just totally...
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.800]   There's a cringe in every episode, isn't there?
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.320]   There's a moment in every...
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.320]   Oh!
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.320]   Ah!
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.320]   Ooh!
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.080]   But it's real.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:53.880]   Anyway, so Louis C.K., he sold a concert online to tickets direct.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.040]   Now he's fighting ticket scalping.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:03.000]   He sells... There's a huge problem with... And if you've ever been to a recent concert,
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.800]   you can always go to StubHub or somewhere and get tickets for five times the face value.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   There's people... So he decided, "I'm not going to sell tickets through the standard ticket
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.240]   master or whatever it is."
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:17.760]   He's selling the tickets himself and he's putting this on the page.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:24.000]   He's saying, "If you try to sell a ticket anywhere for anything above the original price,
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.520]   we have the right to cancel your ticket.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.520]   We'll give you your money back.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.440]   We're going to cancel that ticket."
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:32.280]   This is something I intend to enforce.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:36.520]   He doesn't... He says, "This is to keep people from just buying the ticket and just flipping
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:40.240]   it for twice the price from a thousand miles away."
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.240]   What's the result?
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.240]   Fantastic.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:47.040]   He's sold 135,000 tickets to 67 shows.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.240]   He says that he has cut scalping over to over 96%.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:55:03.040]   He says, "Of the 135,000 tickets he's sold, there are very few tickets on less than 500
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:09.760]   available on all scalper sites for more than the face price."
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.760]   Wow.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:11.760]   That's just fantastic.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.760]   Wow.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   Good for him.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   I love this guy.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.880]   By the way, $6 million in tickets.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:23.880]   He can buy that $7 million Greenwich Village apartment that he was looking at.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.640]   That's a good episode.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   That was a good one.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.640]   He's looking at his beautiful apartment.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.640]   He's living in a dump.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   He's looking at his beautiful apartment.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.640]   He asks the figure.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.640]   He says, "How much?"
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.640]   He says, "7 million."
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.640]   He goes, "Okay.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   I'll be back."
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:43.720]   I feel bad for Best Buy cutting 650 Geek Squad employees.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.640]   Moving on.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.640]   Closing stores.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.640]   Thunderbird.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.960]   They're not going to update it anymore.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.200]   That's the Mozilla Project's great email program.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.160]   They say, "It's already perfect."
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:01.200]   We don't need to do anymore.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.600]   We're going to take all the developers off.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.960]   We'll keep giving you security fixes.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.760]   Sort of like what they did for Dig, right?
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.760]   It's like Dig.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.760]   Took all the developers off, sent them somewhere else.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   It's not gone.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:18.160]   We're just not going to do anything.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:22.080]   Is it JB, Placentino?
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:26.760]   The Thunderbird managing directory said, "We're not stopping Thunderbird.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.960]   Just proposing we adapt the Thunderbird release and governance model in a way that allows
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:34.280]   both ongoing security and stability maintenance as well as community driven innovation and
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   development."
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.880]   We're not going to staff it, but if you want to fix it, you can.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:43.800]   You know when I read more into this than that, they don't want to do that anymore?
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:48.000]   It's almost people are saying, "Who uses an email client anymore?"
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.840]   I mean, absolutely.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.800]   That was my first reaction to this story.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.040]   It was like, "Wow.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:58.640]   Are there that few people using email clients anymore?"
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.000]   Because I still know people.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.240]   I know I have one friend that is all about Thunderbird.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.720]   He's still feeling like I'm making it.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.720]   Oh, it's a great program.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.720]   I'll leave anything in the cloud.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:08.400]   I want to download my stuff.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.400]   I'll back it up myself.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.400]   I'm not.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.840]   I sort of am all about Gmail.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:15.840]   Gmail's.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.360]   Well, that's what I'm thinking is that, and in fact, I think they even mentioned this,
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.440]   people just using the web interface to Gmail or Hotmail or Home Mail, whatever they're
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.440]   using.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.400]   The other piece is how do you make money from a mail client?
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.400]   Unless you sell it up front, which Mozilla doesn't do.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:33.080]   I mean, with Firefox, they make a ton of money from the Google search referrals.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.560]   Well, put a little of that in a Thunderbird then.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.560]   Search Google search in Thunderbird?
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.560]   No, no.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.960]   I don't know the money they're making on it into Thunderbird.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:42.960]   I don't know.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   I guess you're right.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:47.240]   It's not a profitable enterprise.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.440]   I don't know how you would make money on it.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.440]   But they could.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.040]   I mean, it's an open source project.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.960]   They could at least, I mean, I guess it's still hanging out there.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.160]   I presume it's still open.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.800]   And if somebody wants to develop it, they can.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.800]   Of course.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   They develop they can.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.880]   So latest on the Galaxy Nexus band, they were selling it, then they weren't now.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.920]   They were selling it again on play.google.com.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.000]   This is because the app.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.200]   So Apple went to a court saying there are four patents that the Galaxy Nesys, and they've
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.960]   also do this with the Samsung Galaxy S3, violate.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:26.040]   There's the slide to unlock patent.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.040]   There's the tapping.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.240]   They call it data tapping patent.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.960]   That's what the Fospatence formula calls it.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.840]   Where if there's a link to an email or website or a phone number in an email, you can tap
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.840]   it and it will call the phone number or launch the browser.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:41.400]   That's Apple apparently owns that.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:46.160]   The big one though, and the one that the judge kind of bought into was this 604 patent that
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.480]   lets the user execute a search, goes out to multiple pages, looks for the results and
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:56.400]   combines the results back into a single page.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.200]   And really, I think that's the Siri thing.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.960]   I think that's really what Apple's trying to protect because Google, on both these phones,
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.160]   has this Google voice search capability.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:12.080]   And I think that's what, anyway, the judge said, yeah, okay, that does.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.080]   That's the one.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:15.560]   There's others, but that's the one.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:22.440]   And we are going to issue an injunction that you cannot sell this phone in the US.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:28.520]   Apple posted or was going to post or asked to post $96 million bond to make that injection
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.520]   in effect.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:33.720]   And now the appeals court has said, no, Google appealed and said, wait a minute, we're going
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.040]   to look at this.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.240]   So you can temporarily, at least by the Galaxy Nexus, this is a, this is a bitter fight.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:47.440]   The court, however, said, no, you can still ban the Galaxy tab 10.1.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.280]   So Google has put the Nexus back in.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:50.280]   What do you guys think?
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.040]   I've talked enough about this on a Mac break weekly and elsewhere.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.040]   I mean, give you go.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.040]   What about you, Jason?
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.840]   What do you think of this litigate, not innovate?
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.920]   Yeah, I hate all this patent stuff.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.760]   I do a daily email every day where I select the top stories of the day.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.720]   And I almost always try to not select patent stories.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.880]   It's like, I hate, I don't even want to talk about it.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.880]   I agree.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:10.880]   Exactly.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.440]   But you have to because here you go.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.720]   Apple has effectively said no one can buy this phone in the United States.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.640]   That seems to me, boy, that is a draconian solution.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.640]   It is.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.960]   And so I know somebody that came up to me, a good friend last week and was saying, he
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.280]   actually told me about the stories.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.280]   Like I just heard about this, this patent ban thing.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   He's like, I need to buy the GSM version of the Nexus because I'm about to change jobs.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.800]   And I'm not going to be able to get it because of this craziness.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:46.440]   So I think that it really brings up two questions for me, the whole Galaxy Nexus thing.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:51.680]   One is, is Apple still going thermonuclear on patents?
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.920]   Because Tim Cook has kind of talked, has sort of soft-pedaled some of this stuff.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:02.400]   And given the impression like he's not real crazy about all of the patent war stuff.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.000]   He doesn't, you just really get the impression that he doesn't think it's all that good for
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.560]   Apple long term.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:17.280]   But there are these sort of, you know, hound dog lawyers that Steve Jobs hired and said,
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.360]   you know, go nuclear.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.080]   And a lot of this stuff has been in motion.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.480]   And is it just that, you know, does Cook not crazy about it or telling him not go after
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.480]   new stuff?
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.840]   And this is just residual, you know, cases that have been in the courts for a while.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.760]   I'm just trying to figure out what Apple stances on this, the whole patent thing.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.000]   And it's a little unclear to me.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.520]   The other thing is that Google is, are they still this vulnerable?
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.560]   I guess this isn't Google.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.560]   It's more Samsung.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.800]   Well, but it's ultimately, look, this is Android.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.800]   They're going right.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800]   It's Android, right?
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.800]   Android's the problem here.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.640]   Is Google still this vulnerable?
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.040]   I mean, they've bought Motorola.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.880]   They've got all these patents from Motorola.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.880]   Which is by the way, suing Apple.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.920]   Yes, which is suing Apple.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:08.000]   And Motorola has just a wonderful patent, you know, collection.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.120]   I mean, they've got great stuff in there.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:16.040]   So it just brings up a lot of sort of sticky questions to me is, you know, where all of
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.480]   this stands, is this sort of the last gasp of some of the stuff that was put in motion
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.920]   by Steve Jobs?
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:30.000]   Or are these cases starting now to come to fruition, this sort of global thermal nuclear
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.360]   war that, you know, Jobs talked about that he was going to be doing with with Android?
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.880]   And it's just, I don't know, it's unclear to me.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.600]   Is this the beginning or is this the last gasp of sort of some of that stuff that was
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   in play?
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   Maybe you guys have thought.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.800]   What's your summary?
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.880]   On Tip Cook in particular, I don't get the impression that he's as religious about it
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.240]   as Steve Jobs was.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:58.440]   Although in interviews, he does say along the lines of we, you know, we welcome competition.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.320]   We just want people to invent their own stuff.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.200]   Come on, slide to unlock.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.000]   Come on, really?
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.720]   And is it even slide to unlock or don't they use like the sort of like bubble that you've
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.720]   moved?
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   No, yeah.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   I mean, it's very, it's not the same.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.720]   It doesn't say slide to it.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:19.080]   You know, they're going to reissue the Nexus with a with a firmware update that they claim
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.800]   will get him off the hook and all of this stuff.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.200]   Mike Allen, we tried to get Mike on.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.760]   I think he's out of town today.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.080]   Wrote a piece for the Cult of Mac.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.880]   He's talking about the boycott Apple movie because that's one of the responses to this
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.320]   is in fact, it was a trending topic on Google plus all last week.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.440]   He says, by the way, who cares?
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.440]   These people weren't going to buy Apple product anyway.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.280]   And he's probably right.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:46.920]   But he says, the reality is Apple doesn't sue or Apple's suing because they think they
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920]   can win.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   They say, this is what every company does when a company thinks it doesn't cost them
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.920]   much.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.160]   They've got lawyers on retainer anyway.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.480]   It's a few million dollars.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.920]   Apple's been sued in the past by Nokia, which won.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.480]   Nokia's suing Google and Asus.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.800]   Microsoft got Motorola devices banned in the US for an infringing patents publicly held
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.120]   companies, he says, pursue their own interests and the interests of their shareholders.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:17.080]   The truth is patent lawsuits are trivially inexpensive for big companies to pursue compared
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.600]   with the potential benefits.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.520]   There's no downside to suing over patent infringement if you think you might win.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.960]   He basically says it's their fiduciary responsibility.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.960]   They're a publicly held company.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.960]   They got a sue.
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.480]   They have no choice.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.120]   This isn't about nuclear warfare.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.720]   It's just what companies do.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.440]   It doesn't really affect customers all that much, does it?
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.640]   I mean, the Nexus was unavailable for what, like five days?
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.000]   Well, it could be unavailable again.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   Right?
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.400]   You can't buy a Galaxy Tab 10.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:51.560]   You know, when it's not available on shelves for another five-day period, then you won't
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.560]   win.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.760]   You know, it's funny because Apple tried to shut down the Galaxy S3, which would have
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.320]   been, I think, much more painful for the same sum.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.400]   It came out pretty recently.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.800]   And for users, it's a great phone.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   It's my phone.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.800]   I love it.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.320]   I would be very, very pissed off.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.640]   And the judge said, "Well, you got to pick because I can't hear all these cases.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.880]   So which one do you want me to go after in Google?"
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.760]   Or Apple said, "Oh, go after that one."
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.760]   And so they went after the Nexus.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.280]   But had they gone after the S3, you might have heard a little howl.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.280]   Right?
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.160]   But the S3 now, I mean, they did get Apple, right?
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.960]   They got it slowed up in customs.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.120]   And same thing with some of the HTC devices.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.280]   HTC is actually the one that's probably, I think, HTC.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.280]   HTC is in more danger than Samsung long term because they don't have as much.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.280]   J.C.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.280]   Calhoun and our chatroom said a great thing.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:45.360]   Can you imagine the uproar of Google got an injunction banning the sale of an iPhone?
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.320]   Now what would you say?
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.080]   Everybody's waiting for the iPhone 5 anyway.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.840]   What if Google, what if Google, I mean, I'm sure Motorola is probably contemplating such
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.440]   a suit.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.360]   What Mike's point is, and I think I do agree with him on this completely, he says, "This
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:04.760]   all diverts opposition from the real problem, which is a broken patent system."
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.720]   And this I think we'd all agree on.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:11.280]   These suits are there perhaps for good reason, but they wouldn't be there at all if we didn't
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.120]   have software patents.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.280]   We should not have them.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.920]   This cost of $29 million direct, I'm sorry, $29 billion last year in direct costs.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.560]   Patent trolls are killing innovation.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.960]   It's the patent system that's broke.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.640]   We should all be fighting that.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.800]   Because every company, not just Apple, every company's suing every other company.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.960]   You might as well just assume that.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.520]   The hip monk, this is one that kills me.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.520]   I love hip monk.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520]   You ever use hip monk?
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.040]   Great travel site.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.720]   Nice guys.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.720]   Good product.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.440]   It's cute.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.760]   They really bootstrapped this up.
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.800]   They just got $15 million in venture capital.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:54.080]   The day after, a patent troll called I2Z technology told hip monk it has to buy a license for
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:02.400]   a 1994 patent that covers a method for displaying data in multiple windows on the computer.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.760]   It's a Texas shell company.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.840]   It's run by a California lawyer.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:11.240]   They've already gone after kayak, Google, Yelp and Microsoft.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.280]   They waited until hip monk got its venture capital.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:21.440]   Then they said, oh, by the way, and it's cheaper just to pay these guys, isn't it?
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:28.280]   By the way, this patent sounds a lot like the Apple patent that the judge liked in the case
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.960]   against the SAMS against the Nexus.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:35.720]   A method and system for synchronizing the presentation from different but related sources
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.200]   in different windows of a computer display.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.200]   We got it.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.200]   You know what?
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.200]   Let's fight this.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.200]   I really hope there's more to it than that.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.200]   I mean, but.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.200]   There's not.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.640]   This is the broken software patent system in a nutshell.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.640]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:57.800]   I'm not a lawyer, but I was also told that getting a patent really isn't the key step.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.800]   The key step is defending the court.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:04.680]   The way the patent inspectors act is, well, yeah, we'll give you a patent.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.200]   And if it's no good, the courts will decide.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.440]   They just kind of, but the fault is, yeah, yeah, you got a patent.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:16.040]   Go ahead and sue the whole thing is set up for these kind of cases.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.560]   Apple by the way, as a patent, did you know this on water detection?
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560]   Water damage detection.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.200]   Oh, yeah, they have those sensors.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.240]   Yeah, you can look at it when I brought it.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.200]   When I brought in my iPhone after I dipped it in water, I was smart.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.240]   I said I dipped it in water.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.400]   I did not deny it.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.400]   I did not.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.800]   The guy I said, I dipped it in water and it broke.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.600]   And he looks, he gets his little flashlight, looks in the earphone thing and says, yeah,
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   you dipped it in water.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.200]   I was like, how did you know?
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.760]   I got a patent.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.520]   There's a patent for that.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.280]   Speaking of we'll do one more court case, then we're going to move on.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.280]   We're going to be done with that.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.280]   I know.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   I agree with you, Jason.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.800]   I'll cover this stuff, except you have to because it is a huge problem.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:57.040]   So Oracle sued Google over Java lost.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:03.240]   Now Google says we want $4 million to cover our court costs.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.680]   I hope they get it.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.680]   I don't know.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.920]   I should, you shouldn't pick sides of this because who knows whether it was really right
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.080]   or whatever, right?
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:20.000]   The total bill includes $2.9 million spent copying documents.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.560]   I'm not making this up.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.320]   $2.9 million in Xerox fees.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.760]   That's a lot of intern hours.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.880]   97 million documents were deposed in this case.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.640]   97 million documents.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.520]   I don't know.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.520]   How much was the island?
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.240]   At least $500 million.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.160]   Larry can afford a $4 million to cover Xerox.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.640]   Cover the interns.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.440]   Pay the interns.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   Yes.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.440]   All right.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.440]   We're going to take a break.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440]   Facebook shuts down.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.600]   buysface.com and shuts down the API.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.600]   Thank you.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.160]   Yahoo and Facebook have made it a deal.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:07.680]   They're okay.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.160]   Did you all see the new Twitter search?
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.400]   We'll talk about that.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.400]   What else?
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.040]   I think they might have finally have a CEO of Yahoo.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.040]   Who was it said?
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.040]   No, I don't want it.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.040]   Jason Kiar from Hulu.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.680]   He's like, no thanks.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.920]   Hey, Jason, good news.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.040]   You're on the official list of two people who might be the CEO of Yahoo.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.040]   No.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.040]   No, no, no.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.040]   You don't understand.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.160]   You could be the CEO of Yahoo.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.160]   I don't.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.160]   Let me put it graciously.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.160]   No.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   Okay.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.160]   We'll talk more.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.480]   First, I want to talk a little bit about Ford.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.480]   Ford.com.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.800]   Where is my focus electric?
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.800]   I'm buying one.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.800]   I got to buy one of these.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.680]   If you go to an EV certified Ford dealer, you could take a look.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.520]   It's out the 2012 Ford Focus Electric is out.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.000]   It is the sweetest.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.800]   I've driven them now and I just love it and I really want this car.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:07.060]   And now what I'm really impressed with is Ford saying, look, we want to be a 21st
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:10.060]   century car company, right?
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:14.080]   We want to do things a little differently here.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:19.280]   And so one of the things they've just opened a Silicon Valley office for Ford because one
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:25.500]   of the things they want to do, they consider the car a platform for developers.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:29.500]   So one of the things they're reaching out to developers saying, look, we've got an API.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.520]   This is a car with an API and we want you to develop for it.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.320]   And they've demonstrated this with their MyFord mobile app.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.820]   This is almost like a demonstration of what you can do.
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.740]   And it's for the electric vehicles, the Ford Focus.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.740]   The idea is you put this on your BlackBerry.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.020]   I say BlackBerry because it's in there.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.620]   I don't know if anybody has a BlackBerry.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:54.280]   On your BlackBerry, your iPhone or your Android phone, it has a website, the MyFord mobile
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.280]   website.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.440]   But you can do things like find out.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.440]   It tells you where your car is.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.740]   It tells you what the charge state of the car is.
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:04.620]   You can tell the car, no, only charge the off peak prices.
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:09.300]   And it knows it has an API for the utilities to tell the, I don't know if it's the app
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.820]   or the car, what their off peak hours are.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.300]   And then the car just knows, don't charge until then.
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.020]   You can do things like precondition the cabin temperature.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.340]   You say, I want it to be 72 degrees when I go.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.580]   They call them go times when I'm ready to go.
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.420]   930 in the morning tomorrow.
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:26.420]   And it will do that.
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.740]   And the reason they do that, by the way, is the electric, so you do it while you're plugged
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:29.740]   in.
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:34.220]   It's much more economical to do that.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.860]   Read it or chill it now in days and days like we're having in back east now, this would
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:38.860]   be a nice thing to say.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.580]   I'm going to have the car be 60 degrees when I get it.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.300]   I want it to be a refrigerator.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.060]   I want it to be ice.
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.020]   I want to be shivering when I drive out of the garage.
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.660]   Wouldn't that be of nice?
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:53.180]   Ah, it's freezing.
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:54.180]   That would be nice.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.620]   They could find out where the charging stations are.
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:00.700]   You can, they have this like leaderboards who saved the most CO2 this week.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.700]   I think this is just great.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:09.860]   Ford is really, you know, they're really rethinking how, what a vehicle is, what it means, what
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.660]   your apps mean, and you could find out more.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:16.180]   If you visit the website, Ford.com/technology, or better yet, take your smartphone, bring
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:20.180]   it to your EV certified Ford dealer and say, I want to drive the focus, but I also want
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.420]   the app on my phone because I want to try it out.
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.500]   And they'll do that for you.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.500]   Ford.com/technology.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:31.220]   This car is so green.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:35.900]   Even the seats are made out of grass.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:38.740]   Really?
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.100]   It's made with a fiber.
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.780]   The cloth seat fiber is produced from 100% recycled materials.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.020]   The cushions are a bio based form derived from plant seed oils.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:50.500]   You have to mow it.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.620]   You don't have to mow it.
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.220]   It smells very fresh.
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:55.940]   All their stuff.
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:59.660]   They're really into using, you know, recyclable materials.
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:01.100]   And I know I just love this.
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.100]   In everything they do.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.980]   I tell you something really interesting I learned about Ford.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:09.020]   I actually have a series of, I was there the week before last, and I have a series of
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:13.740]   four part series that I'm doing on there, sort of what they're doing with technology
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:14.740]   that we're doing.
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:18.580]   And one of the really interesting things I learned from a sort of technical hacker kind
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:23.260]   of standpoint in their whole open platform thing is they have this open source, or sorry,
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:29.020]   open platform hardware thing that they do where you can get a piece of equipment from
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:35.740]   bug labs and you can plug it into, you know, the interface in your, in your Ford vehicle.
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:38.220]   And it collects all the data, right?
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.140]   It talked about how sharp you're turning, about how often you're breaking, about all
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.140]   of that stuff.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:47.300]   So you can take that, you can pull all the data from your vehicle, then you can connect
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:52.140]   it to your computer and you can create your own apps and your own, you know, program to
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:55.740]   analyze that data to, you know, do your own stuff.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.060]   I thought that was really cool.
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:01.900]   And my geeky standpoint, that's a really sort of neat thing that they've done to partner
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:05.780]   up with bug labs so that you can, you know, you can do this kind of thing.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.820]   I'm going to have that in one of the articles that I'm writing is going to talk a little
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:09.820]   bit about that.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:14.700]   And then I'm also talking about the fact that they're, they really see themselves wisely,
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:19.620]   I think, not as just a car company, but as a personal mobility company.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:26.620]   So they see themselves as not only about selling you a car, but connecting you to transportation
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:29.180]   and helping you visualize transportation.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:33.580]   And, you know, the fact that, especially in urban area, you know, you may be driving in
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:38.180]   the future and get an alert that, oh, up ahead, there's a, there's a, you know, really bad
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.660]   traffic situation.
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:43.780]   Pull over here, get on the train and, you know, take that the rest of the way to work
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:49.740]   and then take this back, you know, helping you sort of really, you know, be smart about
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.620]   the ways you do this in the future.
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:53.140]   So there's some really cool stuff.
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:57.220]   That's sort of the last article in my series is going to be talking about some of that stuff.
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.260]   Yeah, I talked to him about exactly that.
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.220]   They said, we're, you know, we can't think of ourselves as a car company.
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.940]   You know, it's like the, the trains went out of business because they thought of themselves
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:06.940]   as in the train business.
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.100]   They were in the transportation business and they understood that they could have survived.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.220]   They really realized that there are more than a hundred years old.
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.780]   They really, and I have to say, you know, sometimes you see companies pay lip service
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.700]   to things like eco-friendly.
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:18.700]   This is not lip service.
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:21.460]   I've talked to the very highest levels, you know, at Ford.
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:27.460]   And really not just, you know what the, we went that the, so we went to the Rouge plant,
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.860]   which is Henry Ford's original plant where they made the model tees.
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:32.460]   It's still in, it's still working.
[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:40.980]   And the fact that we went to the Ford F-150 assembly line, the roof is, it's like a, it's
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.500]   like a succulent or something.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:47.300]   The roof is alive and they, and it keeps the place cooler in the summer and warmer in
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.300]   the way.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.820]   And then this, it is not just lip service.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.460]   They're really kind of committed to this whole idea.
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:52.460]   And I think that's great.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:53.460]   I think it's built forward.
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:54.460]   You have to get built forward.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.460]   It is built forward.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:57.460]   He really cares about this stuff.
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:01.100]   It's like, you know, I love seeing founders like Sergei Brin, who really, you know, he,
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:05.580]   they care about this and they want to use their wealth and power, not just to accumulate
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.660]   more wealth and power, but to kind of make the world maybe a little bit better place.
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:10.700]   You got to give Bill Gates credit.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:11.700]   Look what he's doing.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:12.700]   Sure.
[01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.700]   You know?
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.700]   Yep.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:15.700]   Huge credit.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:16.700]   Sergei really likes extreme sports.
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.700]   I know that was some guy diving.
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:18.700]   That was not Google I/O things.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:19.700]   Yeah.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.700]   It's the greatest demo ever, right?
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:26.620]   But you knew, you know that really, I'm sure the original plan was Sergei jumps out of
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:31.420]   a Zeppelin land on the roof, does the bicycle repels fireworks behind him?
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.420]   Yeah.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.420]   You know, the whole thing was going to be Sergei.
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:36.980]   And then the insurance guys got to him and said, I don't think so.
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:37.980]   No.
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:41.860]   Sergei, you can watch at a safe distance.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:42.980]   But you know he wanted to do.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:46.780]   I mean, the whole thing makes more sense if Sergei Brin's doing it, carrying the glasses,
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:47.780]   right?
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.780]   That's the whole reason.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.940]   So look at this one as speaking to Google.
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:52.420]   I don't know how I feel about this.
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:56.780]   British Airways says we're going to Google you before you get on board.
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.420]   Not for security, but just so we can greet you by name.
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:05.900]   We can say how the kids say, hey, how's that business trip going for you?
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:09.700]   It wants to deliver a more personal touch by researching passengers.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.820]   They call it the NoMe program.
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:17.060]   It'll use Google images to find pictures of passengers so that staff can approach them
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:19.060]   as they arrive at the terminal.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.700]   Say hello, Mr. Millian.
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:24.380]   Well, you're looking forward to going home.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:27.260]   We love that column you wrote about.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:29.380]   Is that creepy or is that neat?
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:32.860]   Um, I mean, it's not all that advanced.
[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:36.260]   I Google people before I'm going to a meeting or whatever.
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:40.300]   Before you date a girl, if you'll look her up online and see if she's got any priors.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.300]   Yeah, I do.
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.140]   Stock around four square.
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:48.620]   Joe Boswell, hell head of customer analysis at B.A. says we're essentially trying to recreate
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:53.260]   the feeling of recognition you get in a favorite restaurant when you're welcome there.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:58.500]   But in our case, it will be delivered by thousands of staff to millions of customers.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.900]   This is just the start.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:05.220]   The system has a myriad of possibilities for the future.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.580]   I don't really get the privacy concerns.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:09.740]   It's a little annoying.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.860]   I wouldn't, I wouldn't really want to be harassed by a flight attendant.
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:13.860]   That's how they do it.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.860]   But I like it.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.300]   Maybe it's just me because I have a fragile ego, but I like if they come up.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.980]   Oh, Mr. LePorte.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:20.980]   How are you?
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:21.980]   I loved your show.
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:22.980]   Loved your show.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.340]   Would you like a champagne cocktail?
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:29.220]   Maybe we could bump you up to first class because you have the grass seats and first class.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:30.220]   Do they?
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.860]   I'm probably good.
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:34.700]   I think it's funny.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:39.660]   Our natural reaction to this just because coming out of the of us all growing up in a
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:44.700]   different world than the world that we're sort of in and living in now, right, is to
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:47.060]   be like, "Ooh, that just sounds creepy."
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:52.260]   Like you said, Leo, but I can imagine if somebody like Jeff Jarvis or somebody was on
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.260]   here like, "Oh, get over it."
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:55.740]   Exactly what Jeff was.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.820]   So Nick Pickles, not his real name.
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:58.820]   Maybe it is.
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:19:59.820]   I don't know.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.980]   He's director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.860]   Nick Pickles, that's why he doesn't want him to look up his name.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:10.260]   He says, "Since when is buying a flight ticket, man, giving your airline permission to start
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:13.060]   hunting for information about you on the internet?"
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:16.820]   When you're a reporter and you call up the big, "What is it?
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:17.820]   Watch Dog, girl."
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:18.820]   Big Brother Watch.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:19.820]   You're going to get...
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:20.820]   All right, Nick Pickles here.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:22.820]   Oh yeah, let me give you a quote.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:23.820]   I'll give you a quote.
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:24.820]   Yeah, guys.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.740]   But now, right, Jeff.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:28.740]   Big Brother.
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:29.740]   I mean, it could be nice, right?
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:34.700]   I mean, like you said, I think it's a, "Hey, I mean, people have done this to me.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:38.420]   I could tell when I go into me, like Mark's saying, you know, where I could tell what
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.780]   people have Googled you."
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.180]   And people have said, "Hey, I thought that's really interesting.
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:47.860]   I've even gone into meetings where I'll tell people, like if we're going to dinner or something,
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:52.620]   I'll tell them, like, you know, that I'm vegan so that they don't, you know, so that
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:59.380]   for just to be courteous, so I'm not denying the stuff that are serving me and all of that."
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.700]   And they're like, "Oh, yes, fine.
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:06.420]   You saw it on, you know, we read your, we looked up you up on your site or on LinkedIn or whatever,
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:08.660]   and we noticed that so we already were planning on it."
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:12.260]   And I'm like, "I'm totally freaked out a little, but in the best way."
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:16.860]   It's like, that's, you know, that's really great that they took the time to do that.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:17.860]   And so...
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:20.620]   If I Google you, I'm going to see 10 links that Jason's a vegan.
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.420]   Like how is that showing up in your home?
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.940]   I Googled Nick Hickel's, and I found out now that he's a music photographer, as well as
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:27.820]   director of Big Brother Watch.
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.780]   He likes tea and cakes.
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:30.780]   And he's from Durham.
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:32.860]   Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:36.300]   If I run into Nick Hickel's and I say, "Hey, I love your photography.
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.300]   I saw your stuff."
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:39.260]   It is, you know, it's potentially creepy.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:40.260]   You have to be careful.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.260]   I do this all the time with people.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.260]   You do that to be creepy.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:45.780]   Yeah, but you can't be too creepy like, "Oh, yeah, I've been stalking you."
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:47.100]   But you can say, "Hey, I've seen you.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:48.260]   I know you.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:49.180]   You're a great photographer.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.660]   You could say that."
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:55.020]   I mean, it is public information that we're Googling here.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:59.460]   They say they mostly use it on captains of industry and high profile travelers who'd
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:02.580]   be using first class anyway, so you don't have to worry.
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:03.980]   It's only like big shots.
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.140]   You're captain of industry, Leo.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.740]   I'm a lieutenant colonel of industry.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:13.220]   Yeah, I don't think there's any privacy issue here.
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.220]   I think it's kind of cool.
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:17.260]   I think actually this is good customer service.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.020]   It's not like they're trying to hack your email.
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:23.060]   I mean, they're just looking at the public stuff that you said on Twitter or on your
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:27.660]   personal site or you have out there on LinkedIn or wherever.
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.660]   Right.
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:29.660]   All right.
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:30.660]   We're going to take a break.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:33.660]   I do want to talk about DNS changer because the FBI did something.
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:35.140]   I've talked about this before.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.820]   I don't want to go on and on, but I just think it was reprehensible.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:47.180]   Tomorrow, we will all reap the whirlwind created by the FBI.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:51.260]   You guys, if you don't want to be involved in this, because the I have people, so if
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.740]   I get an IRS audit, it's okay.
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.620]   But if you guys want to step back on this one, you can.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.700]   I'll go after the FBI on this one.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:01.220]   Then we'll talk more about Windows 8 because I want to know what you guys think.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:05.460]   The 32-year-old who talks to himself at the age of 12.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.900]   But first, I had a caller.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.020]   It was so sad.
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:16.780]   Last caller to the radio show today said, "I had a virus, so we brought our stuff in,
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.900]   and the guy fixed it, but we got it back.
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:22.100]   There was nothing of our data on the computer."
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:24.460]   He said, "What's a PST file?"
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.460]   I said, "What?"
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:27.220]   He said, "Well, the guy backed up by PST file."
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:28.220]   I said, "Well, that's good.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.220]   That's your outlook."
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.220]   He said, "But it only goes to 2008."
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:34.820]   He said, "The guy backed up my data, but all he got was one file, my email file from
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   2008."
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.620]   I said, "You didn't have any other backups?"
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:38.620]   He said, "No."
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.460]   I said, "What are you saying?
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:44.460]   Why would you bring in a broken computer if you did not have any backup at all?"
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:48.660]   Anyway, unfortunately, I didn't get to mention carbonite because we ran out of time.
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:49.660]   Let me mention it now.
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:53.780]   If you're not backing up, you need to back up, especially because the time comes, you may
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:58.020]   be able to bring in a computer and they don't give you your data back.
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.020]   Apple says that.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:03.740]   I think any good computer store will say, "Hey, backup before you bring this in."
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:04.740]   Carbonite's great.
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.820]   Even if you're getting a new computer, say, "Let's say you are upgrading Windows 8.
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:07.900]   No problem.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:08.900]   You've been using carbonite.
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:10.860]   You log into your carbonate account on your new computer.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.300]   You say, "Restore my data."
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.060]   It's all there.
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:15.300]   It's so convenient, so easy.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:21.780]   It's automatic, continuous, internet backup, $59 a year for everything on your personal computer.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:23.540]   You're on a single hard drive.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:24.940]   They have multiple hard drive accounts.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:25.940]   They have business accounts.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.460]   In fact, they have a very good small business account.
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:33.340]   Small business account, multiple computers, starts at $229 a year.
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:36.620]   The unlimited of personal online backup, $59 a year per computer.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.900]   That's less than five bucks a month.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:39.900]   You can try it free.
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.460]   One of the reasons I think they do the home trial is great.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.100]   It's two weeks free.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:46.780]   What it does is it gives you a chance to get that first backup set done.
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.780]   Two weeks is enough.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.660]   It depends on your bandwidth, but if you have normal bandwidth, two weeks is usually enough
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:52.100]   to backup all your data.
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:55.460]   Now it's just continuously keeping it up to date whenever you're online.
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.260]   It uses SSL, so you're secure.
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:00.340]   In fact, it supports strong encryption, and they don't have the password.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.940]   Only you do, so you have complete privacy.
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:07.260]   If you want to try this free, just visit carbonite.com.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:10.780]   Where it says offer code down here, just use the word "twit," T-W-I-T.
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:13.300]   You can try it free for two weeks.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:18.060]   You don't need a credit card, just your email and password and the offer code "twit."
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.060]   Risk free.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:23.020]   If you decide to buy, use "twit" again because you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.180]   That is a very good deal.
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:32.340]   Carbonite.com, secure, automatic, online backup, starting at just $59 a month.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.380]   Of course, I put it on every laptop.
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:37.260]   Laptop's the ones you really want this on.
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:39.420]   All right, let's see here.
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:42.580]   Let me show the Jeremiah video because it's cute.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.060]   Jeremiah, what do you know about this, Jettie?
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:45.060]   Is it a filmmaker?
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.060]   Yeah, he's a filmmaker.
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:53.940]   Apparently, he found a video of himself when he was 12, talking to himself 20 years in
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:54.940]   the future.
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.060]   See, now, this makes me kick myself, but we didn't have video when I was 12.
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:59.060]   Right.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.060]   Like, why didn't I do this?
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.060]   I could have drawn a picture of myself.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:03.060]   Right.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:04.660]   So here's, you know, 20 years ago he had a video.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.660]   So here's...
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:09.540]   It says 20 years ago, I left a tape for myself.
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.900]   I think I'd like to talk to myself in the future.
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:13.900]   1992.
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:17.700]   That's something now.
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:20.700]   So I think this is really amazing.
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:29.180]   So fast forward, 32 years, or 20 years to the age of 32.
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.180]   He's got that tape.
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:31.980]   It says, "Don't play until the future."
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:34.140]   Puts it in a VCR.
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:37.260]   Pores himself a drink.
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.900]   Hi, Jeremiah.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.700]   Hello, Jeremiah.
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.340]   You look different.
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:43.340]   No, ****.
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:45.100]   Yes, I'm 12 years old.
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.100]   How old are you?
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.100]   32.
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.100]   Ah.
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.100]   You look older.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.100]   Well, thank you.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.100]   Older than 32, you mean?
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:52.100]   Yes.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.100]   Oh, even better.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.100]   Good.
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.100]   Those just show how much things have changed.
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:56.100]   Yes.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.100]   It does.
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:58.100]   Now I do my hair.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:26:59.100]   No.
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.100]   Right.
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.100]   Right.
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:02.100]   Okay.
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:03.100]   Getting older, man.
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:04.100]   Getting older.
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:05.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.100]   Me?
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:07.100]   Of the future?
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.100]   Oh, is there more of this?
[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:09.100]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:10.100]   So, how are things?
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.100]   No?
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.100]   Okay.
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.100]   This is very unusual.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.500]   Quite cool, you know?
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.700]   Here I am on the screen and here you are.
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:18.700]   You're in there.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:19.700]   Over here, yeah.
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:20.700]   Yes.
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:21.700]   Is there anything in particular you wanted to know about?
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:24.580]   As far as I can see, is Molly still alive?
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:26.620]   Is Molly still alive?
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:27.620]   No.
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:30.580]   Dogs don't live that long.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:31.900]   And why about Leon?
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:34.140]   Are all your questions going to be about pets?
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:35.140]   Yes.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:37.220]   But then the answer is they're all dead.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.220]   Why don't I ask you that?
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.220]   Because you already know.
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:45.620]   Well, yeah, but life before the internet's kind of a blur to me.
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.940]   What, in Croatia?
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:47.940]   The internet.
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.380]   It's a thing that you'll know what it is in a few years.
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:50.780]   It's going to completely take over your life.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:54.020]   You're going to spend many hours sitting in a room staring at a screen.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.420]   I'm knowing about my own future.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:56.420]   That's cool.
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:57.420]   Well, I'm glad that pleases you.
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:58.940]   So, I can't...
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:27:59.940]   What do you do exactly?
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:00.940]   You know what I want?
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:01.940]   You're me.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:02.940]   Yeah, but you must have hobby.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.380]   I'll let you watch the rest of it.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.380]   It's very...
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.380]   You're looking for looking through.
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.380]   You're very good.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.380]   Jeremiah McDonald.
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:10.380]   I don't think this is fake.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:11.380]   I think it's real.
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.540]   It's just, you know, he's a filmmaker.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:16.820]   So maybe he got an actor, but I think that's pretty real.
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:18.780]   They talk about Doctor Who.
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:22.140]   Apparently, he's still a fan after all those years.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.340]   This is very cute.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:27.140]   What do you guys think of the Google Q?
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:28.940]   You all excited about getting one of those?
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:29.940]   I don't understand.
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:31.940]   I don't either.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:32.940]   What?
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:33.940]   Did you go to I/O?
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:34.940]   Did you...
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.500]   I watched I/O and then they...
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.580]   We got the Q and apparently it doesn't work all that well.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:45.740]   It's a great article, I have to say, regarding this by Matt Buchanan on Buzzfeed, in which
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:48.380]   he says, "It never gets better."
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:54.740]   And he says, "Look, we're all used to updates and stuff, and we always, when you buy something
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.620]   new, think, 'Oh, it will get better.'"
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:58.820]   He says, "No, it won't."
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:28:59.820]   If I would tell you...
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:01.660]   To tell you one thing about buying technology, it's this.
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:05.500]   Buy something you like because you like what it is right now.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:09.100]   Not because it's going to get better, or that one day it'll be what you really wanted
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:10.100]   it to be.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:12.580]   He says, "It's like marrying somebody and thinking it'll change them and they'll get
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:13.580]   better.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:14.580]   They might, but they probably won't.
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:19.860]   And over time, you'll hate them even more on yourself, at least a little."
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:24.460]   He says, "The Google Q, it's incredibly tempting to think that since it's got a quad-core
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:28.420]   processor, full-blown Android device inside a marketing campaign that Google will unleash
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:35.340]   a software update that will magically make it worth $300, but it's not."
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:36.740]   I think it's right.
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.060]   It's very well said.
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:39.060]   I say that to...
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.820]   It's funny, I actually say that a lot.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:42.860]   Buy the product you want today.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:48.140]   Not like don't buy it on potential or you think, "This could really turn into something."
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:51.020]   Unless you know, obviously all of us, we buy stuff.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:52.020]   Well, we have to.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:59.620]   I got a piece of glass with the number 737 on it because that's the Google Glasses right
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:03.060]   to buy it for $1,500 next year.
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:04.060]   But I have to.
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:05.060]   It's my job.
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.060]   I do it so you don't have to.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.060]   Exactly.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.140]   It's back there on the set there.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:11.700]   People should totally buy the technology as it is today.
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.740]   This product is such a head scratcher.
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:14.740]   I mean...
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:15.740]   It doesn't even work.
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.380]   Eli, it's back on the know-how set.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:20.100]   It's on the underneath the big TV on the know-how set.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:21.180]   It doesn't even work.
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:25.500]   A lot of people I've seen bought it and they said it stopped working after a week.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.500]   So it's nice.
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.700]   Well, it doesn't do a whole lot to begin with.
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:29.700]   Yeah.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:31.700]   How would you even know?
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.940]   But look, I paid $1,500 for this.
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:38.420]   So that's how crazy I am.
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:39.940]   This will never get better, by the way.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:40.940]   This isn't even upgradable.
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:43.380]   It's just a piece of glass with the number of...
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:44.740]   That will never get better.
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:45.740]   Exactly.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.740]   That cool though?
[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:48.740]   We don't...
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:51.260]   They won't charge us $1,500 until later.
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:52.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:53.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:57.260]   You know, the funny thing is Google is becoming...
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:00.540]   Google's almost like a public research company.
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:05.820]   You know, there's lots of stuff that IBM and Microsoft and a lot of these other big companies
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:08.980]   that they do, and they just never see the light of day.
[01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:11.060]   Google just says, "Go ahead, try it."
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:13.180]   They did say you can hack it.
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:14.180]   Yeah.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:17.540]   I mean, they take stuff and create it and it has like...
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:20.980]   You have no idea what you want to use with it or what the...
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:22.460]   It's like Google Buzz, right?
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:23.460]   Google Buzz.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:28.420]   People were crazy about that and I was just sitting there like, "Why would anybody want
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:29.420]   to do this for a minute ever?
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.420]   Well, you were right.
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:32.340]   It looks neat, but what would I ever want to do with it?
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.460]   Who would I ever do this with and for what reason?"
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:37.860]   So they have all these things that they just keep pumping them out, right?
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:38.860]   And throwing them out there.
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:44.620]   Let's see if people like this stuff, even if we have no idea who the target market is
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:48.180]   and what they would want to do with this product and that kind of thing.
[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:49.820]   It's so opposite.
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.900]   It makes them so unique in a way, right?
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:57.340]   Because it's so opposite the traditional way that you run a company and that you do your
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:00.580]   research department and you do all of this.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:05.660]   So in one sense, I sort of tip my hat to them because they're totally breaking the
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:07.940]   mold in the way that they're doing this stuff.
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:12.940]   And in the other, it's just kind of laughable to see all of the products that they put out
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:13.940]   to market.
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:17.700]   And I do worry at some level if it's going to hurt their brand.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:24.500]   If they put out 20 products and 19 of them are absolute, you know, Lee horrible.
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:27.500]   And every once in a while, they have one that's done.
[01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.100]   Look at Google Wave.
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:30.100]   Yes.
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.460]   There was a product that they got a lot of fun.
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:35.740]   But this is hardware and you look at it and you go, "Well, they wouldn't have released
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:40.580]   this if it didn't have some use for $300."
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:44.820]   I mean, it's also the opposite of how Larry Page, when he started said he wanted to run
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:45.820]   the company.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:49.780]   I mean, the other story on our list is how they just shut down a bunch of products.
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:54.340]   Because they wanted to zero in and focus on something in particular.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:57.980]   So I don't understand this at all.
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:32:58.980]   It's just weird.
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:03.540]   You know, I have to say, even at the, we're watching the keynote and they said the price
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.180]   and it was like, "Well, that's dead on arrival.
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.100]   I don't understand what that is at all."
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:13.140]   I mean, Google TV is this with more features and less expensive.
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.140]   Right.
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:15.140]   I like Google TV.
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.140]   I have a Google TV.
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.140]   I used it last night.
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.140]   I don't like Google TV.
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.700]   It's this plus more for less.
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:21.700]   For less, right.
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:22.700]   You're right.
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:23.700]   It's still crap.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:28.340]   But I love that you see this great picture of the European Parliament.
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:31.180]   Oh, is it here?
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:33.500]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:39.460]   So ACTA was voted upon by the EU Parliament and they voted it down and look at these pictures.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.740]   Hello, democracy.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.260]   Goodbye ACTA.
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.260]   Gone.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:44.260]   Hallelujah.
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:46.260]   These are Parliament members.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.060]   These are the people who voted on it.
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.940]   Building up these signs.
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:57.140]   Finally, ACTA was the treaty that was basically created by the US content industry motion picture
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:34:04.140]   television music to basically turn off the internet.
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:05.980]   If you're a pirate, three strikes, that's it.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.740]   No more in an effort for you for the rest of your life.
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:11.940]   It kind of restores your faith in humanity.
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:14.500]   It's like you can fool some of the people some of the time, right?
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.300]   But you can't fool all the people all the time.
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.300]   Kind of made me sad.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:21.900]   You can't imagine the US Congress having members of Congress holding up signs saying hello,
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:23.820]   democracy, goodbye ACTA.
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:25.780]   I don't even think they know what ACTA is.
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:28.540]   Congress is a circus all its own.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:31.300]   And I don't know if the EU Parliament is not a circus.
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:34.580]   But that's, yeah, I mean, that's cool.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:36.620]   They at least knew what they were voting on.
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.860]   Maybe these are the five members of the pirate party.
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:42.940]   I was saying that's a very small snippet.
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:49.340]   I think their democracy is just as messy and silly as ours sometimes.
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:50.340]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:55.300]   Of course, we didn't get to vote on the Congress didn't get to vote on ACTA in the US.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:59.100]   Because it's a treaty, the president just did it.
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:00.100]   Let's see.
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:03.340]   I had another couple of things I wanted to mention.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:04.460]   Oh, this is good.
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:05.460]   Def leopard.
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.500]   Remember them?
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:08.500]   Kids?
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:14.580]   So they don't own the rights to their music, right?
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:15.820]   The record industry does.
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:18.500]   So when so they don't get any of the money from the digital downloads.
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:19.500]   So what are they doing?
[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:22.020]   They're rerecording their songs.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:25.020]   So they get the rights.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:29.220]   Def leopard, most famous for the 1987 hit, "Porse Some Sugar On Me."
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:31.100]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.100]   Are going...
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.100]   Can they do that?
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:34.100]   I mean, they can do that.
[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:35.700]   They can rerecord them.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.700]   And then the performances.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.500]   But don't they have not had the right to vote?
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.500]   Get this.
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:41.500]   This is the loophole.
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.900]   So they've been negotiating with universal music which owns their rights.
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:47.900]   They cannot get a suitable royalty for digital downloads.
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:53.500]   So instead, they're taking advantage of a law which protects cover versions from copyright
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.340]   claims.
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:36:01.020]   You can make a cover version of a song and you're not violating copyright, right?
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:06.740]   So they're covering their own songs and releasing them in iTunes.
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:09.860]   They describe them as forgeries.
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:14.780]   Our contract is such that they can't do anything with our music without our permission, not
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:15.780]   a thing.
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.820]   So we send them a letter saying no matter what you want, you are going to get no as an answer
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:21.980]   so don't ask.
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:26.740]   And we're going to make cover versions of our own songs.
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:27.740]   How old are they now?
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.700]   Ah, they must be 80 but that's good.
[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:30.700]   Yeah.
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:33.700]   "Porshosh on sugar on me."
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.460]   That's a problem.
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:36.460]   You're right.
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:39.500]   That sounds exactly the same.
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.220]   I love that.
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:45.740]   So Microsoft has announced that no matter what version of Windows you've ever used, $40 to
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:47.180]   upgrade to Windows 8.
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.620]   Is that low enough?
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:52.180]   Yeah, that's a pretty good price.
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:58.020]   But I mean, is it low enough for somebody to actually upgrade to Windows 8?
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.780]   The upgrade thing is sort of a...
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:05.180]   Well, before you say that, the upgrade on Windows 8, according to Paul Thorett, our Windows
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:08.700]   weekly guy, is normally what you want to do is clean install.
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:10.260]   He said no, it's really good on Windows 8.
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:11.940]   It's essentially a clean install.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:14.420]   So an upgrade is not a bad thing to do.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:18.300]   Windows 8 Pro is basically going to cost $40.
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:23.820]   Even if you still only have XP, you'll be able to download it from windows.com.
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:27.220]   You can add Windows Media Center from the add features option for free.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:29.860]   Of course, if you get a new computer it comes with it.
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:34.360]   But if you buy a computer between now and the release of Windows 8, $15, if you want
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:40.220]   packaging $70, they have never had such a low price for Windows ever, $40.
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:41.980]   Not in this country.
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:47.820]   Is this Microsoft saying we don't think 8's going to sell, so we better make it cheap?
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:50.780]   Or is it them saying we've got to get everybody to go to 8?
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:52.980]   We're committed to this.
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:54.420]   It's a little bit of that.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:38:00.460]   Certainly a little bit of it is them knowing that this is a big gamble for them, right?
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:02.460]   Windows 8 is a huge gamble.
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:06.960]   Maybe the biggest gamble that Windows has made since they were trying to get everybody over
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.560]   to Windows 2000, right?
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:15.280]   That kind of bombed and XP, so they sort of did XP and XP caught on.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.400]   So this is a big bet for them.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.800]   So I plot- It's a gamble in the sense that a lot of their revenue comes from Windows,
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:22.800]   right?
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:23.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:24.800]   Exactly.
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.160]   And I mean, that's not going to change.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.640]   It's just going to, you know, on new computers is where they're going to- Right.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.380]   So Windows 8 is going to happen.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:35.700]   So few people really do the upgrade, do upgrades.
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:38.940]   Consumers do upgrades in very, very small numbers.
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:40.700]   They just get a new machine.
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:46.060]   You know, now the enterprise does upgrades, obviously, and they make lots and lots of
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:48.580]   money on those.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:54.260]   But you know, I think that they are realizing that they have to create some buzz around
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:59.340]   Windows 8, and they are wisely doing everything they can to do that.
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:02.440]   And this is one of those things that is helping them.
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:07.000]   They look like a company that really cares about consumers and is trying to get stuff
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.100]   out there at a real aggressive price for the people that do want to do upgrades, which
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:18.760]   is a lot of the technophile audience, which a lot of those folks are kind of ambivalent
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.800]   about Windows right now.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:26.760]   There's a lot that are still big on it, but they will do some upgrades.
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.480]   And at $40, they'll be happy about it.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:31.980]   And I do think, if I remember this right, it's kind of time-bombed, right?
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:37.620]   They're saying you can do it with what, by the end of within the first four months or
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:40.260]   by the end of January 2013 or something.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:44.900]   So they're basically saying that the price will go back up to what, $69.99 or something.
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:45.980]   It's still going to be cheap.
[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:49.500]   And I, you know, I'm wondering, I mean, you think that they reserve the right to do that,
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:53.900]   but I think, you know, they may not, they may say that, right?
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:56.100]   And then when they get to January, they're like, oh, that's all right.
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.100]   We're going to make it $30.
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:59.520]   We're going to do it indefinitely.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:04.040]   I mean, they could have seen, you know, Apple keeps lowering the price of their upgrades
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:05.800]   and delivering them digitally.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:10.600]   And I, at one of the last press conferences, Apple paraded out this percentage of people
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.200]   who had upgraded over what time period.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.040]   A lot of Apple users upgrade compared to Windows.
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.040]   It's insane.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.040]   It's unprecedented.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.040]   So it's entirely possible that Microsoft saw this trend.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.040]   They want this model.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:26.160]   Especially, you know, going back to your point that they want as many people on this because
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.500]   the app infrastructure is completely different.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:32.480]   If they get, you know, millions of people using this right away, then developers will
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.080]   be compelled to develop for it.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.680]   They'll get those apps that will also work on the tablet.
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.880]   This makes a lot of sense.
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:40.880]   That's exciting.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.920]   Smart move, smart move.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.680]   How do you guys feel about eight?
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:45.680]   You excited?
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.920]   I mean, I presume both of you has used the consumer preview by now.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:48.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:49.920]   A little bit.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:51.920]   It's dangerous.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.640]   It's very risky.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:55.640]   Very, very risky.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:41:01.560]   They're betting on one thing really, ultimately, and that's sort of the convergence.
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:05.920]   They're going to bet that you don't want to buy a tablet and a laptop and that you're
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.600]   going to want to do it.
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.840]   You're going to want to use their device.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:11.840]   And so they're betting on convergence.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:16.640]   And the thing is, is they're making a lot of compromises both ways because that, even
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.240]   more so on the sort of traditional desktop side.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.280]   But they are still, or make some compromises on the tablet side, right?
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:32.640]   Of certain things, certain even settings and apps, you have to go into the desktop version
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.800]   or the full desktop in order to run them.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:39.800]   Like, this is the biggest mistake I think they're making is not doing just a metralized
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:42.280]   app of office.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:47.840]   Making you, when you go to office, you have to go into that sort of desktop environment
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.840]   to run it.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:51.360]   And on a tablet, that's not going to be a good experience.
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:58.400]   Even on the iPad, I think Apple went way too much on pages and all those, their apps,
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.640]   they're too desktop-like.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:00.640]   I don't want them.
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:03.920]   I end up using simpler word processors and stuff because it's too much.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:08.400]   And so I think Microsoft's making the mistake almost even worse.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.440]   And I think that could hurt them from the tablet side.
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:18.080]   And then on the desktop side, having to navigate Metro to do your desktop stuff is really annoying.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.960]   And they're betting that you're going to have this converged device.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:25.440]   And during the daytime, when you're working, you're going to use that sort of just standard
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.440]   Windows environment.
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:29.720]   And then at the nighttime, you're going to sort of flip it back or just use the screens
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.360]   going to pop out or whatever.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.440]   And you're going to use Metro and you know, it'll have all your data and everything and
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.320]   your apps on the same device.
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:38.920]   That's what they're betting on.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:44.320]   And whether consumers accept that or not is going to have a lot to say about not only
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:47.640]   the future of Windows, but the future of Microsoft.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.600]   And from Chicago, I had an interesting point in our chatroom.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:53.760]   He said, maybe what Microsoft's doing is offering is moving completely to the Apple
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:43:00.080]   model where they'll do yearly upgrades at 30 or 40 bucks.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.880]   And then, Jason, that kind of makes sense with what you're saying.
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:03.880]   I mean, I agree with you.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:04.880]   Microsoft needs to be.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:07.200]   And I've kind of thought that they were all in on this.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:10.120]   They can't say, well, we're going to hedge our bets and have a little bit of desktop
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:11.320]   and a little bit of Metro.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.680]   They need to really commit.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:15.920]   Maybe if they're planning yearly upgrades, they're going to say one year and then the
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.920]   desktop's going to be gone.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.360]   You know, I agree with you.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.440]   I think that it's risky.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:24.160]   But if you're going to do it, you have to go 100%.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.400]   You can't hedge your bets.
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.360]   You have to say, we're committed.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.680]   I don't think Metro is all that great on a computer.
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:31.680]   I don't think so either.
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.160]   But they're making that move.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.320]   I think they should still do two products.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.760]   And this is what they don't want to do.
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.360]   And this is what I really think they should do is I think they could still make a great
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:44.120]   Metro, just a tablet that runs Metro.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:45.600]   I think that's a great idea.
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:48.000]   And they're going to Windows RT.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000]   That's it.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.080]   There's that one exception, which is office.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.320]   That's the only exception.
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.920]   And they'll have a fix for that.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.920]   I agree.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.820]   But even a lot of the stuff that you do to configure stuff and maybe they'll fix this
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:02.680]   in the final version, but probably not, right?
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:06.320]   A lot of you go to configure things, configure, you know, a lot of the settings and stuff.
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:09.280]   And it like takes you into the desktop environment on a tablet.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:13.040]   And it's just like, oh, it's not a good experience.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:14.880]   And I think people are going to be confused.
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:20.200]   I mean, trying to do your finger and like tap the little window to close something, just
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:25.840]   simple things like that that are annoying are going to really turn off a lot of consumers.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:31.560]   I think if they should just focus on a Metro tablet and then they should still try to make
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:34.120]   their desktop OS solid.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:37.560]   And you know, there's still plenty of market for them to do that.
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:40.080]   But obviously this is the bet they're making.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.480]   And this is, you know, Windows is going to live or die on how, whether they're right
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:46.480]   in making this bet.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.800]   You're willing to make a bet on what are they right?
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:52.720]   What's the reaction going to be in a couple of months when it comes out?
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:57.760]   I think it's going to be pretty brutal for people that buy this, to buy those tablets
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:02.760]   and then they go to try to configure something and they've got to tap that little X to close
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.760]   a window.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:05.240]   I can hear the howls already.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.240]   Yep.
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:07.240]   Right.
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:11.480]   And when you can, Windows 8 on the desktop, it's bizarre.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:12.480]   Yes.
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:13.480]   Yes.
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:17.560]   They're going to, they're trying to make everybody happy and they're going to tick off
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:21.320]   their power users on the desktop because you're trying to use Metro on that.
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:24.520]   And then the people that want to, there's a lot of people that want to give Windows
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.960]   tablets a shot and I think they will.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:32.720]   But I think this sort of halfway in between factor could hurt them to the people that
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:38.960]   are ready to give them on, you know, a chance to buy a surface instead of an iPad.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:40.200]   What do you think?
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.840]   The Windows curse is not in their favor.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.160]   Xt every other one.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:47.160]   This is the Windows ME/XP Vista.
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.160]   Oh, true.
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.160]   Vista.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.160]   Every other one.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.000]   Well, I don't know if I believe in that, but I do think that they are, I admire them
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000]   for taking a huge chance.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000]   I do too.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.800]   I bet the company on this and I think that they, the closer we get, the warmer I'm
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.320]   worried, to be honest.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.760]   The surface looks really cool.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:09.240]   I just, I don't like Metro all that much on the computers.
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:11.280]   Last story, NBC and Google, I didn't know this.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:13.760]   Of course, NBC is broadcasting the Olympics.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:17.160]   I didn't know that Google will be doing the streaming.
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.040]   Makes sense, right?
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:27.360]   They're wargaming it because they expect disruptions, DDoS attacks, terrorism.
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.120]   So they are really, there's a good article in the CIO Journal of the Wall Street Journal
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:40.400]   on how they're preparing their staging war games to prepare for Olympic disruptions.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:41.400]   I'm excited.
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:42.400]   I can't wait.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.160]   This will be the most internet at Olympics ever, right?
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.880]   This is going to be it, right?
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:49.040]   How many, I would guess this will be the first time more people will watch online than
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:51.360]   watch on the television.
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:54.080]   Partly because of the time difference in the US.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:58.160]   That would be interesting to watch.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:01.080]   You really think that's possible this year?
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:05.400]   Of course, that's the fear.
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:08.160]   NBC's got to worry that they're going to get that kind of cannibalized.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.720]   They pay a lot of money.
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:16.200]   Yeah, they pay a lot of money and they're doing more, more hours in the day of programming
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:19.560]   on Olympics than anyone else has in the past.
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:23.120]   I mean, they're going to be just wall to wall coverage of this.
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:28.840]   In this article, they're saying that the streaming, the online content actually created pre-air
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:34.440]   buzz and encourage more people to watch the taped broadcast on television later.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.520]   Interesting.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:41.280]   I think the cool thing about what they're doing this year is they're going back to the
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.440]   model of like it was, I don't know.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:46.440]   You guys are probably old enough to have watched like the 84 Olympics when they were
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.160]   at the US.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.600]   I mean, they showed like every sport and every, you know, you got to see-
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.600]   I loved those days.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:54.160]   You know, I love that.
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.920]   You got to see like all the semi-finals and the, you know, early heats of races and swims
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:00.920]   and stuff like that.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:01.920]   It was so awesome.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:06.680]   And in the last few years, they've gone to this really feature model where they do like
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.960]   in 50 minutes of story and then you get your 10 minutes of-
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:10.960]   Right.
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.720]   Yeah, well, the events and that's what the internet's going to give them.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:21.920]   They are doing 3500 hours of online events on YouTube and Rick Cordella or Cordella, the
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.480]   senior vice president for digital media and NBC says, if there's a camera on it, we will
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:27.480]   stream it.
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:32.560]   They are effectively saying we will stream everything that we've got cameras for.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:33.560]   That's awesome.
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:36.040]   And you knew that that future was coming at some point, right?
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.280]   Because you know that there are, they're recording everything.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.680]   They know it for years.
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:40.680]   They know it.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.080]   NBC is hoping to be online viewership.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:53.200]   The Beijing Olympics drew 52 million uniques, 75 and a half million video streams.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.160]   Oh, I think they'll beat it hand lay this time.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:56.560]   Oh, they'll kill that.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:57.560]   That's very interesting.
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:58.600]   I mean, that's four years ago.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:00.040]   That's one of the things that's great about the Olympics.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:04.800]   It really is because it's four years, you can really see the world change.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:05.800]   Totally.
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:08.120]   Olympics and elections are both the presidential elections.
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:12.640]   You really see how campaign strategy, everything changes because it's four years and the internet
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:13.640]   goes a long way.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:14.640]   Obama's on Pinterest.
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:19.640]   Yeah, I don't get that.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:22.880]   They're thinking for the next four years, we're going to have blue in the Oval Office.
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:23.880]   I don't know.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:26.800]   So it's looking to decorate.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:27.800]   Yeah, sure.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:31.240]   Hey, guys, I think we're done for the day.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:33.280]   I want to thank you, Jason Heiner, for being here.
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.560]   Jason, oh, do we have the week ahead?
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.560]   We do have that.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.560]   All right.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:41.400]   Well, let me first, before we say goodbye to you guys, Tom Merritt has a look at what's
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:42.400]   coming up this week.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.960]   What are they going to be the big stories, Tom?
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:44.960]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.520]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on on Tech News today and
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:48.520]   the week ahead.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.400]   Of course, starting today, Sunday, July 8, the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.400]   kicks off.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:54.400]   That'll be running all week.
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:57.880]   We'll see how many tiers are coming out of developers over the Microsoft Surface tablet.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:01.480]   Monday, July 9, the DNS changers servers go off.
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:02.480]   I forgot to mention that.
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:05.880]   Check and make sure you don't have that malware or you're going to lose your internet connection.
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:10.080]   Tuesday, July 10, the Samsung Galaxy S3 set to hit Verizon.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:14.960]   Big bang theory seasons one and two come to Blu-ray and Mobile Beat Games beat conference
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.480]   kicks off in San Francisco.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:21.240]   Thursday, July 12, there's a rumor that the US ISPs will start pestering people accused
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:26.680]   of copyright infringement as part of that multi-step graduated enforcement regime.
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.800]   That more coming up on Tech News today and the week ahead.
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:29.800]   Back to you.
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:32.880]   I forgot to mention that Monday's DNS changer day.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.960]   And apparently, Tom is a big bang theory fan?
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:36.280]   Yes, of course he is.
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:37.560]   In fact, I'm waiting.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:40.920]   I don't understand the Higgs boson discovery, but I know that Sheldon will explain all
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:43.400]   in big bang theory and I'm waiting for that.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:44.600]   That's when I will understand.
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:47.680]   I was reading a great article actually on the Atlantic.
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:50.000]   I was at the Atlantic somewhere.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000]   A scientist from Yale University said this is the most important discovery of the century
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000]   the Higgs boson.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.200]   The fact that they've confirmed the standard model is huge.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.200]   Don't understand.
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:06.200]   So DNS changer, if nobody who watches this show could possibly be affected by this,
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:09.200]   you can go to I should mention public service.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:12.760]   Go to DNS dash, okay dot us.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:16.120]   Could they have gotten a worse name for this?
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:20.280]   DNS dash, okay dot us.
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:24.460]   And if you have DNS changer on your system, unless you're in a net service provider is
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:29.360]   actively protecting you, you will get a green if you don't have it and you'll get a red.
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.680]   Now, if you do have it, I love this.
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:32.680]   The FBI.
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:33.880]   So they put this together.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:35.680]   Here's a link.
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:38.840]   If you're, if you're, if you're additional information regarding DNS changer malware,
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:40.200]   visit the FBI's website.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.200]   So let's click that link.
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:42.200]   What do we get?
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:48.880]   We get a press release from the FBI on how great they were when they arrested these guys
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:49.880]   in November.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:52.880]   And here's a nice picture of the assistant director in charge of the New York office.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:57.680]   Today with a flip of a switch, the FBI and our partners dismantled the rogue criminal
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:58.680]   letter.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:03.440]   This should have information about disinfecting your system.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:12.920]   This has a press release for the FBI on it.
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:15.600]   First of all, the FBI should never have left.
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:19.000]   So what happened is they, I should, you all know this in November.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.520]   This thing, this malware had been going on.
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:23.400]   There was a, it was a gang in Estonia that had been doing it.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:27.760]   They enter Paul and the FBI arrested these guys through them in jail, but instead of
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:31.720]   turning off the server, the DNS, so what happens with DNS changer is it changes your
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:36.600]   DNS settings so that instead of you using your normal DNS or your ISP's DNS, you use
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:41.000]   their server and that gives them a chance to misdirect you to affiliate sites, make
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.400]   a little money on the site, put some different ads, whatever, but you got malware on your
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:45.400]   system.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:51.080]   So the FBI arrested them instead of taking their malware server offline as would normally
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:55.360]   be done, they said, no, you know, we should keep this running for a while.
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.960]   So they kept it running and they're going to turn it off on Monday.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:05.400]   So for six months, 300,000 people apparently have been running malware and not known it.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:09.760]   So tomorrow you're going to your server, your website, you won't be able to get on
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:10.760]   the internet.
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.800]   So that's a sign you've been running malware.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:13.800]   What does the FBI do?
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:18.400]   They redirect you to a press release just in case you didn't know who did this fine thing
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.080]   to you.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:22.080]   What is the story?
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:26.360]   You guys can, I know you don't want to get an IRS audit, but I don't care.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.880]   This is, this is not how the government should be operating.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:31.120]   They should have shut the servers down or better yet.
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:34.920]   They should have kept the server up and put a big sign when you use your computer.
[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:35.920]   You're infected.
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.920]   Go get fixed.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:41.080]   You knit with instead it silently continues to operate so that the malware can continue
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:45.080]   to run, do whatever else it wants to do to your system for six months and then we'll
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:47.960]   break it.
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:48.960]   Is it just me?
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:49.960]   Yeah.
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:52.560]   No, six months is a long time to leave the same.
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:53.880]   They could have the day one.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:55.880]   They could have put a sign up that said, yeah.
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:56.880]   You got a malware.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:57.880]   Go fix it.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:58.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:00.200]   Your internet's not working for a reason.
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:03.560]   You've got a virus.
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.960]   I agree.
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.600]   Not handled well, not handled well.
[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:09.480]   Should have been handled much, much better.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:16.840]   The Canadian DNS dash, okay.ca apparently has a fix on it.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:18.680]   So you just don't use the US one.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:25.400]   Let me just try it because apparently they, they don't, yeah, see, this is better.
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:27.640]   It's in French and English.
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.760]   This is from Sira, the Canadian registered.
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:30.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.760]   I got to sign up for terms and agreements.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:36.120]   Put the malware check to get the malware check.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.120]   To get the malware check.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:38.840]   So it's no better.
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:39.840]   How does it check her work?
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.680]   Your computer system does not seem to be affected.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:42.680]   Okay.
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:48.680]   They do have a link to a public safety candidate document that tells you more about this.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:50.280]   That looks like a press release to me.
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:51.280]   You're right.
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:53.240]   Here's the FBI announcement.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:56.320]   Here's the website about the malware suggested.
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:57.320]   Finally, here we go.
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:04.640]   Go to the start menu, select run, run cmd.exe, type in the black command window, ipconfig/all.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:07.000]   Search for the line written DNS servers.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.400]   Often two or three IP addresses are identified.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:10.400]   Verve.
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.960]   Oh my God.
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:12.960]   Really?
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:16.200]   Do they have a version of that press release in French?
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:18.760]   No, they do.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:19.760]   No.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:23.640]   If you're on a Mac, you don't have to worry.
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:24.640]   Incorrect.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.200]   Oh, that's right.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.800]   It's only Windows.
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:31.320]   All right.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.320]   That's enough.
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:36.720]   Jason Heiner, tech republic, it is because of you that I am considered by many, the president
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:37.720]   of the internet.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.720]   For this, I thank you every time I fly British Airways, they say, Mr. President, welcome.
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:43.720]   Exactly.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.080]   Thank you.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:46.640]   Thank you.
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:51.200]   You can follow him at techrepublic.com but also on zdnet and cnet and everywhere.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:52.880]   He's working everywhere.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.880]   Yes, sir.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.880]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:55.880]   Good to have you.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:56.880]   Really appreciate it.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:57.880]   Would you ever come out this way or you just stay in the loop?
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:58.880]   I do.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:55:59.880]   I do actually pretty regularly.
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:02.080]   I haven't been to the new studio next time I come.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.080]   I'd love to come up as a new studio.
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:05.080]   Come up.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:06.480]   Come up.
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:08.640]   From Bloomberg Business Week, Mr. Mark Millian.
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:10.600]   Great to have you too, Mark.
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:11.600]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:12.600]   How's the new job?
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.600]   You like it?
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:14.600]   Loving it.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:16.600]   You do great work.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:20.240]   Every respect they attribute, they give you email addresses for everybody who writes
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.760]   the article so you can respond.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.640]   Oh, I get some crazy stuff.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:25.320]   I bet you do.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.880]   But this is a good journalist again at present.
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:31.160]   I use them whenever I can, frankly, for these stories.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:33.040]   You guys do a really, really good job.
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:34.840]   Great investigative stuff.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:39.760]   One of the last places that's funding really great investigative stuff.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:40.760]   Exactly.
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:41.760]   Exactly.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:44.240]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.240]   A couple of notes.
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:47.800]   First of all, TNT is now on a 10 AM Pacific.
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.520]   That's 1 PM Eastern time, 1700 UTC, Monday through Friday.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:53.880]   That's where you get your daily news fixed.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:58.080]   We moved it to an earlier time so that you can get it for your afternoon commute.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:00.560]   And that seems to be working out pretty well.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:06.120]   We do this show still at 3 PM Sundays as we have for, gosh, since 2005.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:08.320]   Seven years now.
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:16.120]   Three PM Pacific, six PM Eastern time, 2,200 UTC on Twitch.tv.
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:17.640]   We're so glad you could join us.
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:19.480]   Please come back again.
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:22.320]   And of course, remember all the great shows all week long on Twitch.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:23.320]   You know what?
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:24.320]   Just leave it on.
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:25.320]   You never know.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:28.640]   There's always something good going on.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:29.640]   And you're right, Jeff.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.560]   He says it was actually moved because Tom was sick of me running late.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.560]   That's actually the real reason.
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:35.560]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:36.560]   We'll see you next time.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:37.560]   Another tweet.
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:38.560]   Thank you.

[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:45.560]   I'm just going to the golf club.
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:46.560]   The golf club.
