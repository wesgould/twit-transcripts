[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.400]   Ian Thompson will talk about the transfer of the Twitter accounts,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.560]   the final days of the Tech surge, and a friend of ours,
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.400]   who now has a pretty big job keeping the government techy.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.080]   Plus, what's going on with Apple and Qualcomm?
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.800]   It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.440]   the week's tech news.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.600]   Hey, it's nice once in a while we get
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.320]   one of our own hosts sitting at the table.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.000]   Father Robert Ballisaire has dained to join us.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.720]   Good to see you.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.440]   It's great to be back.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.880]   Post of Nor How and this week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.380]   Yeah.
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.120]   It's my job to make sure we have lots of stuff floating
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.440]   around the studio that could kill you.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.480]   I notice you're still growing things.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.400]   Yes.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.760]   Growing is a very loose term.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.000]   I've put them into automated devices.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.120]   And I'm kind of wondering how long it will take for them to die.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.800]   Oh, nice.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.160]   So they get watered and light and everything.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.040]   They get watered and light, but they're being very much
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.840]   abused at the moment.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.120]   There was a whole segment of KnowHow
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.480]   that was called GrowHow.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.320]   And he was showing us how to grow herbs.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.920]   Like herbs.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.400]   Like herbs.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.000]   Like green things.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.880]   Hey, that's Jason Kalen.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.400]   Can this great to see you again, my friend?
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.200]   Good to be here.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.280]   Good to be here.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.120]   Inside.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.600]   Inside.com is my first startup.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.680]   And of course--
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.800]   14 newsletters and growing.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.720]   The newsletters are great.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.360]   Now, do you still do in the SMS newsletter?
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.560]   Did that work out or no?
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.840]   It's just an experiment I call it.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.240]   Jason's TxTList.com.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.000]   And 1,300 people are on it.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.200]   And what I said was I have 100,000 emails over here.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.880]   Let me see if any of them want to just get
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040]   very personal thoughts over SMS.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.160]   The interesting thing is, very few people unsubscribe.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.360]   I have to do something really interesting if I send it.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.040]   How many a day do you end up sending?
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.560]   I send maybe two or three a week.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.760]   OK.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.160]   So it's a very personal thing that I
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.680]   don't want to deal with shenanigans on Twitter about.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.920]   So I privatize my Twitter.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.640]   But it is Twitter-like, isn't it?
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.200]   It's short, but it's 1% of your audience, 100% open rate.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.560]   And it's the most intimate communication.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.000]   Give me an example.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.120]   Well, today I was talking about one.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.840]   I just let people know that I finished--
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.960]   I was listening to Shoe Dog, and I loved it,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.600]   and what other books are you interested in.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.640]   And another one was, I was just saying,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.280]   I'm thinking about buying these modular homes
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.360]   and putting it on a lot somewhere.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.520]   And I was wondering if anybody had done a development project.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.080]   So it is very much like Twitter.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.880]   It is, but it's stuff that I don't necessarily
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.640]   want in the public that the press would pick up on,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.960]   or that would be a permanent record.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.560]   Interesting.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   One to few.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.640]   But every time you're here, we have great conversations.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.600]   You just told me about John Mayer performing with The Dead
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.080]   and how great that was.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.680]   And I watched a video.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.320]   So I learn every time you're here.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.120]   I get some of that value.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.600]   It's nice.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.000]   I can see why people subscribe to that.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.680]   Also, here for the register.co.uk, a good friend here,
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.280]   and Ian--
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.640]   Sir Ian Thompson.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   Not quite.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.960]   Somehow, I doubt how much is going to be
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.320]   not too many Tom Soons.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.880]   I loved Sir Ian McKellen marched in London March yesterday.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.320]   And his poster.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.680]   And people thought it was shopped.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.520]   But there were enough images of it
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.520]   that I think it was real was of his good friend, John Luke
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.080]   Picard, with his famous face palm.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.280]   Face palm.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.880]   And that's all.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.200]   No words.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.440]   So he was trolling him.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.360]   It was wonderful.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.240]   I thought it was really--
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.560]   I saw them in a play together.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.640]   There it is.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.240]   Yeah, they're good friends, of course.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.760]   No, they're very good friends.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.600]   And they--
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.240]   They're palarano.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.560]   He's a lot of interesting work on that.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.720]   And I'm sure he was inwardly quite pleased to be carrying
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   it out.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.640]   So there was-- obviously, we don't have to talk around it.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.800]   On Friday, the really important peaceful transition
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.320]   of Twitter accounts.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.520]   And it didn't go completely smoothly.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.040]   Not so much now.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.760]   But so just to recap, @POTUS, president of the United States,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.680]   was created-- wasn't it last year?
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.560]   Of course, President Obama, at president of the time,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.800]   was using it.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.360]   And always the intent was.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.360]   They even said this at the beginning.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.720]   This is not Obama's account.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.640]   This is the office's account.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.760]   And so the Secret Service said, now, Mr. President,
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.640]   would you please start using POTUS?
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.280]   They took Obama's tweets and moved them to the POTUS 44.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.560]   Probably archived it.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.120]   Yeah, he can't tweet anymore to it.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.440]   It's done.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.480]   And he can't edit it.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.440]   It's done.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.040]   As it should be.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.680]   And I think this is the case of almost everything that
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.520]   goes on in the White House.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.320]   It becomes a matter of public record at some point.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.200]   And but what's interesting is the Secret Service
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.480]   took away Trump's galaxy phone.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.400]   We don't know exactly what kind of galaxy.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.360]   As they did with Obama, and they gave him
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.440]   some sort of secure phone.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.400]   We don't know what it is.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.680]   Now, did they really take it away from him
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.840]   or just say, put it in your draw?
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.880]   Well, with Obama, I think he was really forbidden.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.760]   And this is the interesting question.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.880]   I mean, you're the president of the United States.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.360]   Who can say anything to you?
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.880]   But I guess the Secret Service probably can.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.520]   Now, the people who chat with guns,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.200]   it's probably a good idea to listen to them,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.480]   because they're responsible for you to keep you alive.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.280]   Heads of state.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.680]   Be it the president or the pope.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.960]   Always have people who have been in that job longer.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.160]   They know all the details and all the dirty parts.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.240]   And they get to call the shots.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   Believe it or not, it's not like being a CEO of a company.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.600]   If you're CEO of a company, you really
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.680]   can't do anything within that company.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.240]   But like--
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.400]   Well, he's not the boss.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.480]   He works for us.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.000]   Yes.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.800]   Yes.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.000]   And I think that that becomes very clear at some point, right?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.400]   Well, I mean, if you look at Saturday versus Friday,
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.480]   Friday was the inauguration.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.240]   Saturday was the Women's March.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.280]   I mean, I think the fifth largest Women's March
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.520]   was bigger than the inauguration got, right?
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.680]   So-- and that occurred across the country.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.080]   What's very interesting about the Trump situation is,
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.440]   one of the big concerns with Trump
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.760]   is that his brand and his name are one and the same.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.560]   He has all these hotels and obviously
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.480]   is double dealing in all kinds of real estate projects
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.480]   around the world that he is going to benefit from,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.680]   from being president.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.440]   And he hasn't put everything in a blind trust.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.800]   He's got it in his son's trust.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   Although, that's pretty close to being blind in my mind.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.960]   He actually said nothing.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.160]   He said he was going to do all this.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.280]   No, I mean, he's done nothing.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.920]   He's done nothing.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.440]   None of it.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.400]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.960]   However, but I will stick to the tech on this.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.920]   On the tech, he is going to gain at least 20, maybe 50 million
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.200]   followers.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.240]   You talked on the same--
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.240]   And that's worth $1 or $2 a seat.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.600]   Here's a quantifiable value to Twitter followers.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.320]   When marketers pay for Twitter followers,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.360]   there's a weight in the--
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   A multiplier.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.680]   Just that.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.320]   You can just say, I want to gain followers.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.240]   I'm willing to pay $1, I'm willing to pay $2.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.080]   So when he gains 20, 30, 40 million people,
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.400]   he's going to be making, let's say,
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.840]   20 to $100 million asset, which when he gets out of office--
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.560]   But he can't take @potus with him.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.080]   And so this is one of the interesting things.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.400]   I was told that along with taking the phone,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.800]   they said, and Mr. President, you must now
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.640]   tweet @potus and not real Donald Trump.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.320]   That's not happening.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.240]   And that did not happen.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.400]   That's not going to happen at school.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.280]   It did not happen.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.760]   So he continues to tweet at both, although @potus, which
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   has 14.2 million followers, seems to be the kind of tweets
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.520]   that came during the campaign from the iPhone.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.560]   During the day, the staffer tweets.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   Yes, and then there was the five tweets.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560]   There's those spelling errors.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.360]   That tipped it off.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.760]   Well, there was a spelling error.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.640]   This one originally.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.680]   I am honored to serve you.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.760]   Was spelled with an ER.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.760]   No, wait a second.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.040]   But fixed.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.920]   Is he-- does that mean he actually
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.080]   is the president is literally writing his own tweets?
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.840]   The people who work for him are incapable of using spell check.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.320]   They say that any tweets that he writes will be signed DT.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.640]   I don't think that's true.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.760]   I'm looking at real Donald Trump.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.960]   I see no signature at all.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.400]   No, no, only on the POTUS account.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.680]   So on the POTUS account, if there's anything that actually
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.680]   comes from him, he'll be signed DT.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.840]   Is it to be presumed that real Donald Trump, then these
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.920]   are his tweets?
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.720]   Well, then there were some--
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.960]   somewhere he said that he would read them out to a staffer
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.200]   and they would write them.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.840]   But then it's like, you have a staffer there at 3 AM?
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.880]   Well, and does this new phone--
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.840]   because remember when Obama got a phone in 2013,
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.440]   a couple of years ago, he complained on the tonight show.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.520]   It doesn't play music.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.840]   It doesn't take pictures.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.880]   It doesn't do any of the things in normal smartphone.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.200]   He said, it's your child.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:38.720]   It's a kid.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.120]   It's a play phone.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.000]   I would be surprised if it would tweet.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.440]   I would--
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.680]   I would--
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   I would--
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.200]   I would-- he's going to browser on that, though.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.120]   Well, does not have a browser.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.560]   I do not believe it has a browser.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.680]   It's a device that's designed for secure communication
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.600]   should never touch an insecure network.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.280]   Precisely.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.960]   And that's--
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.560]   So it doesn't go on the public internet
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.880]   or if it does, it goes through a--
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.680]   Does it filter?
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.600]   --that makes sure that he's not getting fizzed on whatever.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.720]   So much--
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.800]   I wonder maybe he did keep the galaxy in a drawer.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.960]   And he's pointed out.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.400]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   But clearly, he's still tweeting on Real Donald Trump,
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   which has considerably more followers, 21 and 1/2 million
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.480]   followers.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.600]   There was also a little kerfuffle because for a while--
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.960]   and Twitter says it was about 50,000 people--
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.880]   were autofollowed to @potus.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.120]   Oh, it was more than 50,000.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.280]   Well, that's not a--
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.440]   Twitter said it was 50.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.400]   It seemed like it must have been.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.800]   Well, because when they moved over the account,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.000]   Potus had 14.5 million.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.200]   It had dropped to under 14 million.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   Then it went up to 14.5.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   Then it went down to 14.1.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   Now it stabilized at 14.2.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   Because people were unsubscribing an anticipation
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   of Trump taking it.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   Right.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.200]   Right.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   Therefore, when they did the migration,
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   some of those people who had unsubscribed--
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   Or recently.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   --were resubscribed.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   Right.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   Also known as No Big Deal.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   And B.D.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   Right.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   Well, it's a button.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   You could push it.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   To it exactly.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   They were replaying the script.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   They were subsequently going back to a backup--
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.800]   And then saying, OK, it took a while to replay that script.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   It's also apologized.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   It wasn't intentional.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   And who cares?
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.800]   I mean, it's--
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.200]   Well, I would care if Twitter were throwing its hat in the ring and saying, well, you
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.800]   all ought to follow Donald Trump.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   Right.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   But it was people who had free business.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   Yeah, it's just an accident.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.000]   I mean, people are so quick on Twitter and in other places to sort of ascribe some sort
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   of agenda.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.400]   But in fact, almost all of Twitter's behavior comes out of just their utter incompetence.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   Right?
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.000]   Like, is there anybody left at Twitter?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.400]   Well, either nine of the topics I love those is you.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.240]   They lost everybody.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.280]   And if you have a halftime CEO-- and listen, Jack's a friend of mine-- or acquaintance/friend
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.920]   of mine, I consider him a friendly.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.640]   I don't want to be critical of Jack, but it is a horrible idea to--
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   Because somebody's going to tweet him if you say anything about it.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.640]   Well, anyway, whatever.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.560]   I mean, he knows my position, which is a halftime CEO of a troubled company.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.000]   So he doesn't really step down at Square.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   He's still running Square.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.960]   Yeah, and now we're six quarters in.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.520]   I mean, I think the halftime CEO experiment's going to end in the next 60 to, you know,
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.520]   whatever 180--
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.040]   The board's transformed too though, right?
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   It's not the same board.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.200]   They transferred some of the board.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   But you know--
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.720]   Isn't that who would then force Jack to step down?
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:13.160]   I think, you know, again, the incompetence level on the board as well is just so bad.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.880]   Like, it's really run imma--
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.880]   What happens to Twitter?
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.280]   I mean, clearly, we just spent 20 minutes talking about the president's Twitter account.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.360]   It's clearly an important medium.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:28.000]   It's important, but the only way to keep Twitter as an important medium is to basically guarantee
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.400]   that it's never profitable.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   That's a problem.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   This is a thing.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   It's going to get bought up by a bunch of vaults--
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   Should it be in nonprofit?
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   --a bunch of companies.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.640]   And they'll go and try and run it at a profit and kill it.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.640]   Is the way I say it.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.640]   Should it be in nonprofit?
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.640]   Should it be in nonprofit?
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.480]   What would you like in this to a public utility?
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.080]   This is like PBS back in the day.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.200]   This was an important public service.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.240]   Actually, even way more important than PBS.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.600]   And it needs to stay free.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.040]   It needs to stay more or less free flowing.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.720]   The minute that someone figures out a really good way to monetize Twitter, it's no longer
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   Twitter.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   There is a security concern.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   Somebody just raised this.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.000]   What happens when North Korea hacks the president's account and starts tweeting and could they even
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   create a war?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   No.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Could we--
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   No.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   --pay enough attention in this house?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   We've seen this before with the Syrian electronic army.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.960]   They got hold of-- it was AP's tweet.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   They pushed out.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.120]   There'd been a bomb attack in the White House.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.120]   You got a flash crash.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.880]   It was straight back up again within a few minutes.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   People understand this.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   We can be-- and they can be the Australian army.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.880]   Right?
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.880]   We have a pretty educated podcast.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.040]   Yeah, but Trump's tweets, he's caused Boeing, Lockheed.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.040]   He's caused a lot of companies.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.040]   That's the real value.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   That's the real value.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.400]   Someone hacks the account and then they sell short on a company that they have.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   Well, the accounts--
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.400]   You're being caught real quick.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.720]   What's really interesting about the Lockheed cases, if you look at the pattern of shared
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.920]   traffic, the Lockheed share price started to drop sharply about five minutes before that
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   tweet went out.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   You'll get one.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   You'll get caught real quick.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.400]   I mean, the thing that's fascinating is hard to get away with, right?
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   I think it pretty--
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   They know who bought the stock.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.760]   The only thing you could really do is take a long-term view.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.680]   So, OK, I'm going to load up on Twitter because I know it's going to be required and
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.760]   I'm going to take a long view.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.080]   But it's very hard to trade on that information now.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.640]   What's interesting about Twitter, I think, is never before have we had as polarizing a
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.920]   politician as Trump.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   I mean, maybe Nixon.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.840]   I don't know when the last time was this polarized.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   Nixon's pretty close.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.560]   I wasn't alive during it.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.080]   So here's the thing.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:29.400]   If Twitter can't grow, meaningfully, when the president of the United States is using
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   it to start and create chaos, when will they ever be able to grow?
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.400]   Well, I think--
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   If we had to--
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.840]   If we had to do some kind of dodgy stuff.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   Because Trump's--
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.880]   Honestly, I don't think going to risk the presidency on something as stupid as a living
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   inside of trading.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.720]   I do have to say, a lot of people were-- I noticed a lot of people in my various feeds
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.200]   were saying we're wanting to watch the march yesterday.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   And watched on Twitter.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.240]   So there is a use case for live Twitter.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.760]   Twitter is an incredibly successful company that has been mismanaged for the last couple
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   of years.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.680]   It hasn't been managed for growth.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.920]   And it's just gone sideways.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.720]   And you just-- these companies are so competitive.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.680]   If you look at how Zuckerberg runs his company, he is so competitive that to be halftime CEO,
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.760]   it just doesn't work.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   It just doesn't work.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.480]   And I mean, I've been saying it from the beginning.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.880]   Everybody else has been saying it.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.880]   It was a mistake.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.680]   But what's going wrong at Twitter?
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   They just can't monetize?
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   The product--
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   No, no.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   They have plenty of revenue.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680]   They can't grow.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.440]   The product is not getting easier to use.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.760]   And there's no product cadence.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.680]   So product cadence means in the technology spaces that on a regular basis, you're getting
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.920]   nice updates.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.120]   You see Facebook runs their FA conference.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.280]   They run a regular-- you see regular updates with their products.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.520]   Microsoft, Google, everybody's got regular updates.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.160]   You don't get that sense as a Twitter user.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.320]   If any kind of rhyme or reason--
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.000]   There's never a new invitation for a new generation of users or new generation developers.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.600]   And they've got a very mature marketplace.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.200]   And there's a limited number of people who are now looking to sign on and increase their
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   numbers growth.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.400]   So they've got a real problem.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.920]   And every time they try and muck around with the actual service, the users throw up a complete
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.920]   stink.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.520]   And they either back down or they wind it down.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.160]   I mean, Facebook used to do this.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.160]   They'd introduce a change.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.040]   The users would go, this is the worst thing ever.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.320]   And then they started off rolling it back.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.680]   And then they just decided, hell with it.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   We're going to do it anyway.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.240]   And they can either go away or they can come along with us.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.480]   And they come along with you in Facebook by and large.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.480]   I think--
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.160]   You do have to say that because of President Trump being on there,
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   that's kind of going to guarantee Twitter continues.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.360]   Twitter is going to continue.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.600]   I mean, these things take a long time to deprecate.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.720]   So if you look at AOL or Yahoo, I mean, these brands still exist even today, even though
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.200]   they haven't done anything innovative in a decade.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   So it'll stick around.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   It'll stick around.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   It's on Twitter pretty much perfect.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   Couldn't they just leave it the way it is?
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Like, thing.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   Here's what's going to happen.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.440]   They're going to cut more staff, clean it up, and then sell it.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.560]   And the only problem is Jack has, I think, a little bit of a strong grip on the board.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.680]   And he wants to keep going.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.680]   He wants to keep innovating.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.120]   It's an ego thing for him.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.120]   He's the founder.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.960]   You think we're in a Jerry Yang situation?
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.960]   A bit.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.280]   And I think somebody's got to just say to him, like, listen, you had eight quarters.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280]   It didn't happen.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.280]   Nothing happened.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.960]   It's time for us to sell this.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.160]   Cut half the staff and sell.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.120]   If Yahoo had cut half the staff at some point and focused on their--
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.400]   And who will buy this?
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   Some venture capital?
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   Well, there's been a--
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   Investment--
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.880]   There have been investor groups that have tried to talk them into doing this, but they
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.120]   can't do it unless Jack and certain board members and key shareholders agree.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   So there's plenty of people who want to privatize it.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.320]   Should you do a hostile takeover?
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.320]   No.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.320]   Why not?
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.320]   Because I don't think their float is big enough.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.120]   The amount of shares available to the public is not big enough.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.120]   And you have these private--
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   They kept enough in the side.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.960]   So you really have to get a majority stack.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   And they have another option.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   And they have an extra coal by Twitter.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   Can you make some kind of--
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.560]   I mean, listen, at 20 or 30 billion, it doesn't feel like--
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.480]   Anybody wanted to buy it, but at 10 billion or 8 billion--
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.480]   There's a price.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.480]   There's a price.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480]   There's a lot of people who buy it.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.480]   So you've got your angel hat on right now.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.560]   How would you extract your money back out of Twitter if you had invested a large--
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.600]   Well, I mean, people who were involved sold their shares to Chris Saka, who ran syndicates
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.440]   of secondary shares all the way up.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.120]   So that's how Chris Saka made all his money.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.840]   And he'll make his future thing on the Uber bet.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.360]   But at the time, what he did was he put a pool of capital together, went to them and
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.560]   said, anybody who's an ex-employee, I'll buy your shares or current employee so you
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.000]   can get some liquidity and buy a house.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.280]   That's when it was a billion dollar company, $2 billion company.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.200]   Ran all the way up to a $45 billion company.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   So some people--
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   A lot of people got rich.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   A lot of people we know.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   A lot of people did OK.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   Yeah, a lot of people did OK.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.840]   So there's that ability to sell the shares.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.640]   But I think that there is an opportunity-- I know this sounds crazy-- for somebody to
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.640]   create another social network that is based on privacy.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640]   What?
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.640]   What?
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.640]   And--
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.640]   We're not done?
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.640]   No.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.200]   Listen, Google was the 12th search engine, right?
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.400]   Or 13th search engine of the--
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.960]   So there's always an opportunity.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.560]   I think that somebody could create a Twitter competitor if they did it based on mobile
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.640]   first and based in the same way Signal is encrypted and secure.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.000]   We just have verified users.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.520]   I think you could go one of two ways.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.720]   You can go only verified to be on the system so you get better behavior.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.240]   Or you could go complete free for all.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.960]   We don't control anything.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.360]   It's more like BitTorrent or it's a little bit more open and nobody controls it.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.120]   Why can't you combine those?
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.680]   Don't you fix most of the troll problem if everybody is verified?
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.800]   If you've got your actual identity in the game, you are much less likely to--
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   That's what they're--
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.720]   It won't stop some people.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.640]   But, I mean, you know who they are.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.480]   That's what they're moving towards that.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.200]   That's why they opened up the verification process.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.640]   There has been a movement inside the company to go 100% verified.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.640]   It was a very strong--
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.640]   Last time you were here, you said that was going to happen.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.640]   Well, and you saw it happen, right?
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.120]   They did say we're going to open it up to everybody who can request it.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.600]   So I was right again.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.840]   And it's easy to be right when people are feeding you information.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.640]   But yeah, it's definitely--
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.680]   I think eventually what will happen is the default on Twitter will be verified people.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.040]   So after a certain number of people tip over, they'll say your experience is verified.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.160]   And what I asked Jack to do, and what I told Twitter they should do is when somebody has
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.200]   a flag on their account, too many complaints like a milo or something, when they come up
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.880]   and they want to harass you and they're like, "Hey, Atleo, hey, Atpadre."
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.040]   You know, and it should come up blurred.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   And it should say unverified user or controversial user.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.640]   It should be blurred.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.760]   And then it says click to reveal.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.480]   You click to reveal it and it automatically has a box there, block or reporting.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.160]   So you're basically saying you can get put in the penalty box if too many people complain
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.640]   and the cost of being in the penalty box is your tweets are blurred.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.640]   Then you have to approve people to say in the future--
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.640]   I guess we're in a--
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.800]   I don't think that solves the problem.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.760]   It solves one part of the problem which is you don't want to see trolls.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.720]   But trolls can do you damage by the tweets that they say to other people.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.720]   They can damage you.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.240]   And that doesn't change that situation at all.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.120]   But if a-- let's say there's a triggering mechanism, a thousand people who are qualified,
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.360]   verified people say this person is horrible, then maybe they just move to every tweet they
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.360]   do is--
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   It's a tough thing to solve.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.360]   I don't think that--
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   Well, Facebook did a good job of only having--
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.800]   It's all use-
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   It's all use-
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   Supposis.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   It does-- it's dramatic the difference between Facebook and--
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.320]   Because you can report people and then they go away.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.640]   You can't really put up a fake account on Facebook.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.640]   It's very hard to maintain.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.640]   It's much more work.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.640]   Much more than a triad.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.200]   It's too much doable, but it is a little lie.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.360]   You have to really make effort because every time you add somebody, if you don't know them,
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.520]   it's like, I don't know this person and this isn't a real person.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.560]   And they immediately get the signal.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.560]   Let's take a break, come back with us.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.560]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   Lots.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.840]   Putting a new chairman of the FCC, Apple suing Qualcomm for $1 billion.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   Yum.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   And, well, lots more.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   We'll get to it in just a moment.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.840]   First, let's have snacks.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   It's snack time.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.840]   We don't want to do it early today.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.520]   Nature box, they've been our snack providers since 2010.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.520]   We love nature box.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.960]   What do you do when you want a snack?
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.920]   But all you can find is crap, junk food.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.360]   They're self-control, right?
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   That works.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.360]   Resist temptation.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   No.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.360]   No control of that.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   Please.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.360]   I've heard it.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.360]   Never did it.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.360]   What do you do?
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.360]   You eat the crap.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.360]   Here's what you do.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.160]   Nature box, handy, ready.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.240]   And you're going to have wonderful snacks that taste great.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   They fulfill your need.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.600]   Look at that big island pineapple.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.120]   That is the best fried fruit in the history of the world.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.280]   It's chewy and then delicious and garlic plantains.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   What the what?
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.840]   Cranberry almond bites.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.600]   Whole wheat raspberry figgy bars.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.080]   I'll never forget the day.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.440]   Sarellane ate an entire bag of those.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.440]   Mini Belgian waffles.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.440]   Oh, I love those.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440]   Those are really, really good.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   Really, really good.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.160]   Always high quality ingredients.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.640]   Yeah, the sriracha.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   Free from artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.520]   If you've tried nature box before, they've changed it a little bit and this is what I've
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   wanted.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.520]   You can order as much as you want, as often as you want.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   So there used to be a subscription.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.000]   You'd get a box.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.080]   It was complicated to get more now, but no, no minimum purchase.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.280]   Cancel any time.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.000]   Get as much as you want.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.640]   There are over 100 snacks.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.600]   They always are refining it, always improving it based on, you know, they've got a lot of
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   data.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.920]   They know what people like.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.960]   One of the reasons is you can return a snack if you don't like it and they'll replace it
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.960]   for free.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.960]   That's their research.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   No risk.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   No risk.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.280]   It's hosted Sesame Sticks.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   And you could get those.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.280]   Yeah, sure.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   You go to the store and get them.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.280]   They're not as good.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.280]   They're not as convenient.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.720]   Well, you don't want to think about the sea salt pop pops.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   Ooh, yum yum.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   Certainly.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   Okay, stop.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   Stop showing this.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   I'm going to stop showing this.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   I'm going to go to the vinegium.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   Choose the snacks you want at naturebox.com/twit.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.360]   We're going to give you 50% off your first order right now.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.360]   Oh, come on.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.560]   Now what's holding you back?
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.000]   Naturebox.com/twit, 50% off your first order.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.520]   We thank naturebox for their long time support.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.040]   They've been keeping us as snacks forever.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.600]   Naturebox.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.600]   So this is just a rumor.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.320]   This is not yet been confirmed by the Trump administration, but there are several sources
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:25.600]   of reported to Politico that one of the current commissioners of the FCC, Ajit Pai, will become
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.280]   chairman of the FCC.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:34.320]   As you know, the FCC was told, don't make any more rules until the new administration
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.320]   comes in.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.000]   It is up to the president to appoint the new commissioners, half have to be Republican,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.040]   half Democratic.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.960]   We all already know that Tom Wheeler, who was an Obama appointee, is gone.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.280]   And Ajit Pai is an interesting choice because he is already a commissioner.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.680]   He does not need Senate approval.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.800]   He can go right into the work.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   He was already confirmed.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.040]   Now that's just for the term.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.440]   He would have to be reconfirmed when the new term comes up.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.600]   Pai was a nominee by Obama.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.600]   He is a Republican.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.640]   In fact, he's a senior FCC Republican.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.080]   But here's the thing that I find interesting.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:18.000]   He is a rabid anti-net neutrality, a fierce critic of net neutrality, of many regulations
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.800]   that the commission has passed over the last few years, not just net neutrality, but a
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.920]   lot more.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.280]   He will at least be acting chairman, I think.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.280]   And we'll see if he becomes a more permanent chairman.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:38.920]   But this has always been on the Trump plan to get rid of regulation.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.760]   And in particular, the net neutrality regulation.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:47.600]   Yeah, basically just about wraps it up for net neutrality at the moment, because if you
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.560]   read what this guy has been writing for the last three or four years, and the talks he
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.600]   gives to various think tanks about the way, net neutrality is out.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.680]   Any kind of laws against conglomeration of broadband ownership, they're out.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.040]   Of course, if you're trying to set up your own municipal network, that's out as well,
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.320]   because he's not a big fan of those.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.760]   It has to be done by a good thing.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:12.680]   Did you see, by the way, speaking of municipal networks, the proposed bill in, I think it's
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.600]   Wisconsin or Minneapolis?
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:22.000]   Oh, for the, you can't have a municipal network if you can get a 10 megabit connection through
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   any means possible.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.200]   So if you have a satellite down, you can't get a digital.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   Yeah, no, that's no.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   We can't have that.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:33.920]   It's just, so there's already in many state legislatures and cities, rules against cities
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.880]   setting up Wi-Fi.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.760]   I think it's a great idea, but I think the Republican point of view is that the public
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.040]   sector should not compete against private enterprise.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.480]   Well, hang on, what are they afraid of?
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.000]   One is either more efficient than the other.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.480]   So it goes back to the competition.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.720]   It's the '86 Cable Act.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.800]   So in the '86 Cable Act, in order to entice companies to come in and actually deploy,
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.000]   they basically said, we're going to give you the rights to set up connectivity across
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   a municipality.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.880]   However, there is a clause in there.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   It is part of the bill.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.640]   It's not just an interpretation that says it needs to be for the betterment of the community.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.960]   Unfortunately, it's so vaguely written that you can argue that locking you out of a faster
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.440]   connection is serving the betterment of the community.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.720]   But looking at the whole thing, the net neutrality, the interesting part here is, yes, they could
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   roll it back.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.440]   They could get rid of the regulation.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.120]   However, the hard part of setting up net neutrality the way that we had it under Wheeler
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.960]   was the reclassification.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   And the argument of whether or not that should be allowed, even if they roll back the regulation,
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.920]   when the next administration comes across, if they are friendly to the net neutrality
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.360]   regulations, it's not going to be an eight-year fight.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.800]   It's going to be a two-month fight because they're going to say, the president is already
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.640]   there, that this is possible.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.280]   We can reclassify it.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.800]   And once we have the votes, we do.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.280]   So this ultimately is Congress.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   Ultimately, it's Congress.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.280]   No matter what.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   No matter what.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   Then the hard part was already done.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.960]   Here's what Pi wrote in September, he wrote a digital empowerment agenda.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.960]   So I'm just curious.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.360]   We'll go through these four points.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.360]   What do you think?
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.040]   First, I mean, some of this I'd say, great, gigabit opportunity zones to bring broadband
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.920]   and digital opportunity to their most economic and challenged areas, create these zones that
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.680]   would incentivize broadband deployment, spur local governments to streamline regulations,
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.680]   help job creators.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.640]   In other words, help business revitalize neighborhoods.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.920]   Any area where the average household income is below 75% of the national medium would
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:34.840]   qualify, state and local lawmakers would adopt streamlined broadband deployment-friendly
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.200]   policies.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.760]   Probably that's a euphemism.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.760]   Significant tax incentives, entrepreneurs instead advise to create jobs in these zones
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.840]   through a tax credit.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.400]   Sounds like a good thing, right?
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.400]   Can't argue.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.400]   Details are.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   Mobile broadband for rural America.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.880]   I mean, this is one of the things we've called for for a long time.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.920]   It's clear that businesses, one of the problems, of course, in this country is that a business
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:03.200]   is less incentivized to provide internet to a very low density population, a rural population.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.840]   Yeah, people are still on satellites.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.000]   So we've got to do something, in my opinion, like the rural electrification programs of
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.800]   the compression, they did that to bring electricity to areas that would not be powered.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.760]   Let's bring broadband that way.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:22.640]   He proposes, increase the build out obligations of wireless carriers and incentivize rural
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.000]   broadband investment by extending license terms up to 15 years, move forward with a
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.160]   mobility fund phase to the includes tech, neutral performance metrics, eliminates duplicative
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   support.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   I don't even know what we're talking about.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.240]   Maintains support where it's needed, subsidizes the deployment of new networks, create a real
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   dividend.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   So basically incentives.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:46.120]   This is a copy of the plan they tried to implement in the early 2000s when they gave
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.360]   the telco industry $200 billion to build out rural internet.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.360]   Right.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.360]   And how did that work?
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.360]   Exactly.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.360]   And fine.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.360]   There has to be stronger language that says, you only get the money if you actually do
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   it.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.840]   You want to set it to 10% of the money from spectrum auctions to deploy mobile broadband
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   in the neighborhood.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.760]   You see, I'm all for incentives, but incentives have to be backed up by penalties.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.960]   So if you take the money and you don't perform, you give it back.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.040]   Well, otherwise it's just a gift.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   It's here.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   Here's a couple hundred billion.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:21.480]   The good news is SpaceX with their 4,000 satellites going up in low Earth orbit is going
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.360]   to have a system that's going to be a gigabit.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.360]   And it's going to be cheap.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.360]   And there's one web.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.280]   I think it's the other one that's doing it.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.280]   We're trying to do it.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.800]   Essentially, it's like a pizza box size dish you put anywhere.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.160]   And then boom, you're all set up.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.240]   And that's going to be here in two or three years, I think.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.000]   And when that happens, I think we're going to see...
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.520]   We definitely need some disruption.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.760]   It's going to be very disruptive.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:54.920]   Because the whole concept of upstate New York or some rural place, Montana, it's going
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.960]   to have gigabit over satellites.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.200]   And there's going to be multiple providers doing this.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   That's going to be interesting.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.440]   And Radium just put up a bunch of satellites in the last SpaceX launch.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:07.960]   So you're going to have multiple people putting up arrays of internet from this...
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.120]   This plan is a bad idea.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.680]   The idea is get government out of the way, give some incentive to private industry to
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.040]   do this.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.960]   What you would expect from a Republican administration as opposed to a government funding...
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.800]   A form of rise and learn.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   And a form of rise and learn.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.600]   But let's build the horizon.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.120]   Because remember, when Wheeler came in, we thought, "Oh, he is the towel boy for the
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.120]   cable industry."
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.120]   Right, right.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.120]   And it turned completely out.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.120]   These are not unreasonable.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.480]   If, as you say, the companies take this money and actually do this, take these incentives,
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.040]   the tax credits, he has things like he doesn't...
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.560]   Government officials, I think this is great, should adopt a dig once policy so that whenever
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.080]   you do a highway or a road construction project, you'll lay conduit for broadband.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.440]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.080]   I think a lot of this makes sense.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.600]   I mean, it's time to try another approach.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   Well, possibly.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.200]   What worries me more about this guy is that he is perfectly willing for telcos to mega
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   merge.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   And that just reduces competition.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:07.680]   And that's funny because Trump said during the campaign that he was against the time
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:14.800]   Warner merger with AT&T, he said, "We're going to stop that."
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.680]   But this guy, clearly, his position would be...
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.080]   No, no, no.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.920]   His position is he's never met a merger that he didn't lie.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.920]   So, you know, I mean, Trump did say that.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.280]   Trump said a lot of things in the campaign.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.120]   Now we've got to see whether he'd match some to it.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.120]   If he does, great.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.120]   You know, he'll get my full support.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.960]   But I've got my doubts, put it that way.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.720]   Somebody in the chart room was asking about the latency issue with the satellites.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.960]   The new satellites are low Earth orbit, so they are closer to the Earth, which means
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.360]   they can cover a smaller amount of area.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.480]   They're Leo's, which I happen to like.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:51.800]   So, 25 to 35 milliseconds is what I've read as opposed to 600 milliseconds.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.200]   So that whole idea of you load a webpage, you wait, and then boom, it comes in.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   That kind of goes away.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.600]   It's just like wired, supposedly.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   We'll see.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.600]   Well, I'm thrilled that...
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.000]   Indeed, many more satellites, you know.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.440]   Elon is a really good example of how the private sector can really innovate, do some
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.680]   amazing things.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.600]   Like outside the box.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.000]   I wouldn't trust Comcast for Ryzen or AT&T to do this.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   No.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.520]   But if there's competition, if they try, and Elon tries, I would trust the free market
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.520]   to generate a solution that works for a world.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.800]   Free market generates great solutions, so long as you've got a free market.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   We don't right now.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.080]   One of the really astounding things about moving to this country, because America is
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.240]   billed as the home of competition and the free market, the cut and thrust of free market
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.240]   capitalism.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:38.960]   You've got one of the most monopolized, dual-folized markets in the world for things like telecommunications,
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960]   for health care.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.520]   Yeah, it's wacky.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.360]   It's not even close to being a free market, and that's why you need to have someone in
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.560]   there as an arbiter of things saying, "Right, if you're going to have a proper free market,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.920]   you can't manipulate markets in this way."
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.320]   There's actually a policy that the FCC is dealing, can deal with.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.440]   That is more important than net neutrality if we really do want that competition.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:04.320]   That is to protect and expand the act that they passed the week after net neutrality
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.480]   that got so little play, and that opened up the polls.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.040]   It made it much easier for a non-income to come in and deploy broadband.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:18.280]   If they expand that, because it's been challenged by AT&T, very heavily challenged, if they uphold
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   that, and they allow a sonic net to come in and use less than $5,000 per house, because
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.320]   that's the number the CEO of Sonic quoted.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.080]   He said, "Whether or not we're running to a house, it costs us $5,000 per house in San
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.840]   Francisco to run.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.640]   If they can reduce that significantly to even $500 a house, then suddenly you do have competition."
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.360]   Well, let's go a step further.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.400]   Let's open up the cable company's physical plans to competition.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.480]   It's not just the cable company that can use the copper, but just as it works on phone
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.760]   companies right now, where you could have multiple DSL providers running on those lines.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.640]   It could do other countries like South Korea have done, is actually have the government
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.760]   build out a massive fiber network and open it up and say, "Go play.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.280]   Let's see what competition brings."
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.320]   That's, frankly, with a solution I'd like to see.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.800]   That's completely a non-starter under this administration.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.040]   No, never get a high.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.760]   Well, I mean, talking about a 2 billion infrastructure bill, if you're going to be spending that
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.480]   kind of much, the money that's in the infrastructure plan I read, that 2 billion is almost all private
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.720]   industry, which then gets to monetize by charging a toll.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.040]   At least for broadband, it would be a duplicate of what we already have.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.800]   So we'll see.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   Interesting talk to that.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.840]   One of the interesting things I've seen, I've gotten this proposal a bunch of times as an
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.760]   angel investor, is people doing crowdfunding for fiber.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.640]   So you have a provider who says, "Hey, I want to put this in a building."
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.360]   And they say, "Yeah, just get us 15 people in your building to say, 'Yes, we'll run
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   the fiber.'"
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   Right.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:48.920]   And then people at some buildings now are putting their own internet into the building
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.320]   as a way to draw people to the building.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:56.760]   So if you want to sell in a luxury building now to millennials, you just basically get
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.120]   a huge fiber connection.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:03.680]   You say, "We give Wi-Fi up to this amount for $10 a month or included."
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   And then you can actually get fiber drops into your building.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.240]   In Germany, it's a major factor in house prices at the moment.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.040]   They're actually, in fact, they reckon if you get a fast fiber internet connection into
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.280]   a house, you can raise the value of that house by three or four percent.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.280]   Make sense.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.840]   I wouldn't buy a house without ice heating it.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.320]   All right, Apple.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.760]   Let's take a break, then we'll do Apple.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.760]   For sure.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.760]   We still want snacks.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.760]   Do we look?
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.760]   You know what?
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.760]   I think they ate them all.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.760]   They're all there.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.760]   They ate them all.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   They're gone.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   We were here late on Friday and we kind of went through the whole box.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.600]   Oh, yay, yada.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.040]   Father Robert Ballis there.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.040]   He ate all the snacks.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.280]   He's also the digital Jesuit.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.640]   You'll see him on KnowHow.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.600]   And this weekend at Enterprise 10, Jason Calicanis from inside.com.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.600]   And what was it?
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   Calicanis texts?
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   Jason's text list.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.680]   The thing, I'll give one plug.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.760]   You don't want to plug it though.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.760]   Inside.com/Trump.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.760]   We started.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.360]   Oh, you got a Trump newsletter?
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.360]   Well, we did.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.360]   It's an experiment.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.200]   We're basically looking at everything he promised before the election.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.440]   And then we're going to just track what he promised and then what he actually does.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.760]   And so it's not partisan.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.960]   It's just he promised X or he promised X, Y and Z. And here's how he's tracking against
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   that promise.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.960]   And it's a model for inside now.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.360]   There's a lot of verticals, right?
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.280]   We're going to do 50 new verticals this year.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.560]   We have 14 right now.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.560]   So every topic.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.880]   I want to join technically Sentient.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.960]   Technically Sentient is really great.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.480]   That's one of our fastest growing.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.160]   It's got 12,000 emails on it.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.720]   It's just about AI and machine learning twice a week.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.720]   A friend of mine.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.960]   So do you just hire one person for each newsletter to do that?
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.600]   Yeah, a full time person can do two to three newsletters if they're two to three.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.920]   It basically takes five, six, seven hours to do a great visit.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.640]   Most are twice a week, sometimes three.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.120]   And then some we're doing twice a day.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.040]   So the idea is just to make you smarter.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.680]   Ooh, read this thing.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   You read this thing.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.680]   I like that.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   We bought that.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.360]   It was a 15,000 person email newsletter where it's one story a day.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.360]   One great story a day.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.840]   Sort of like long reads or something.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.400]   Here's a high quality one.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.760]   And so we just did inside Facebook this week.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:11.360]   So just, you know, everybody just reporting on and recapping what happened on Facebook.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.200]   I am overwhelmed by the amount of great content that's out there.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.320]   We have no lack of great.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.040]   And that's what we're trying to do here is like basically curate that and say curation.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.080]   Just, you know, here's the top 10 stories about Facebook in the last four days.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.760]   If you were involved in Facebook in some way as a stakeholder, read it.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.720]   But we will only need you to sign up for two or three.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.360]   You don't have to sign up for 50.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.360]   Just two.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   Just pick a couple.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   Three.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   That's all.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.360]   It's free, right?
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   Yeah, it's free.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   It's going to be classified and then eventually patronage based.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.480]   We're building the CMS now.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.200]   So eventually 1% of people will be able to pay or 2% will be able to pay as a thank you.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   Patrean, just I think.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   You're working through Patreon or you actually doing it.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.600]   No, we've done some tests on Patreon.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.840]   I think we're going to build it into our own system.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.840]   Okay.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.280]   You know, my whole playbook is to build the CMS and make a whole machine.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.160]   So when you do it for one newsletter, you establish a best practice like we did for web
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.160]   blogs, Inc.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.120]   We had a best practice for Engadget that then went over to Auto blog in joystick.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.720]   So if we establish the best practice on inside Trump, then it goes right to the AI newsletter
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   and the drones newsletter and everything else.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   Okay.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.040]   But you have to figure it out.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.360]   So it's still hard.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.480]   And finally Ian, media is hard.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.640]   Thompson of the register code.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.640]   Register.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   UK.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.920]   It's been harder to get him up here, ever since the British store closed.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.920]   Ah, no.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.960]   Well, I'm not by most of my British food on Amazon to be honest because I can get in
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   bulk.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.960]   So that's my...
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.960]   Including that beef jerky?
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.960]   I don't know.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   I don't think like bulk bangers.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.960]   But that's Australian.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.960]   No, no, it's South Africa and I bought...
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   It is British food.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.960]   Like South Africa.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.960]   Not caramel.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   Not caramel.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.680]   It's tea that tastes like tea, not the sweet pan.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.320]   Can of yellowy, whitish substance called custard.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.080]   You ever want to put yeast on toast?
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.080]   No.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.080]   Is that Vegemite?
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   No, no.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.840]   Vegemite is the bastardized version of it from Australia.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.840]   Why are they being rich?
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   It's one good deal.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.840]   Fish and chips.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   There's one that may get around.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   Fish and chips.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.840]   Everything else?
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.840]   Bangers and mashed.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.840]   I will not.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.840]   No.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.840]   No.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   Come on.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   I'm going to put some of these on it.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.560]   Did they not with sharp cheddar cheese?
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.720]   No, that's an American abomination.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:14.160]   Yeah, I think that was taxi driver, Leo.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:19.080]   I think that was taxi driver before he tried to assassinate the president.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.840]   I ordered a slice of apple pie with American cheese on it and I thought that was a great
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.840]   selection.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.960]   And remember, kippers and custard.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:27.960]   It was really disturbing.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.200]   It's so much more to it.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.680]   Think kéjorie, for example.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.480]   I try not to think of kéjorie whenever possible.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   It's like...
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.480]   It's bubble and squeak.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   Oh, bubble and squeak.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   It's bubble and squeak.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.800]   The full English, the magnificence of a full English breakfast.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.000]   How can you turn that down?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Very easily.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Very ex-sophage.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.760]   Fried mushrooms pudding.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.200]   Maybe some liveriness on the side.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.200]   Black pudding.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   Wow.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   I'm just...
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   You know why it's bad?
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.200]   Literally none of us.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   Have you had it?
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   Have you actually had it?
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.200]   Of course I've had it.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   Fine.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   Oh, good.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   Great way.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   English food is terrible.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   Marame.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   You guys...
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   I bow to the nation that gave us the Twinkie for goodness.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   Don't knock the Twinkie.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   That's good.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   That's good.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   Spine words.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   Yeah, the Googoo cluster.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   That's ours, baby.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.360]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.760]   Keep track of your...
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   You know, all right.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.760]   A little experiment.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.400]   You're a sole proprietor, a small business maybe.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.120]   Can you tell me if 2016 was profitable?
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.320]   Are you in profit right now?
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.480]   Usually you don't know that till you do your taxes.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.320]   Like once a year you go, "Ah, now I know."
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   Not an idea.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   A little less money.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320]   FreshBooks, you know all the time.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   You know, you're a new dashboard.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.320]   This is brand new redesign.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:41.520]   Knows what invoices you're out, what invoices have been paid, what your expenses are, what
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.720]   your profit is, and you can see it at every moment.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.480]   You know how you're doing without any accounting.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   Now, of course, they have the accounting reports.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.800]   Here we come to tax time.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.200]   Sales tax, summary, profit, and loss, all the stuff your accountant wants they can do.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.800]   But that's kind of behind the scenes.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.400]   It's done automatically.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.360]   And just you just do what you would normally do.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.360]   You invoice people.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.200]   By the way, it's a lot easier to invoice people than it used to be.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.640]   I used to fire up Microsoft Word and excel and then I have to--
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.880]   The invoicing is the best piece.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.200]   Oh, well, that's how they started, right?
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   That's how I started using it.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   You have invoicing is so good.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   Twelve years ago I started using it.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.000]   You don't need to install software either.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Like the other one.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   No, it's all on the web.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   It's all on the cloud.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.200]   You might want the app.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.000]   The app will let you take pictures of receipts and import them right in there.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.920]   Oh, I'm a desktop like with the CD-ROMs or the other.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.920]   I know.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.920]   Crazy.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:29.920]   Crazy.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   You have to keep installing them.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.600]   Did you know that invoicing clients online, the kind of invoices you do at FreshBooks
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.200]   will get you paid an average of 11 days faster?
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   Of course.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   That's 'cause.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.200]   It's easy for the clients to pay.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.800]   There's even a 'pay me' button right on there.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.040]   You can see what invoices have been sent, what viewed.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040]   Yes, viewed.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.960]   You can tell if they've read the invoice you'll know immediately.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.200]   So when they try that--
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.840]   I didn't get your invoice.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.200]   Now you can say, no, no, you read it.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.760]   I saw it.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.960]   And of course, when you've been paid as well as over a day with outstanding invoices, it's
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.880]   easy to brand the invoices set, recurring invoices set, auto payment reminders.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.480]   There's even automatic late fees.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.120]   It's just the easiest way to keep track business.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.120]   Time tracking too.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.920]   If you have one of those businesses where an attorney is charging by the hour or a designer
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.840]   or a writer, it's very cool.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.960]   You can pause and hit play.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.400]   You can assign it.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.520]   You can track it by vendor, by category, by project.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.520]   Same thing with expenses.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:30.640]   I can go on and on, but look, we got a 30-day unrestricted free trial for you at freshbooks.com/twitfreshbooks.com/twit.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.000]   When it says, "How did you hear about us?"
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.360]   Just use this week in tech.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.520]   And that way they'll know you so.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.520]   Uncle Leo.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.520]   Support in the show.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.520]   What?
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.520]   Uncle Leo.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.520]   Uncle Leo.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.520]   Tell them Uncle Leo sent you.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   They used to-- remember that?
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.520]   It was fun the old days.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.520]   Tell them you're Uncle Leo.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.000]   I always-- you know, I never did that though.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.960]   I used to-- I would do radio ads and stuff and say, "Tell him Leo sent you."
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.720]   And then I-- but I remember like I'd go to the mattress place.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.840]   I never say, "Who's going to say, 'Hey, oh, by the way, before you write up that bill?'"
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.840]   Uncle Leo sent me.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.840]   Who's going to say that?
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.840]   No one's going to say that.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   It's creepy.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.840]   You're going to say, "I heard it on the radio," or something.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.840]   You're not going to say, "Uncle Leo sent me."
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.840]   It would be more like Uncle Leo sent me?
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.840]   He sent me.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.840]   He sent me.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.840]   Does that mean-- do I get anything for that?
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840]   I'm a friend of Leo's.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.840]   Leo?
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   Does it mean Leo?
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   Right about?
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.840]   That sounds like another one of those anonymous--
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.840]   Do you know-- it's like when you go to the club and you go to the bounce, you know what I'm
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.840]   saying, Patrick, when you go to the club?
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.840]   And the bounce, you're like, "I know Steve."
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:24.840]   I just don't know.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:31.840]   Steve, I know big Steve.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.840]   First I know big Steve.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.840]   Always say I know big Steve.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   That's a good one.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.840]   You can't lose.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.840]   Steve.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.840]   Actually, related to big Steve.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.840]   Hey.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:45.840]   Apple engineer says, "Tim Cook is more rigid, less competitive than Steve Jobs was."
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.840]   No, I don't know.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.840]   Can you trust these former Apple engineer-- at least he's doing it by name on CNBC.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.840]   Bob Burrow, he said, "In 2007, four years before Steve's death, Apple was organizationally
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   the Wild West."
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.840]   But this is in response-- this is kind of a follow up to his tweets saying that Jobs,
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   era company, was thin, competitive and dynamic.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.840]   He says under Tim Cook, "Mmm."
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.840]   "Rigid, not competitive."
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.840]   Tony Fidell denied it.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.840]   He said, "Wrong!"
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.840]   [Laughs]
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   "Wrong!"
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.840]   There was--
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.840]   You're not a new MacBook Pro.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.840]   Is it pointless?
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.840]   Actually, first book, something else to look at.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.840]   I have to say, there's only one product Apple's come out with in the last year that I think
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.840]   is worth talking about.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.840]   Maybe the iPhone 7, but the AirPods are probably the only thing that is really a classic Apple
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:32.840]   product, where it's kind of a beautiful design, highly functional--
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.840]   Overpriced.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.840]   Overpriced.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   Easy to lose.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   But I think it is design-wise, very impressive.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.840]   Apple 7's pretty good.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.840]   I mean, it looks great, but it's the implementation of it.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:52.840]   Apple has always built good-looking products with very few exceptions.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.840]   But at the moment, they're just treading water, and they seem to have been for the last couple of years.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.840]   And I don't get why they've stalled quite as bad as they had.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:02.840]   It's hard.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.840]   When you have a product like the iPhone, it's so--
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:05.840]   Losing Steve Jobs.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.840]   Like, like, so successful.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.840]   Losing Steve Jobs, somebody who just drives people and inspires people.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.840]   It's a real loss.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:19.840]   Tim is a wonderful guy, but do you think he inspires people to do their best?
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   No, obviously he would admit that he does not inspire people to the way Steve Jobs does.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.840]   So they're just going through this dark era.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.840]   And at some point, you know, Tim's going to have to find somebody who can then come out
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.840]   with this next level of products that is inspiring.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.840]   They're not inspiring people, and in fact, they're frustrating people.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:41.840]   I just take issue with someone saying that, "Oh, it was the Wild West, and it was so much better back then."
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.840]   That's nostalgic.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.840]   And it's one of the things.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.840]   Actually, I'd say this is even more important than the design cues, because there's a lot
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   of companies out there making beautiful stuff.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.840]   But Apple built this juggernaut, this behind the scenes juggernaut of a supply chain.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.840]   And it--
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.840]   Under Tim Cook.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.840]   --and destroyed everybody.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.840]   Yeah, because when it was the combination, you had to have a product to sell.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.840]   So if Tim Cook was given, you know, a bunch of new--
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.840]   You could make zoos as well as pros and cons.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.840]   --of zoons, right?
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.840]   It's not going to help.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:14.840]   You know, what Tim's done well, and he deserves credit for, is he has massively rang the cash register.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.840]   Yes.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.840]   The level of efficiency, the amount of cash they have, it's all flawless, in which you would
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   expect.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.840]   But at some point, they're going to need somebody in there who can actually be the arbiter of
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.840]   beauty and design and take risk.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.840]   They have no iPhone-like product in the pipeline that anybody knows about.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.840]   The only possibilities is AR glasses, but, you know, the MacBook is a disaster.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.840]   The watches are a disaster.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.840]   I think that's their next attempt.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.840]   I mean, that's got to be the next attempt, is the AR glasses.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.840]   The other possibility is with Johnny A. I have there--
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:49.840]   Is Johnny there?
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.840]   No, he's not.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   He's not.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.840]   Johnny, I was checking.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:53.840]   Johnny, I was checking.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.840]   Johnny, I was checking.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.840]   I think, I think, got this possibility of creating a Netflix-like service.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:03.840]   And what I've been pushing them to do is to create their own version of Prime, which is put
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.840]   iCloud with music--
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   Yes.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.840]   --with some sort of video rental and with AppleCare.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   Although I have to say, would you have said the same thing before Bezos was so successful
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.840]   with Prime?
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.840]   Because on the surface, Prime looks like this hodgepodge of unrelated services.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.840]   Here's the thing.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.840]   Like, here's my basket of crap.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   Give me 99 bucks.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:24.840]   It doesn't--
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.840]   Before it happened, I would have said--
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   That's actually two days.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   That's not a bad name.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.840]   Three, two days delivery was compelling for a large number of people.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.840]   Two days was all--
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.840]   Gdiel becomes icing.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.840]   Music becomes icing.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   It's all icing.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.840]   There's this rich cake.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:35.840]   Apple has now has iCloud.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.120]   They figured out.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.120]   And they launched music.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.040]   I never was an AppleCare guy.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.960]   But I would-- yeah, if you throw an AppleCare maybe.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.760]   But music is intriguing, but not--
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:49.000]   Well, that's why it's interesting that these rumors about Apple becoming a Netflix competitor
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.960]   are all under Apple Music.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   Yes.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.960]   It's not a separate iTunes--
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.520]   Which don't rename it something.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   It'll just be Apple Entertain.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.520]   Apple Media, Apple Entertainment, or something.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.520]   Exactly.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.520]   And for them to-- we have to look at it.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.040]   Netflix is going to spend $6 billion this year.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.040]   And that's to $500 million from HBO.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.040]   HBO says--
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.080]   Who's the genius in Netflix though that chooses shows?
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.080]   Because--
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.080]   A lot of people--
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.080]   That's the key, isn't it?
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.080]   Well, if you don't think about a lot of the house of cards--
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.640]   Well, actually, a lot of that was data mined because they found out that people that liked
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:23.120]   Kevin Spacey also liked films done by the director of House of Cards.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.120]   And they liked political dramas.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.600]   They thought, right, OK, well, we'll do a political drama with Kevin Spacey and directed
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   by this guy.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   It didn't work that way though.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.520]   But what happened was Dana Brunetti and Kevin Spacey, Trigger Street, put together House
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.520]   of Cards, shopped it.
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:38.680]   And I think it was-- had a good offer from a cable network, probably HBO.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.680]   OK.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.000]   And Brunetti told me this.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.160]   On the night before they made the deal with HBO-- he never did tell me who the cable company
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.040]   was, but I have to presume.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.360]   He got a call from Netflix who said, hold on.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.160]   We'd like to offer you $100 million.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.480]   And they said that a few things that Brunetti liked and Spacey liked, one of which is you
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.080]   can launch the whole season at once.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.080]   Right.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.400]   And for some reason, they really liked that.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   They loved that binge thing.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.400]   It's a game changer.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.240]   Well, but I don't understand because it seems to me that's a negative because look at the
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.560]   shows that come out once a week like Game of Thrones, which is coming back in three months.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:16.400]   You get this whole week of blog posts and newspaper articles and magazines--
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.400]   Consumers.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   HBO is going to blink.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.400]   And buzz.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   HBO is going to blink.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.600]   Because consumers like-- I know consumers like binge watching.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.600]   You have under a million subs to HBO go.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:32.320]   I mean, I know people subscribe by the way, but how is HBO falling behind Netflix in terms
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.320]   of total subs?
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.320]   That's crazy.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.320]   It's because of this exact issue.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.120]   HBO is going to blink.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.560]   Well, Brunetti apparently knew that because he said that was the thing.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.280]   And he called Kevin and said, Kevin, I know we got a deal here, but wait a minute, would
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.080]   you consider Netflix?
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   And they made the deal and they're obviously very happy season four or five.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.440]   I think it's coming five.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:58.360]   And that was a template that Netflix used to create stranger things.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.200]   And I mean, so many great oranges and new--
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   I understand these.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.160]   But we were talking earlier about things that the younger generation will not understand.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.040]   And I think in 10 years' time, if you try to explain to a 10-year-old that back in the
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.280]   day we had to wait for a week to find out what was going to happen on our favorite TV
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.880]   shows, they'll look at you like, you're mad.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.920]   I mean, binge watching is where it's going.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:27.080]   And I think the creators like it better because the story is more intact, right?
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.880]   You don't have to do a whole lot of exposition saying, now you may remember last week, all
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.120]   of this happened.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:37.960]   It's a little easier as a storyteller to think of it as a six-hour movie or a 10-hour or
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.520]   13-hour movie than as a weekly one after the other.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:47.080]   The fun thing about that is that kind of content leads us more to a content style that
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.720]   we have down south with novellas.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.800]   That's the whole idea of an encapsulated story.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   I have a story to tell.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.200]   When you say "Dazz-Z" you mean the Philippines?
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   Well, no.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.200]   Yeah, the Philippines too.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   But more Mexico, south-south America.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   Oh, yeah, the telenovela.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   Telenovela.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.600]   I've got a story.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.280]   It will take three seasons.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   Right.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.280]   And then it will be done.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.280]   And it's a package and it's ready to sell.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:09.680]   Well, creators also love the idea they're not tied to a TV series for an indeterminate
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.680]   amount of time.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.680]   Here's the main problem.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:17.040]   When you're NBC and CBS and ABC, and I've had to deal with this, of late, you have
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.600]   to wait for a show to come off air for your show to get slotted in.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.000]   You're in a holding pattern.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   Right.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.520]   If Netflix wants to put out five Game of Thrones or two more, you know, whatever, House of
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.280]   Cards, they don't have to wait for anybody to put it out.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.720]   And they don't have to appease the lowest common denominator.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.680]   They can put out a show they know appeals to women, to men.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.160]   They don't need to get 100 million viewers.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.160]   They can be able to be with 8 million.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.280]   They make this work, which means the artists are happier.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.280]   Right.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   And so.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.000]   You also don't get filler episodes because it's not, well, we've got four seasons.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   We've got this many hours.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.640]   We have to fill this time.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.240]   It's like, no, tell your story.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.240]   Move on.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   There is a potential negative to that, which is a content overload.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:59.200]   And both Amazon and Netflix are getting the point where the originals, there's so many,
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.760]   I don't even know what to watch.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   Right.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.760]   Here's the thing.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.160]   You have Netflix is making over $2 billion a quarter.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.520]   They're spending $6 billion on content.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.200]   They should just make a genius to say that 70% of their money is going to content, which
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   is extraordinary.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.000]   But then you have to think about the fact that they're going to own that content forever.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   Well, not always.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.320]   How some cards is first run only.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.200]   And then it goes back to the trigger street.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.800]   But it's not always the case.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.720]   They're going to own most of the stuff they're going to own.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.880]   There's very few cases where they're going to have this kind of relationship.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.880]   They'll own it for the only for the change.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.640]   I get the face of the classical special deal.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.640]   It was the first.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:35.080]   So there was, it's also something that was making a virtue out of necessity because Netflix
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:39.280]   was having trouble just as Apple is making deals with Hollywood to get these shows on
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.280]   streaming.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:44.000]   Hollywood said, you only have the DVD, but you're not putting our first run movie on streaming
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.800]   and they were getting more and more crap.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.240]   Now nobody cares what's on Netflix.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   It's a bonus.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   Right.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240]   And they're getting so aggressive.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:54.160]   I don't know if you saw this story, but Amazon offered all films at Sundance.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.160]   If you got accepted to Sundance, they gave you a hundred thousand dollar offer for the
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.160]   streaming rights.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.160]   Chicken feet.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.160]   Who's the freer?
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.160]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.160]   Chicken feet.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.000]   It is chicken feet for the top third of movies at Sundance.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.040]   The bottom half of movies at Sundance don't get paid.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.200]   They literally do not get sold or they get sold for 25k.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.520]   So it's a massive payday.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.400]   So this is just like coming in and being like, you know what?
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:19.720]   We'll take everything and showing a massive amount of support for new directors and they'll
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.720]   pick up, I think a dozen or two dozen films this way.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:27.760]   And they have acquired the acquired film at Sundance yesterday.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.600]   We have Manchester by the Sea was a Sundance.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.440]   We have a model for that by Amazon.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.000]   The Blumhouse films.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.760]   So he broke Hollywood.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.200]   He's the guy who said, look, I'm not spending a hundred million dollars on a film.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.600]   I'm going to spend a million dollars on a hundred films.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.480]   99 of them are going to crap out.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.760]   One of them is going to be the next paranormal activity.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.760]   Right.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.040]   And that's the model.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.040]   Do that.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.240]   Just get your net out and you're going to own a lot of really bad content.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.720]   But that one series that takes off, it's going to be a cash cow for the next 10 years.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.560]   And there's a lot of insiders who are saying this is not the way to make content.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.880]   But I mean, it's what we want.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.760]   We want to be able to choose what we want to watch.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.800]   So back to Apple, do you think that this model works for a company like Apple?
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.400]   I think Apple could put an Amazon Prime like package together that they lost money on
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.600]   because they make such a high margin on services.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:21.280]   So if you buy an iPhone or an iPad, it could come with the first year of Apple music,
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.880]   or Apple Entertainment, let's call it, or Apple Now, whatever we're going to call Apple
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.880]   Entertainment.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:30.200]   If Apple Entertainment came for a year with any device, I mean, what an amazing offering
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.360]   that would be if they wound up hitting their own Game of Thrones or their own house of
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.840]   cards, you'd be like, oh, when I get the device, I can watch these TV shows.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.840]   This is rad.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:42.360]   So just think of the NFL's done this with Verizon for a while, exclusive streaming of NFL games.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.360]   So no, it's a no brainer.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:47.720]   It's that popular with, I don't know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not sure.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:52.760]   I think it's out of Apple's traditional skillset when they never usually do well in that.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.440]   But that's why I was asking, who is the brain at Netflix who pick, because Netflix picks
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.440]   content well.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.160]   Amazon doesn't mean Amazon does it a little differently.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.680]   They have kind of a, they have wrong Jeremy.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.720]   No, no, I said they're all, he said differently.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.720]   Oh, right.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:12.200]   They're all hiring up all the executives from HBO and everything else.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.200]   Okay.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.200]   That's what you do.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.200]   These people know how to make content about it.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   They all have massive footprint.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.000]   Amazon does it with data, right?
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.560]   Cause they just have pilot week and they show.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:21.760]   Apple has a problem though.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:26.000]   They have a problem in that they are much like Microsoft at the early 2000s.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   They've got the golden calf right now.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.680]   iPhone, it's the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.680]   It's the only division that's really cool.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:31.680]   Yeah, but it's shrinking.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.480]   It is not going to continue to get.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.920]   But it's still making a lot of money.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:40.200]   And so how do you convince the people of the company and your investors that we need
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.800]   to kill that because this market is growing.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.200]   They're not going to kill it.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.200]   They're just, think about this.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   They, you know, this is a company making 200 billion a year.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:50.320]   They can just fund this out of money.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.760]   They're making $25 billion right now on services.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   Right.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:57.480]   So if they're making 25 billion on services, they can F around and put $5 billion towards
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.560]   this and be spending just as much as Netflix and then just add it to the service package.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.560]   They don't need to make money off.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.560]   They make back half their money.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   They'd be happy.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.720]   When do we get a scarcity of good stuff though?
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.120]   When does it happen that there's so many people bidding in this market?
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.640]   We're already starting to happen that many cities where I have some friends in the TV
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.840]   and film business.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:18.000]   Many of the cities where people actually film like Toronto and Vancouver and all those
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.440]   places, they're just getting maxed out.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.680]   So that's one problem.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.400]   The other problem is also a limited number of great writers and show writers.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.840]   That's what's happening is the writers you nailed it.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.000]   It's the right, they're running out of great writers.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.120]   So the writers are just like cashing in now like, what can I write?
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.120]   What can I write?
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   Good job.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.120]   I should practice.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:39.080]   I have a Jesuit brother in Los Angeles who is currently on spec for five different scripts.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.400]   They didn't need to give them a detailed treatment.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.200]   They said, yeah, we like your stuff.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.920]   We're going to give you an advance and we need you to write this.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:45.920]   We need done in six months.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.920]   It's interesting.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   It's never happened before.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.920]   Apple's suing Qualcomm for a billion dollars.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:53.240]   They say Qualcomm has been charging royalties for technologies.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.520]   They have nothing to do with royalties.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:59.040]   Apple's paying those royalties.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:04.280]   And I think the real reason they're a little pissed off that Qualcomm supported Samsung
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:08.600]   and its lawsuit against Apple and this it's time for payback.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:12.280]   Well, Qualcomm rules from the easy target.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.200]   What was the Korean investigation and a whole bunch of other stuff?
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.920]   Apple says for many years, Qualcomm is unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technology.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:23.120]   They have nothing to do with the more Apple innovates with unique features like touch
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:29.360]   ID, advanced plays, cameras just to name a few the more money Qualcomm collects for no
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.360]   reasons.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.360]   Well, that's how royalties work.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.000]   The more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations, Qualcomm builds its
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.920]   business on older legacy standards, but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.520]   and excessive royalties.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:47.880]   Isn't this just tempting karma, punching karma in the face?
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.800]   It's surprising because tech companies do now.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:57.280]   I thought Steve Jobs was the guy who did this kind of thing and that Tim was a little bit
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   above the fray.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.120]   Come on, lawyers need pourshes too.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.880]   No, they need Teslas.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.040]   Well, yes, true.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:12.320]   But I mean, it's deeply disturbing, but tech firms now spend too much time litigating
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:16.040]   this kind of rubbish when they should be concentrating on innovating.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:19.720]   Frankly, you could make the same charges against pretty much any tech company if you
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:20.880]   dug deep enough.
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:26.080]   It seems to me another kind of nail in Apple's coffin that when a company's struggling,
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.080]   what do they do?
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.120]   Well, they start suing other companies for a billion dollars.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:33.880]   I'd like to see Samsung actually take the text from Apple's complaint and use it against
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.880]   Apple's companies.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:41.280]   Speaking of Samsung, tomorrow we will know what happened to the Note 7, the result of Samsung's
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.280]   investigation will be revealed.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.480]   Wall Street Journal says it knows already.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.720]   Yeah, the rumor is that Wall Street Journal basically got the exclusive, so they'll play
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.360]   nice with Samsung next time rounds.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:54.000]   Because right now they play nice with Apple mostly.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   That's not nice.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   Don't do that.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.200]   Anyway, the story, maybe they did have a leak, is that the batteries in the iPhone, I'm
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.840]   sorry, the Note 7 were irregularly sized.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:13.960]   And so some of the note, this is why not all, but some of the Note 7's got, became explosive
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.880]   because the batteries were, I guess, too big.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.200]   And getting compacted down and that was causing break.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.200]   I don't know.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.640]   I mean, were those the battery packs that were made in the United States?
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   Is that going to be the...
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.640]   That could be very interesting if so.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.640]   That's not great.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.640]   I mean, it's...
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   But I mean, we've heard so many different explanations.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.760]   They're trying to pack too much technology in there.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.760]   They did it too narrow.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.760]   They did it too narrow.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.760]   It was the software.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.760]   It's just...
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.000]   This is what they're going to tell us the problem was.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.040]   The big thing is, can they actually make it right next time round?
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.040]   They have to.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.840]   They've got the S8 coming right.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.360]   And just like the Antennagate with iPhone 4.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.760]   Was that iPhone 4 had the Antennagate in it?
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.000]   It's like these things pass.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.640]   Nobody got killed.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.760]   And cost the company $5 billion.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.520]   Which is nothing for a company that makes $300.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.520]   But more importantly...
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.520]   They'll easily get through it.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.680]   Some people might get fired, but I think there's no way that they'll have this problem occur
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.680]   in the 8.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.840]   No, I don't think you can afford to, but it was really unfortunate for Samsung that
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.560]   at a time when they could have just nailed iPhone 8.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.560]   It was considered...
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.000]   It was the first time it was considered universally a better phone than the iPhone 7.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   Correct?
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.480]   And they had a chance to absolutely pummel Apple and they just screwed the pooch.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   That's a gift to Apple.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.360]   When you think about it, let's say they had nailed that and they didn't have the problem.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.520]   What would that have done to Apple?
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.520]   Would Apple have lost...
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.960]   It is a phenomenal product.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.680]   I got my hand taken up.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.680]   It was amazing.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.600]   It's like, okay, this is the Jesus phone.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.000]   Would it have been good enough to un-throw...
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.640]   Oh gosh, it's thrown at Apple.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.200]   Better battery life, better screen, faster processors, more flexible.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.600]   You have to swing voters.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.480]   We saw on the election, who are these 5% of people who can't decide between a...
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.480]   Yeah.
