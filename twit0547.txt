[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.040]   And we are going to have a wild ride as Betty Davis once said.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.160]   Fasten your seat belts, we're in for a bumpy night starting with all the way to my right.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.360]   Christina Warren from Mashable.com.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   Hey Christina.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.360]   Hey Leo.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.400]   So nice to see you in the Mashable offices.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   You work a lot.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.240]   I do work a lot.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.520]   My apartment, we've got some stuff happening in it right now.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   So I was like, you know what?
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   I'm just going to go to the office.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   They'll be better.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.000]   That's how it always is in New York City.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   There's always stuff happening.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   There's always stuff happening.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   There's always stuff happening.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   There's always stuff happening.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Great to have you.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.840]   Also with us, Alex Wilhelm of Easy Editor in Chief now at Mind Over Matter.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   Cool enough.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   Matter Mark, but I'll take that.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840]   So fun.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.840]   Okay.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   Matter Mark writing as an analyst now.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.920]   A journalist, analyst kind of a fusion of the two rules.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.320]   It's an interesting thing because we always talk about analysts and their audience of
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.240]   course is the investor.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.160]   So they talk and you're here for a reason this week because this is the quarterly result
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.080]   week of bar none.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.440]   But they talk about stuff in terms of is it a good investment as opposed to what say
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.560]   I would as a tech journalist, is it something you would want to own?
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.920]   So it's a different business, but you're conflating the two.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.000]   I don't really think I learned either camp given that dichotomy you set up.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.240]   More I'm just looking at market trends, venture capital trends, startup trends, that sort of
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   thing.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.680]   So it's not really investment advice or what you should buy.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.400]   It's kind of in the how it's actually made.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.480]   But your audience is people who are.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.840]   My audience is people like Jason.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.320]   Yes, but not entirely.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.720]   But it's been fun so far.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   It's been about a month now.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.520]   So I've had a good shot.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.240]   Ultimately, if I say this phone is not a good phone to buy that affects investors, but
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   it's just a different.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.920]   I'm talking to people, end users kind of premise.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.760]   Absolutely.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.000]   And as he talks only to God, ladies and gentlemen, he's also here.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   God's dead.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Oh my God.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   He's breaking to you all, but God died a lot.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   He's out.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.800]   He's the nichey of the venture capital world creator.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.120]   Many moons ago, the Silicon Valley reporter.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.680]   That was my first thing in journalism.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.120]   And then later, of course, you started in gadget.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.840]   Yeah, auto blog, joystick, bunch of blogs, web blogs, Inc sold it to AOL.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.040]   18 months after starting.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   To Los Angeles.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   He's still proud.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.240]   You're an angel investor now, yes?
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.400]   Yeah, angel investing, yeah.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   And runs the launch conference.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   It's a great one.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   Launch festival coming up March 2nd.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.160]   They're in 4th, 15,000 people coming.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.240]   And is I think one of the great voices, more so even than something like Mark Cuban for
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.800]   users in technology.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.560]   I think you often speak truth to power where it is risky for many people to do so.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.840]   You don't care.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.440]   I have never cared.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.280]   I remain not caring.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   Well, this is a good thing.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.760]   I mean, when you, whenever it gets you there, my theory is keep doing that, which is probably
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   a mistake.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.760]   Right.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   But I think that that's the right thing.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   You're the Brooklyn kid.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.760]   You don't need it.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.760]   I like being the answer.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.760]   I don't care.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.760]   I don't have to.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   I like being the answer.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.760]   Alex doesn't care for reasons.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   Mainly, might have to do with alcoholism.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   But reasons we don't understand.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760]   And Christina and I, we can't speak.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   Hey, mom.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   How's it going?
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   Glad you watched the show today.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   I appreciate that.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   No, no, no, no.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   I don't want to insult your mom.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   Wow.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   Okay.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760]   Who should we start with?
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   We have Apple.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   We have Facebook.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.400]   Well, Apple and Facebook are two.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.560]   Who else announced quarters off?
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.840]   Microsoft is third.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.960]   So all right, I'll let the open to voting.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   What should we start with?
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.000]   I don't have an Apple person.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Apple is.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.640]   Apple had the most successful quarter in American financial history in terms of profit, right?
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.360]   18 and a half billion dollars in profit.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.640]   That's six billion a month.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.560]   Yeah, their profit was a Tesla or like two Twitters almost.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   Amazing.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.560]   And a quarter.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   On a quarter.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   In three months.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.560]   Three months.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   Incredible revenue.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.360]   However, stocks down.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.360]   This is down.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   Down.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.280]   Because Apple gave some interesting guidance, they in effect said, well, it's been fun, but
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.080]   we can't grow at this rate anymore.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.880]   Now, I have to say, we looked at the price to earnings.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.040]   Now, I'm not a financial guy.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.560]   So you guys who know this with this.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.480]   But I looked at the price, Apple is a fairly reasonable six or seven bucks compared to
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.280]   Amazon, which is 800 bucks.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.280]   Yep.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.760]   So Apple's price of its stock is fairly low compared to how much money it makes, which
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.920]   implies investors are pricing in lower growth moving forward.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   That's why Amazon's.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   That's what that means.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.920]   Yes.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   Because Amazon only has upside.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   Amazon has the profit either.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.920]   It's all over for us.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.640]   And you also have to discount all that cash.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   So that's like a little bit of a million.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.640]   Two hundred billion plus in.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.120]   So if you take that off the top, then you do the price earning ratio on the remaining
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.120]   value of the company.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.120]   What do you mean?
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.600]   But they have 50 or 60 billion dollars in long term debt.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.280]   So like the cash number is great, but not quite as strong as you would think.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.080]   Why don't they just pay off the debt?
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.220]   Because they're borrowing locally to pay dividends and share back to the US and the cash
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.220]   and mostly foreign.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.220]   So they can't repatriate it.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.220]   Tax cost.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.220]   They can.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.220]   They just have to pay tax like a warehouse.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.220]   Well, they don't want to pay tax.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.220]   They don't want to pay for it.
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.220]   They don't want to pay for it.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.220]   They don't want to pay for it.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.220]   They don't want to pay for it.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.220]   They don't want to pay for it.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.220]   They don't want to pay for it.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.220]   They don't want to pay for it.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.220]   They don't want to pay for it.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:11.220]   They can take the debt and they've got plenty of cash on hand.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.220]   Why not?
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.220]   Apples.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.220]   Okay.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.220]   There's two percentages that are interesting.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.220]   Apples profit margin is 40%.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.220]   Since yeah.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.220]   Not bad.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.220]   Not bad.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.220]   It's very interesting.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.220]   Android makes nothing on hardware.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.220]   I mean, only Tiffany has a better profit margin than Apple.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.220]   And maybe not even Tiffany.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.220]   It's probably doesn't have a better profit.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.220]   Maybe Van Gogh perhaps a Picasso.
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.220]   But probably not.
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.220]   They're probably not.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.220]   They're probably not.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.220]   You know, it's 40%.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.220]   Now Apple's advisory is as well.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.740]   So Apple's advisory is that's going down back down to like 35% old shocking.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.220]   But the other number that I find shocking is 25% tax rate.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.420]   Now I don't know about you, but I pay about 40, 45% because I'm in a high tax state.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.580]   Apple also in a high tax state has managed to kind of skirt.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.220]   But Google does the same everybody does that, right?
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.220]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.340]   I mean, there's definitely tax reforms that are going to occur if like we get someone like
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.180]   Bernie Sanders in and then they'll be things rolled back.
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.180]   Or it will get easier for people.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.180]   I mean, capital gains tax is the big, you know, sort of unfair advantage in America.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.180]   People who are investors long term pay less than people who work for a living.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.180]   Kind of maybe it should just be the same.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.180]   It's the Warren Buffett secretary argument essentially.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.180]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.180]   I agree with you on that.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.180]   I think it's very important.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.180]   But I think that Warren Buffett said his secretary pays more taxes than he does.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.180]   It's a high percentage of his or not.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.180]   And he begged to pay more taxes.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.180]   Warren Buffett's not going to have it.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.180]   For some reason, Congress ignored Warren's begging.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.180]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.180]   I mean, he's giving it all the way anyway.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.180]   So it's kind of.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.180]   I'm giving it all the way.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.180]   Are you going to give it all the way?
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.180]   I'm giving it all the way.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.180]   I'm giving it all the way.
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.180]   Right.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.180]   But that's really not the story.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.180]   The story is Apple said, we don't expect more than 1% growth in iPhone sales.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.180]   iPhone sales have powered Apple's great success over the last eight years.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.180]   I mean, it's the most phenomenal product ever in terms of sales and profits.
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.480]   I mean, it's printed money.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.620]   But if you think about the upgrade cycle, you know, we've been saying this for a long
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.980]   time when a product gets to version 678, whether it's a flat panel TV or a laptop, like
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.540]   how much is left that will drive somebody to buy the next version.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.940]   And I think what you're seeing is a lot of people will skip a version now.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.820]   You probably know some people in the audience who still have iPhone 5S's and they don't
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.900]   care that it's not a 6S or a 6.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.860]   And then I know people who have a 4 who are like, yeah, I'll upgrade to the 6 or I'll
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.740]   have the 5, I'll wait for the 7.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.380]   So that like, I think the quick upgrade cycle is going to come to an M because does anybody
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.580]   care about like force touch?
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.580]   Does anybody care about live photos?
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.980]   Like no, it seems like the things that they're adding are not they're tangential to the core
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.980]   experience.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.620]   People are not seeing a recent upgrade just like you might not upgrade your flat panel
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.140]   for 3D or to go to 4K.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.460]   You know, like do I need 4K to watch a television show that's not shot in 4K?
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.460]   No.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.860]   So the upgrade cycle is really busted.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.940]   Are they also running out of humans?
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.940]   No.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.140]   They still have a small market share.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.980]   Because they still have India, Brazil, Russia, they haven't really been tested.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.980]   Some of the growth this year was China.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.180]   Well, most of it was China and you know, China's economy is slowing.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.180]   So that's one part of it.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.180]   They're not going to see the growth there.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.580]   And China's own, you know, phone cells from some of their own, you know, phone makers
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.100]   like Xiaomi haven't met expectations either.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.980]   And Apple, they're basically flat, but they didn't decrease.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.540]   But I think that they still definitely have growth opportunities.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.780]   The problem is do they have growth opportunities at the prices and the margins they want to
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.780]   sell them at?
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.700]   That's a, that's a much, it's a separate conversation.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.380]   They still have places they could sell them, but not necessarily the prices and the margins.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.380]   They want to sell them at.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.380]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.380]   I'm curious.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.420]   Because in brick countries will lower ASPs for smartphones in the next couple of years.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.580]   Yeah, I think it has to.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.580]   I think it has to.
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.580]   Okay.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.580]   That's brick.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.580]   Brazil, Russia, India, China.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.780]   So I'm looking at a great graph.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:42.500]   Jason Stellat, six colors put together of quarterly iPhone sales from 2011 through 2016.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.460]   And the last, this, of course, is spiky because the new iPhone comes out.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.460]   That's the jump.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.460]   This thing was a huge spike.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.460]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.460]   And it's growing, growing, growing.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.460]   And the six which came out in 2015, 74 and a half million in that quarter.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.980]   Well, that was a couple things.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.700]   That was the first time that they were launching China mobile.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.700]   Right.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.260]   Well, they were already in China, but they were on China mobile at launch.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.260]   So that was the first big thing.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.780]   And then the second thing was they had the two sizes.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.020]   They had the, you know, the six and the six plus.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.100]   And I think that you're right, Jason, when you say that people aren't necessarily upgrading
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:14.380]   Ford Force touch or, you know, for, or 3D text, whatever, or live photos, but I do think
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.900]   people were upgrading for the bigger screen size.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.300]   Can I just point out something here?
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.180]   I mean, if you look at the two year cycle, so we'll go back to 2013, 14, which was the
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.180]   iPhone 5.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.220]   It wasn't huge growth because it was a talk.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.820]   But the tick cycle to the six was a big jump.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.980]   Now we're going again with a talk.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.300]   Is there any reason to think there won't be a giant jump a year from now when the iPhone
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.300]   7 comes out?
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.100]   You say it's not enough, but I think people upgrade.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.100]   It depends on what they do.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.100]   I think it depends on what they do.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.780]   I think they could, if they could really come out with a compelling product, a compelling
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.940]   design, you could certainly get that.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.940]   I don't know.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.900]   And doesn't Apple wanted to foster this by doing their own financing?
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.780]   I mean, if you take advantage of the Apple financing, you have an automatic upgrade.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.780]   That's the talent.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.780]   Long until they're a carrier, it's my question.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.740]   But that's the tell because that's the giveaway.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.020]   I can tell you what the tell is.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.060]   When, remember, they were like, "Oh, we're going to just have one phone, one size.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.060]   That's it.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.060]   We're going to make something perfect."
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.860]   And they're like, "Yeah, but we're going to have the C-thing and we're going to have
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.860]   the plus."
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.260]   And then on iPad, we have the mini and now we got the big one.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.980]   Well, it's just we need to find growth somewhere.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.740]   So if executives are going to buy the iPad Pro because they want to have a sexy new
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.740]   device or people who are Android, people will say, "Oh, maybe I can afford this new smaller
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.660]   iPhone," or people who would have bought the Fablet and bought the next Samsung Note,
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.500]   say, "Oh, I'll go back to the iPhone operating system."
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.500]   The graph?
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.500]   The plus.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.820]   Yeah, the graph for iPad sales is even more dramatic.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.140]   You see the peak was in 2014, and it just continues to tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.100]   Well, that's another one where like, "Why do you need to upgrade?"
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.740]   Like, "I have iPad 2s around the house."
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.540]   Why do you use the Pro?
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.540]   Whatever they make, I buy.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.540]   I mean, that's just...
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.540]   You're working.
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.540]   I buy every...
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.540]   No, that's not a joke.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.540]   It's literally by every single product they make.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.540]   Seriously, every single one.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.540]   Literally, every one.
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.140]   Did you buy the Apple Watch series edition?
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.140]   No, he didn't buy that.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.140]   No, not that.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.140]   I was going to preach your mind.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.140]   No, Apple Watch.
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.140]   You were right.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.140]   No, I'm wearing my Fitbit Pro.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.140]   You're wearing the President's Watch.
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.140]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.140]   I'm a nerd.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.140]   But I know, I just literally buy each one.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.140]   I test it.
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.740]   I play with it, and then I just give it to somebody in my organization or family.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:21.420]   But I think when you start coming out with the battery case, you're looking for growth
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.420]   somewhere.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.420]   Like, no more Mofie cases.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.980]   We're going to make our own battery case.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.140]   And that goes into that profitability.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.500]   That's short-term.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.220]   But they're also doing things for long-term growth project, Titan, which is an autonomous
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.220]   car project.
