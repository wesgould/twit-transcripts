[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   >> I should make it out here.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   >> I'm really glad you could be here.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   >> Let's go.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   >> Do you like it?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   You got some tea?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   >> Got the tea going.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Got the laptop, Wi-Fi, I'm pretty much set.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   >> We could put a table there if you want.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   >> No, you did.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   >> You got the table.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   David Prager doesn't.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   >> Do you go anywhere without Prager?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Is he your bodyguard?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   >> Kevin's an driver.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   >> I saw a tweet.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Tell me if this is true that you had a bodyguard in Austin.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   >> There was security in Austin.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   >> But it wasn't like a bodyguard.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   >> But it was crazy at that dignity.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   >> I mean, there was like, how many people came like 2,500 or something like that?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   >> Wow.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   >> Yeah, the venue capacity is 2,000 and then I think they crammed a couple more hundred
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   in.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   >> Wow.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   >> It was, I mean, every time we've done anything like that, it's outrageously flattering.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I mean, it's all because of Kevin there.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   He's a star.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   >> It's just, well, I mean, people get crushed if you don't have security saying like, hey,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   get back.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   >> No, you have to do that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   >> But if you do a search on Flickr for, like, South by Southwest Ignatian, you'll see you can
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   find piles of photos.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I think Dick has a photo pool.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   >> Yeah, we did.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   >> Cool.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   >> But that's not all, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   No, the star power continues.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Mr. Jason Calicanis is also here.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   >> Hello, hello.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> Best known for poker.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   >> Yes, lost 1200 last night.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.920]   >> Did you make your own game?
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.680]   >> Did you serve in your own game?
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.680]   That's not right.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   >> It's terrible.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.800]   >> You know, the worst thing is when you tap out at your own game and you have to like
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.520]   serve sandwiches, that's really awesome.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.240]   >> Yeah, it was, it was, it was not fun.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> Did you, you were in the celebrity poker for the World Poker Tour.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   How'd that go?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Did you, how long did you have?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> I did really good.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.600]   I came in 90th out of 420 people or something, 410 people.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   >> Does that mean you won?
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   You won money?
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.040]   >> No, I didn't get in the money, but this was every one of the top poker players in
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.600]   the world like Ferguson and Phil Helmuth and all these guys.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   >> What was it fun to sit at the table with the guys like that?
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.840]   >> Yeah, I was at one table, it was like six pros, including the guy who had, has one
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.160]   more tournaments and cash in the last 30 years than anybody.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.600]   And also Shannon Elizabeth, and then the guy from Mad Men, I mean it was just crazy.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.000]   >> Look, I, for all these guys were there, it was very cool.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.320]   >> He knows when to hold him, he knows when to fold him.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.720]   Gina Tupani is also here, formerly, well I don't want to say formerly of Life Hacker,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.480]   you started Life Hacker.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.280]   >> Now it's smarter where.org, but you're still Life Hacker associated, right?
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.200]   >> Yes I am, I still right there once a week and you know, bother all the editors there,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.920]   tell them what I want to see.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.960]   >> I continually go back to Life Hacker, you know, because I'll do a Google search on,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.000]   you know, how to use, what is it, that geek code.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.480]   And then it'll always be a Gina Tupani article about anything I want to do, you've been there
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.480]   first.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   >> Excellent.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   >> Very frustrating.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   >> I'll pay you later, Santa.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.240]   >> Actually it's good that you're there because I don't have to re-do it all.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.720]   Also a newbie with us is his first time on this weekend tech from ABC, Dan Patterson is
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.120]   here, also Dan Patterson.me, hi Dan.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.680]   >> Hey, how are you, Leah?
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.240]   Thanks for having me, I appreciate it.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.800]   >> You were also at Southby, was everybody at Southby Southwest accept me?
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   >> Yes.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   >> Gina, did you go?
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   >> Yes, I did.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.120]   >> Have you not gone at all?
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120]   >> I've never been.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   Can you believe that?
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   >> No, you've got to go.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.120]   >> I would be so optimistic.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.280]   >> But the impression I got this time, and of course this is at a distance, was it was
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.080]   just one big drunken orgy?
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   >> That's about after, yeah.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.720]   >> It was about six or seven nights, that's true, yes.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.360]   >> You know, you can filter through that.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.440]   >> I filtered through it by filtering through Kevin's party and back.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.000]   But it's a big drunken party, but if you have meaningful conversation with people, you
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.360]   really can't connect.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.240]   And I can't tell you what this did for everyone talks about the networking, but really the
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.080]   personal relationships that develop there and evolve there are tremendous.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.560]   So yeah, you can party, but you can also go, I hate to say go to work, but if you go and
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.440]   have the mindset that I'm going to communicate with people and all the tools that we use
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.160]   just kind of facilitate that, you can have a wonderful time and do the parties, but without
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.720]   really getting stuck in the drunken muck.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.920]   >> Were there any great seminars, I mean, you know, sessions that people really enjoyed?
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.240]   Because you don't really hear about those.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.440]   >> Yeah, I'd like to thank mine was.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.400]   I was privileged enough to speak with Lawrence Lessig and Amber Bettinger, Obama Girl.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.640]   Alex Wellen, who is the guy who does all the cool text stuff.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.640]   >> We know Alex pretty well.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.360]   >> He said CNN now, huh?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   >> That's cool.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.120]   Mark McKinnon, who is a campaign strategist.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.560]   So that was humbling just to be on a stage with Lessig.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.640]   It's like smart person, smart person, smart person, Lawrence Lessig.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.440]   >> Kevin, what did you enjoy?
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.440]   >> What did you enjoy?
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.800]   >> Well, I didn't get a lot of time to go to the talks this year.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.800]   I was just in and out.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.360]   I was there for three days and then bounced out.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360]   >> Were you doing meetings?
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.840]   What were you doing that was keeping you busy?
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.640]   >> We've got a big launch coming up in like a week and a half.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.080]   >> Who's we dig or revision three?
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   >> Oh, yeah?
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   You want to tell us anything?
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   >> We talked about a little bit.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:51.480]   We're doing a software based, or not software based, but a web based kind of short URL service
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   with a toolbar.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.400]   It allows you to dig on sites and trade around dig links on networks such as Twitter and
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.040]   Facebook and you name it with these kind of shorter dig URLs.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.520]   And that's got a bunch of different stuff.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.520]   >> That's going to be huge.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.160]   >> It shows you related content from that sort.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   >> That's going to be huge.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   >> It shows you.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.680]   >> Just a whole slew of different features.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.680]   >> Wow.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.680]   >> It's going to be fun.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.880]   >> So I use Bitly right now because I get stats.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.560]   >> Yeah, you get stats with this as well.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560]   >> So I'll get that plus.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.520]   >> Right, and it doesn't even have to be a submitted dig story.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.720]   So you can just go, I think the most brilliant piece of it is how you actually create these.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.320]   So all you have to do is click in your address bar and this doesn't work today but at Wilmone
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   Launch.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.200]   You type in dig.com/ and then leave all the rest of the URL in there that you're on and
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   you hit enter.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.340]   And that passes that full URL to dig and then we re-forward you to the tiny, the shorter
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.340]   dig URL.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.040]   >> And this is so smart because you're going to get a lot of data about what people are
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.080]   interested in over and above what you already get from dig, right?
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.960]   >> Yeah, we see how many people are passing around, how many people are viewing it.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.120]   >> Can you monetize that kind of information?
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.600]   >> Yeah, we're just going to ask that.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   >> You do.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.120]   >> I mean, when you click on the related content within that bar, we have as it folds down
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.360]   the content kind of expands that.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.920]   It's hard for me to explain without you actually seeing it but there's ads on there as well.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.440]   But more than anything, to get more people digging and involved and feeding more data
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   into our system.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   >> It's just really clear.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.520]   I think about it with Twitter.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:17.040]   It's just very clear that all of this activity that's going on is generating a cloud of information
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040]   about what people are interested in.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.160]   I mean, this is what Dig essentially did.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.120]   How do you capture what they're interested in but you know more and more and more.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.120]   >> Right.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.440]   So for us, it's just adding in more of those connections into Dig and refactoring that into
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.960]   our own promotion stuff.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.800]   So we want to look at what's being retweeted.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.920]   That might be a role in Dig's promotion later on.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.920]   We're going to look at a bunch of different sources, see how people are sharing and spreading
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.200]   this information around the web.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.480]   >> Seems huge.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:50.600]   It seems like Scoble's posited that Twitter makes money when he says, "Okay, they made
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   an announcement.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   The Scoble's pregnant.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   Scoble's wife, I think, actually.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.480]   Although it would be quite an announcement if he were pregnant.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   >> It looked like Kevin was about six months pregnant actually.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.480]   >> Robert, you mean?
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.480]   Not Kevin.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.920]   He's getting skinny here.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.280]   I don't know what we're going to do with you.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.440]   But he said, "Now, if Twitter were really on the ball, I should have been receiving tweets
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.600]   about not that I'd want to, but I'd be receiving tweets about stuff that, you know, where to
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   buy my bassinet and baby shoes and stuff like that."
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.080]   Because that information is of use.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.920]   >> Yeah, there was a really, I thought, a great use of Twitter even though it could get
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   very spammy quickly.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   >> That's the problem.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   You're going to be careful.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.440]   >> Just somebody tweeted out that they had a cold and weren't feeling well.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.920]   So ZaiCam, like that nasal spray, monitors the search term cold and send a tweet back
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.920]   to this person like, "Hey, sorry you're not feeling well.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   Here's a coupon."
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.920]   >> That's so smart.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.920]   >> Like 10% off.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   >> It was not crazy.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   >> I think that's so smart.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   >> That was like all automated.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.760]   But I mean, obviously, they're the first to do it.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.760]   So it's kind of cool now.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.440]   But I went 130 different companies like sending me like, "You need these vitamins?"
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.400]   >> How does Twitter stop that?
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   >> It's really cold.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   >> Yes, I did.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   >> How does Twitter stop that though, right?
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.680]   >> Well, they just have to be careful in looking at who's spammy, make sure people aren't
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.040]   sending out hundreds of thousands of these kinds of things.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.640]   >> I want to talk about Facebook too and just a little bit, but I do want to continue
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.880]   to talk about South by Southwest.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.320]   Gina, tell me about your South by Southwest.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   What went on for you there?
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.200]   >> Well, it was my fifth one.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.360]   I've been to the last five, including this year.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   And it was definitely the best one I've ever been to just because I hit on some good
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.600]   panels and just had some good meetings and conversations with people.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.160]   It's true that the sessions are kind of hit or miss, although I did get a couple of good
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.480]   ones this time, but it's really about conversations.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.040]   And I'm not much of a party girl, so that all happens in the hallways mostly for me
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.800]   or at lunch or whatever.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.480]   So it was a good time.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.040]   >> My friend Craig Severs, that does a conference called LobbyCon where it's thought you just
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.280]   have the lobby conversations.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.280]   Forget the presentations.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.720]   >> You're about BaconCon?
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.720]   >> No.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   >> Yeah, it's supposed to be all about Bacon.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   >> That sounds awesome.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   I wouldn't want to go to that.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.280]   >> I don't know.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.280]   I'm over bacon.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.520]   I can't eat bacon anymore.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.920]   Jason, what was your...
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.960]   I know, I know, shocking.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.480]   There is a website called...
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.120]   I think it's Baconizer that'll add bacon to any website.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.120]   >> Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   Baconator.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   >> The Baconator.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.120]   That was one of my favorites.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.880]   You just add the URL in front and creates a piece of bacon for bacon on your site.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.120]   >> I don't really get it, but okay.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.920]   Jason, how about you?
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.720]   What's it like for a Wheeler-Dierler like you at Austin?
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.680]   Austin, where's that?
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   >> You didn't go?
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.680]   >> No, I didn't go.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.320]   I have too much work to do.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   I've been.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.320]   I really enjoyed it, actually.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.320]   It's a great conference because...
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.040]   >> It seems like a very friendly conference.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.320]   >> What's good about it is, is most of the conferences that Kevin and I go to, and...
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.680]   They're like CEOs and marketers and VCs.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.160]   It's not actually people who do work.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.400]   It's people who take credit for other people's work.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.720]   And so when I go to South by Southwest, it's like you get to sit in the audience and actually
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.120]   hear people who actually do real work talk about how they do their work.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.160]   And it's a much more interesting conference, although those people tend to not be the best
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.400]   speakers, but they tend to have the most insights.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.240]   So you have to deal with a little less polish.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.000]   >> I prefer that.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   >> I prefer that.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   >> Don't you think that's a bar camp?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   You know, when it's a bar camp, then it's like...
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   >> You get the bar camp.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.840]   >> You go by because it is people who may not be professionals.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.560]   You also get the energy of people who don't have professional life dragging down their
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   energy.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.640]   But it's a wonderful chance to meet people in all levels of three different industries,
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   really.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.960]   Well, maybe someday I'll go.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.960]   >> I'm telling you next year what we should do is we should rent out...
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.200]   We did stubs this year for the dignity and stuff.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.520]   But let's rent out something over the entire day, pick a day, like on the weekend.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.520]   >> Just take over somewhere.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.520]   >> And just take over somewhere.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.520]   >> And do back to back different parties.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.520]   >> I'd love to do that.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   >> You bring Twit, like we'll do all the different ones that we do.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   >> We'll stream the whole thing.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   >> That'd be fun.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.080]   >> Jason and I were talking about getting a rock and roll bus.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080]   >> Yum.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.080]   >> That would have been fun.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.080]   >> Driving there.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.080]   >> Yeah, driving there.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.880]   >> We're doing a next week party bus.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.080]   >> We just didn't have enough time, Jason.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.520]   But if we start planning now, yeah, we'll get party bus.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.760]   >> Tyler, we'll take care of it for next year.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.760]   You can rent one of these...
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.760]   >> They're not expenses.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.760]   >> The tour bus is like whatever.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.760]   A big couple of grand.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.760]   >> They sleep 12.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.000]   >> And we're going to shoot it like real world style?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   >> It will be, absolutely.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Well, then one person has to get off the bus in each city.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   >> Well, that's right.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   >> Phoenix.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   >> We'll do some...
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   >> Alex Hallbreak, you're off the bus.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   >> Survivor, I love it.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.440]   >> You get pretty good bandwidth on the satellite internet so you can be doing stuff while driving.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   >> We'll all have VVDO cards.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   >> Nap, though.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440]   >> I think we could just...
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   >> You're just bouncing on a ball, Leo, is that?
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   >> Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   You didn't notice that I like to bounce.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   >> That's awesome.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   >> I get excited I bounce.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   It's a little creepy.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.440]   >> That's just happy bounce.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.840]   >> I look like Tigger behind the desk.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.440]   >> We're going to go on a bus to Austin.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:55.880]   So I think if we rent this bus, we stop and do tweetups and broadcasts all the way like
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:02.160]   San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, on the way.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160]   And then we get to Austin.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.400]   And then I think you're right, we get a venue for the whole day.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   >> Okay, we're going to do this.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   >> You know, I'm serious.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.400]   I'm down.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   >> Well, you guys will get a venue and do...
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.280]   You can have a place for a couple of days.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.840]   Maybe it was long to get down there.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.400]   >> David thinks big.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   That's what I like about Prager.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.400]   >> He thinks big.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   >> You need a still for Prager that you can pull off, which is like him and then...
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.400]   >> I know.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.680]   >> So what was saying they could see my screen over like maybe...
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.680]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   When I go...
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.680]   >> Stop voting the porn Prager.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.680]   >> We can see what you're looking at.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.680]   >> Porno's dupe.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.560]   >> So they're talking about the live video stream and I've got cameras for everybody except
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.560]   David.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.560]   >> Oh, you can see my screen.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.560]   We know what you're browsing, dude.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.560]   >> I'm going to pop something up bad.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   >> What were you looking at?
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.560]   >> Give a seven-second delay, right?
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.560]   You can bleep it out.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.560]   >> No.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.120]   No, I do not.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.800]   Let's talk about the new Facebook because boy, they're getting a lot of heat.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.720]   I just saw a BBC article that said something like 83% of people responding said they hate
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   it.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   There's a petition with millions of names on it.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   >> These are millions now?
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.560]   >> Millions of names.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.880]   I hate Facebook.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.880]   >> Wow.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.000]   >> Is there a way to determine if this is like any more backlash than the last iteration?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I mean, it seems like they...
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.040]   >> It's a bigger change than the last iteration.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.040]   Don't you think?
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.240]   I mean, it really changes the way...
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.240]   >> Really?
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.240]   >> What's the complaint?
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.240]   What's the main complaint?
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   >> Confusion.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   >> Confusion?
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.600]   >> That's a core of the issue.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.440]   They wouldn't say they're confused, but people are really confused.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.040]   Imagine you see the Twitter box for the first time and you used to see in the news feed.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   It's like, what is this?
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.320]   What do I do now?
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   I like the old thing.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.320]   >> This might be a lot of...
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.600]   I don't want to say bubble thinking and I'm glad to see Facebook trying to change or at
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.000]   least train their audience to use something that is more like Twitter.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.480]   But one of the problems I encounter, whether it's at work at ABC or even with my friends
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:53.040]   when I evangelize the stuff, it's very, very difficult to explain what this is for the
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.920]   Neo fight and to log into Facebook for the first time and see something that looks like
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.920]   Twitter for our audience, for your audience, it's very familiar and you kind of feel comfortable
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.920]   with it.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.640]   Or my mother or my mother's friend, it's what?
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.920]   Why is it so fast?
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.920]   This isn't...
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   This is too much data.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   >> Right.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.840]   See, that's the thing I was worried about because with Twitter, it feels to me as though
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   it's just enough to consume because it's little updates from your friends.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   It's simple.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.600]   And then when you think about everything that Facebook is bringing together with pictures
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.160]   and events and everything else going on, it just seems like a little bit of an overload.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.080]   >> Yeah, I mean, the first thing you see you go there, you say welcome.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.080]   What's on your mind?
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.080]   It's very...
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   I mean, it looks just like Twitter's stream.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.800]   You don't immediately see on the left that you can look at.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.200]   >> You know what it looks like more than Twitter?
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   It looks like pounce.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   I mean, it's pounce.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   >> And you know what happened to them.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   >> Hey, I'm happy with the count.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   >> Well, I think it's...
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.000]   >> Yeah, everybody got hired.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   >> Everybody got hired.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   We got stock in six apart.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   We got cash.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   >> Oh, good.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   >> Like it was a good deal for everybody.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   >> So that's a good way for you to get in a lane safely.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.960]   >> I'm seeing the six apart guys on Tuesday, and one of the things that they really will
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.280]   be running moveable type on the new radio website, and one of the things that they're
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.320]   really stoked about, like the thing that amps them up is...
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.720]   I don't remember what they call it, flow or something like that, but it's the integration
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   of pounds.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.680]   I was playing around on my own servers, and it was wonderful to be able to integrate that
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.120]   with all of my other content internally.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.080]   >> Yeah, I've seen some of the stuff they've been working on.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.080]   It's pretty, pretty cool stuff.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.080]   >> Anyway, back to Facebook.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.800]   >> Yeah, I will say the fan pages are much better.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.280]   Have you messed around with the fan pages?
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.360]   >> Yeah, so the idea is that now, see, I have, and I'm sure you had this issue too, we put
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.000]   everybody on our regular page.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   >> Right.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   >> So you hit 5,000 pretty quick.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.440]   >> Did they move you over to a new fan page?
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.240]   >> I have a fan, I've always had a fan page.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   Is there like a button I could push?
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.740]   >> Did you hit the 5,000 on your normal page?
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.740]   >> Oh, long time ago.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.480]   >> Okay, so we'll get them to move all those people over to your fan page.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.640]   >> You're gonna call Mark?
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.080]   >> Do you want, well, do you have, I had it done too.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.320]   There is an issue though.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   >> No, wait a minute.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   >> Facebook.com/Liliport.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.840]   >> I don't know.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.840]   >> We'll get you that too.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.320]   >> Wow, it's good to get that.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   >> So the idea is now we with Facebook.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   >> Yeah, we.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.440]   >> Not be saying you, you and Mark are being like this.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.320]   >> They call me, like Dave Marin's the main guy, kind of spearheading this.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   >> Oh Dave, yeah.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.320]   >> Randy, you should have it like a bird.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   >> Yeah, I'd love to have Dave on.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.320]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.960]   >> And he was like, hey, we're starting this new thing, you might want to check it out,
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.200]   and you told me like basically, they're going to this openness to where they want people
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.200]   to have their own identity.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.840]   So it's gonna be like Facebook.com/KevinRose that works right now.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.440]   >> Now would that be your private page or your fan page?
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.440]   >> No, that's my fan page, right?
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.480]   >> But your fan page, you maintain in the same way that you do your private page.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   You post stuff there.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   >> Right, exactly.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.480]   >> But it's just public.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.480]   >> The cool thing though is that it used to be they'd have to go back to the fan page
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   to check it out, you know, to see if you did anything.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   >> Yeah, now it's on your stuff.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.480]   >> So if you go and post something, it goes out to all the people that have failed.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.000]   >> Well, and the other thing I thought was really interesting is that they've gone to
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.480]   basically an open model.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.400]   The data is now accessible anywhere, right?
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.320]   >> Yeah, so they have APIs coming out for that.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.360]   So basically, you know, we use services like Twirl and Tweed Deck and all these others.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.360]   >> Right.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.160]   >> You're gonna see a whole slew of applications interfaced with--
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.360]   >> Well, I'm using Seasonic for Facebook.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.680]   >> Right, so you've seen Seasonic.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   >> I think that's pretty cool.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   >> Yeah, that's just like Twirl.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   >> Is it all the real time I'm worried about it?
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   >> So Twirl people, yeah.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680]   >> So the question is, is it--
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.880]   >> But even more than that, I can now say every, I can make everyone, instead of having
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.240]   it be private, I can now make it for everyone that's a new setting.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.720]   And so presumably, other sites could scrape that information as well, right?
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.400]   In other words, your profile is no longer kind of your personal profile.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.920]   >> Right, exactly, it's more of a public thing.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   >> But you do control it.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.840]   >> Right, you control it what goes in there, but it's more of a public thing.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   >> So is this a good move?
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:37.160]   I mean, given all the backlash, the confusion that Dan posited, is this a good move for them?
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.560]   Scoble wrote an interesting thing, he said, "Mark should not listen to all the complaints.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.400]   They don't know what they're talking about."
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.400]   This is a tough thing, though.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.400]   You're in the same boat.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   I'm sure you get the same thing.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.840]   I'm sure, Jason, you get the same thing when you change something on Mahalo or when you change
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.840]   things on a gadget.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.360]   Is the people don't like change of any kind for one thing?
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.080]   >> I think that's difficult for me, as I always looked at the services, is serving two different
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.920]   things, two different types of audiences, right?
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.320]   Twitter for me was always more real-time.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.000]   Facebook was where I went to connect with just a tight group of people, just my friends.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   >> Yes, sure.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Your high school buddies, your college buddies.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   >> Your college buddies.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.320]   >> My knees, all this stuff, right?
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.800]   And it's like now the two together, I don't know how I feel about it yet.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   I think it's too early.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.160]   >> I think Facebook has to be able to do what, I mean, Twitter's got all the buzz, and I
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.200]   think rightly deserved, I mean, we can't stop talking about it all the time, it's because
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.800]   of what it allows us to do.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.040]   >> I get so much heat, this is why Devorek is not on this episode because it constantly
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   berates me for talking about it.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.040]   >> Facebook has to be.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.040]   >> But it's the story, I'm sorry.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.000]   >> Facebook's platform allows you to have that kind of interaction, and I mean, whether
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.240]   it's true or not, I mean, they kind of want to be able to have a piece of that pie and
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.560]   provide that functionality.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.720]   And so I think- >> Well, here's a good part of the
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.320]   reason you see the homepage the way it is, is because they want to be able to grab what
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.680]   it is that Twitter has.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.760]   >> Here's what Scoble says, what if you had him, sorry to keep bringing Robert up, this
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.760]   is the last time.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.000]   >> Bob, he was my Bob actually, isn't that what you're saying?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.440]   >> Bob, yeah, Bobby Scoble.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.440]   Sometimes Bobby.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   >> That's right, Bobby.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.880]   >> You're joking, he goes by Bob?
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.120]   >> I didn't, no, I'm serious.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.240]   He signs some of his emails as a Bob Scoble.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.040]   Like somebody told me that the other day, I'm like, really?
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   >> I think there's an imposter.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.200]   >> He's trying to read himself.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.000]   >> Sort of like Robert Redford.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   >> Yeah, Bob.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.480]   >> If you know Robert, we call him Bob.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.480]   >> You know what we mean.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.800]   >> This guy's name over here is Bob, you can call him Bob Rose.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.280]   >> Dr. Robert, that's what we call him.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.240]   From the good old days, from back when.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.560]   >> So he said, what if you have, and I use the Facebook, and one nice thing is if you
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.760]   use the Facebook application, the iPhone is still the same old Facebook.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.400]   But what if you used it kind of more like Twitter and said, here I am, and it suddenly
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   got information.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.240]   Robert said, okay, what if you said, I'm looking for a good restaurant, oh, 12 of your
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.400]   friends like the Bangkok kitchen next door.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.240]   Now it's interesting, because these are recommendations from your friends.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   >> They're real friends.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.560]   >> All these services are kind of like starting to overlap each other.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.160]   You play with Four Square at all yet?
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.240]   >> That was huge itself.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.280]   >> That's the new app that allows you to, well it's location based.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.760]   So if you have an, I think the iPhone's the big platform for it, now they create an iPhone
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.320]   app and so you open it up and you can add who you are actually personally friends with
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.680]   or anyone I guess.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.760]   And so it's kind of like what dodgeball used to be.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760]   >> It is the same guy.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.720]   In fact, there's some concern that maybe it's the same code.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.120]   >> But it's a little bit more well done, I think.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.760]   >> It's cool because it adds like a social gaming component to it as well.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.760]   Have you seen how this works?
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.760]   They give you badges?
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.960]   >> No, I couldn't because I was not anywhere important.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.320]   >> So let's say you're out and you're like having dinner with your friends and you're
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.200]   like, oh, I really like this place, it's a good burger joint or whatever, right?
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.640]   You check in, so you say, and then it uses GPS, it talks to Yelp and it says, is this
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.880]   the location you're talking about?
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.680]   So you just check into a burger place.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.800]   If you check in there like four or five times, you become the mayor of that place by checking
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   in.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800]   >> I love it.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   >> And then you compete with other people.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   And so they have, so it's a game.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   It's a game.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   They have these other things.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.360]   You can check in at three different bars.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.240]   It gives you the bender badge.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.120]   If you check in with like three people of the opposite sex, you get the player, please
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   badge.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.360]   So you can play your badge.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.920]   It's really, it's really kind of fun.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.520]   >> But right now only Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver, LA, you have to be in a metro to do
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.520]   this.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.520]   >> I think this would fall under augmented reality.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.440]   It's like mixing call of duty four with real life.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.080]   >> Well, you need the weapons then is what you're saying.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.120]   How many headshots do I need to get to get the headshot badge with the AK-47?
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.440]   >> Call of duty reference for those people.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.400]   >> Gina, did you use, did you use play four square when you were in Austin?
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   Did you play?
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   >> I didn't.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   I'm sad that I didn't.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   >> It sounds like me.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.160]   >> I'm a slow adopter, this social media crap.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.160]   I don't know.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.640]   >> But I think what's interesting here is you're taking, I hate using this term, the social
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:36.080]   graph, people's social graph and integrating it with location, another buzzword, and to
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.080]   make it something that's really powerful.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   >> Right.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   Absolutely.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   I mean, last night I was out with friends, I went and got some food, and then I pulled
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.160]   up my four square and I was like, okay, what is everybody doing?
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.320]   I could see, okay, Joe checked in at this bar, I had another friend that checked in at this
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.200]   place, and so you can instantly decide, like, where do I want to spend my time tonight,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   right?
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   >> Right.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   >> By seeing where your friends are checking in.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.520]   >> Now, Dodgeball kind of did this and was a flop, so what's going to make this?
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:02.120]   >> Well, Dodgeball was a little too, like, you had to go in and manually kind of text
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.200]   in the place where you're at.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.960]   This is like two pushes of a button.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   >> It brings up the location.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   >> Because it has location, it ties in with the L.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   >> That's the key.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   >> This is the new Dodgeball.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.480]   >> And you can click and say, I'm here too, in two seconds.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.520]   >> It almost encourages you to keep your network quiet and keep it small, like Evan said.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.840]   If you trade it like Twitter and you're following a bajillion people, then, you know, there's
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.680]   very little difference other than the location, but it was fantastic and lost them to kind
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.760]   of know a dozen or so people floating around the city and kind of know that this is our
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.960]   little, you know, there's an elitism to it, but it's kind of like, hey, we're the early
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.160]   adopters and we're gathering and I can see where my people are and the people that they're
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.160]   talking to.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   And I can kind of see interactions and relationships being built by knowing that two or more people
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.400]   are in the same location.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.920]   >> And I also think there's a lot of like, quote unquote, high-roll or Twitter people
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.480]   that were at South by Interactive.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.120]   And so they want to tell people where they are without telling their $100,000 followers.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.440]   So you have your friends who are there with you and you can make it so it only updates
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.920]   for other people in Austin and then they can see where you are.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.880]   You can see where they are without having to deal with telling 100,000 people plus where
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.240]   you are and what's going on, especially if they don't care.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.200]   >> Yeah, that's useful for sure.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   >> I just need to spread it around.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.680]   >> I'd like to ask you guys going, not to not to backtrack on Facebook too much, but
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:22.240]   I'd really like to ask you guys your thoughts on Facebook connect beyond the just the credentialing
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.320]   log in structure that it has.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:30.960]   I'm curious to see the data because you can push all of your comments and all of this
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.560]   activity around the social web.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.520]   And Leo, I agree on the jargon.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.040]   We need to move away from the jargon.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   >> Well, that's the key.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.960]   >> But you know, you, right, exactly, exactly.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   But being able to pull all that information into Facebook does a couple things.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.320]   It changes the game a little bit, I think.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.920]   All of a sudden it brings the entire web into Facebook and of course they can monetize
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:58.640]   that data on the back end, but it also introduces these networks of networks to people who
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.840]   may not be familiar with the social web and how it works.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.920]   But they're so prone to putting out, you know, vaporware or-
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.000]   >> I use Facebook connect, but hold on.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   >> I think it's wonderful.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   >> Hold that thought because I do want to find out what people think about that.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.920]   And I still want to talk a little bit more about Facebook, but there are a lot of other
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   stories.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:22.880]   Two Cisco bot flip video, Sun may be sold to IBM, the iPhone 3.0, Kevin, you nailed it.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.720]   Dude, he's got the best sources in the world.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.040]   We're going to talk more about that in a second.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   >> Good.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.600]   >> And you, you got a rumor.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.320]   You got a rumor, dude.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.760]   There it is as this flip HD.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.760]   >> There it is.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.760]   >> I got one too here.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.760]   >> You show offs.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.760]   >> You got to have one.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.760]   >> I got more cameras than you do.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.240]   >> So what do you think about Cisco's purchase?
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.000]   >> Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Hold your horse.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   >> I got to pay the bills.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.760]   >> I got to pay the bills, baby.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.760]   Got to pay some bills.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.800]   And then Jason, I also- >> What was the advertisement?
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.600]   Please don't tell me it's audible.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   >> It isn't.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   Stop.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   >> Play.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   >> What could it be?
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   >> Well, go to meeting.com.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   >> No, no.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   You won't guess this one.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   It's a new advertising.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   >> Oh.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   Oh.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.920]   You know how I love new advertisers?
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.640]   >> Is that a pint?
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   Are you drinking a pint?
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.320]   I think he's getting a little- >> Yeah, I'm having a little Coke Zero.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   Look Coke Zero in his.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.040]   >> Did you buy that soda making machine that you were hitting?
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.520]   >> No, I got that as at a gift bag, but that thing is crazy.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.560]   >> I don't think I want anything that makes soda in my life.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.440]   That's not a good thing to have in your life.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440]   It's cool for the planet though.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.920]   You just like go- >> That's true.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   No more bottles.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   >> You never have to go buy bottles.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.280]   >> There's a service up here in the Bay Area called the CELTSER Sisters.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.760]   You should do this if you guys live in the city.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760]   >> The CELTSER Sisters.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   >> The CELTSER Sisters.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.600]   They come around with- they bought old and refurbished old 20 CELTSER bottles.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.360]   You know the three stooges that stick in the pants?
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.360]   CELTSER bottles?
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.360]   >> That's hot.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.840]   >> They fill in- >> Not really.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.360]   It's actually not very pleasant at all.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.640]   They fill in with CELTSER and they bring syrup around and everything and you get weekly deliveries
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.200]   of these classic old 20s are beautiful glass CELTSER bottles.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   >> Isn't San Francisco?
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   CELTSER Sisters.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.200]   You should do it.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.200]   Anyway, we're going to come back.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.480]   We're going to talk more about the social graph.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.240]   I'm going to ask Kevin Rose what the hell that means.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.840]   But I want to welcome a new sponsor to the show.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:16.200]   We're talking carbonight, carbonight.com, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:23.000]   I'm not a stranger to carbonite.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.160]   I started using carbonite when I lost some podcasts.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.800]   I accidentally deleted some podcasts.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.240]   I had no backup.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.560]   I said I got to find something.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.040]   Carbonite is so cool.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.360]   You go to C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.320]   Less than five bucks a month and this is why I like it for unlimited backup.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.120]   Now see these podcasts are big but I didn't have to measure how big they were going to
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.120]   be.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.720]   The folders you want to save, your financial documents, your email, your music, your photos,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.400]   those irreplaceable documents, your podcasts, you right click on it.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   What's the off-road?
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   What's the off-road?
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400]   Leo.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   Leo.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.240]   You right click on it and the folder and you say save to carbonite from then on.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.240]   That's it.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.240]   It's done.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   Boom.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.240]   Automatically any changes they're automatically backed up.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.240]   It is amazing.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.280]   It's 128-bit encrypted on its way up.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.440]   It's 128-bit encrypted there twice.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.160]   So your privacy is protected.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.840]   No extra hardware needed.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.440]   For covering files, just a few clicks.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.680]   You can even use carbonite to transfer files to a new computer.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.640]   I know a lot of people when they get a new hard drive, they say no problem.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   I got carbonite.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   Boom.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.800]   Look, you're going to lose data but the thing is if you're using carbonite, you're not
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.200]   going to lose it for long.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.360]   PC and Mac now and you can try it for free for two weeks.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.360]   Go to carbonite.com.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.000]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Off-road code.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I'm sorry, Twit.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.240]   The off-road is Twit, not Leo.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.600]   I just took out my credit card.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   Here's my credit card.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   You don't need it.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   I put it away.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   I don't need it.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   Don't put it on the video.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   We got the number there.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.600]   Don't put it on the video.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   I was covering up the numbers when you do that.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.200]   Oh, you're smart, Jason.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.640]   That wasn't a black card either.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.640]   That was a red card.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   Is that for sure?
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.680]   No, you know, I didn't get the black card.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.680]   That was a ripoff.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.840]   It's like 40 grand, right?
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.520]   You have to spend a decent amount of money and I qualified for it and then they sent
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.240]   me the package and stuff and $4,500 a year.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.600]   I was like, how is it different than the platinum card?
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.240]   It's black.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   It's all about status.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.480]   It's all about whipping the thing out.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.840]   I already have a friend of mine.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   I have an orange card.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   A friend of mine.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.840]   Orange is plenty.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   The money is distilled.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.640]   A friend of mine has a black card and all the pleasure is in putting it on the table.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   That's the whole thing.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.440]   Well, actually the cool thing about it is it is made out of metal.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   It's made out of metal.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.800]   When you set it down in the table, it's like me being thunk when it goes on the table and
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.760]   you basically say like, I have the biggest card.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.760]   I am.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   What it is.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   I win.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.760]   It's like turning over the nuts.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.600]   What if it always was like this concierge type service?
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.800]   You get that on platinum too.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   You get that on platinum.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.800]   But you can say, hey, go get this and someone will just do it with the trouble of getting
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   it.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.840]   I get the research online and there's a channel like a message board of people who worked
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.600]   at American Express and they said it's the same exact group of people who do platinum
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.320]   and gold and that and they're told to just be a little nicer to the people with the black
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   cards.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.320]   That's the guy said.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.800]   He said, no, Mr.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.560]   It's like first or business or coach.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.000]   They basically just it's how nice they treat you.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.160]   When you're in coach, they hate you.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.760]   It's how long before you get there like they like you.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.600]   And then when you're first, they love you.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   It's just totally out of time.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   Anyway, you don't need it.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.600]   Put it away.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.600]   Carbonite.com.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.600]   This is good.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.600]   Offer code.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   Twit.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   TWIT.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.600]   TWIT.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.000]   And if you sign up afterwards, you get two months free.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   That's the deal.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   And that good thing is if every because we have 6,200 people watching live and there's
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.680]   a couple of hundred people in the chat room.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.180]   If everybody signs up for this right now and does the two week trial, you know the carbon
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.160]  ite people are going to sign up for the year.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.280]   So if everybody loves this week in tech and the work that Leo puts into it, you're obligated
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.000]   to go to carbonite right now.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Carbonite.com and sign up because Kevin Rose loves it.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Jason, do I need my car?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.640]   Because I'm about to pull my credit card.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.120]   Do I need my card right now or no?
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.200]   It's going to be metal stuff on the table when you pull it out.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.640]   Kevin, no, it's Jason Calcanis here.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.880]   Kevin Rose, you don't need it.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   For carbonite.com.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   I'll put this away then.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.880]   Okay.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   You can put the credit card away.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.880]   You guys need a two-way trial of carbonite.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.080]   We got two more commercials.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.360]   If we do this for every commercial, it's not going to be a show.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.360]   I'm just trying to get it.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.600]   I appreciate it.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.240]   I appreciate it.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   Thank you very much.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.240]   You guys are fantastic.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   I think we broke their system.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.080]   It's like 8,000 people signing up this sometime.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.160]   Hey, it's free.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.160]   Why not?
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   No credit card needed.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   Nope.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.160]   Carbonite.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.160]   Carbonite.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.240]   And thank you very much, Jason, for your support.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   Carbonite.com.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.240]   You're a great offer code, "Twit."
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.800]   All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   So Facebook Connect, I do love Facebook Connect.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.960]   You know what I think is Dan's going on is really, it's all of these guys.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.200]   It's just like you using a short code on Dig, you know, doing a short.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.440]   These are just methods of finding out what people are doing, right?
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   Absolutely.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   And that's inherently valuable.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.280]   I mean, it doesn't mean Facebook's going to put an ad on that.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:03.400]   You know, Leo, one of the things I constantly tell, when I have meetings with the various
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:09.320]   departments within ABC News throughout the work week and kind of explain how to do this,
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.600]   I put it in as small of layper instance terms as possible.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.640]   But I meet with different departments, so I see their different needs.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.240]   And one of the things I always tell people is, look, if Google is the path of least resistance
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.840]   between you and information, then Twitter is the path of least resistance between you
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.000]   and people.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.720]   And I think the more Facebook iterates and moves towards the Twitter model with that 150 million
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.960]   active users, it could become exceptionally relevant for broadcast.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.320]   You know, previously it moved slower, it was a little quieter.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:46.120]   But if they can train their users to kind of accept this new model with Twitter is okay
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:52.200]   with 6 million users, but 150 million on Facebook is nothing to a significant.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:57.400]   75 now, they're growing at the size of three Twitter's, Twitter every three weeks.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.680]   Yeah, but Twitter has grown pretty fast themselves.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.560]   Yeah, thirteen hundred percent growth in the last year.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.280]   At least Facebook posits the right question.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.360]   They say, what's on your mind?
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.240]   I'm surprised Twitter didn't change it to like, what do you feel like saying it?
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.440]   It just says, what are you doing?
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.960]   What's on your mind is much better than what are you doing, isn't it?
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.320]   Nobody pays any attention to that, do they?
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.080]   We say, I have an observation about this thing with Facebook.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.800]   One is about Zuckerberg.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.680]   Yeah, you're friends with him, Kevin.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.360]   I've had dinner with him once at Ted and I met him a couple of times and he's a really
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.280]   bright kid, but it's pretty obvious that like he thinks he knows like what the best thing
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.800]   to do is and really doesn't care what anybody else thinks.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.400]   I think he's pretty like determined.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.560]   I think that's just fine.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.720]   It's a great character.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.180]   And he, I keep hearing he wants to model himself after Bill Gates and he keeps using that
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.180]   Bill Gates metaphor.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.080]   Well, that might not be so smart, but.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.280]   Well, actually, you know what?
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.400]   It's actually, he's definitely doing it because he basically took somebody else's idea,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.400]   he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.400]   he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.400]   he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.400]   he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.400]   he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.400]   he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because he's doing it because
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.120]   Twitter is original.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   Dig was original.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.120]   I mean, there are original ideas out there.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   But you don't have to be original.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.120]   This is pretty blatant.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.120]   This is pretty blatant.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.120]   But is it a mistake?
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.120]   It comes after...
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.080]   No, it's not a mistake, but it's going to cause a lot of pain in the short term because
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.280]   people who use Facebook are not bloggers.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.040]   They're usually has a Rolodex primarily an email system.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   Yeah, I mean, they're there to find out what their college, their high school girlfriend's
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.120]   up to what their brother's up to.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.120]   But can they turn around?
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.280]   They should have done it in phases.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.600]   It's a matter of getting the right amount of data in front of the people where it doesn't
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.680]   make them feel overwhelmed, right?
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:59.080]   Because right now I think they have it turn full throttle a little bit.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.560]   I don't know if you've logged in recently and if you have some active friends, all of
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.640]   a sudden you're like, "I feel like I missed something because there's just too much going
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.640]   on."
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.640]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   Twitter's like that.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.640]   I mean, you get...
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.640]   Yeah, but Twitter's for me is different because it is about...
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   It's the same 140 characters every time.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.640]   It's not about...
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   It's not about...
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.080]   Did I miss a photo of my niece or did I miss an event or did I miss...
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.080]   Like someone breaking it?
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.840]   We all suffer from overwhelm, information overload.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.680]   We don't want to add to that.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.520]   You want a tool like Facebook to make you feel like you're managing it.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:32.960]   I think that the good thing about Mark and what Facebook has done thus far is they do
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.760]   listen to the community and they go back and make iterations of this stuff.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.200]   He did that with the terms of service.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   I thought that was really responsive.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.560]   And how many times have they changed the news feed in the last couple of years?
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.200]   I mean, they're constantly tweaking this stuff.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.160]   But you can do too much listening to the community too.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.880]   I mean, you can lose your way.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.760]   Yeah, you can finally get a throw.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.800]   Gina, do you use Facebook, right?
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   I do.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.280]   I don't use it a whole lot.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.040]   In the past, I've really kind of accused Facebook of being this company that has Asperger's
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.400]   because they've been very good at responding to their users.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.560]   I mean, the privacy thing they did.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.960]   But I have to say, in this case, I kind of agree with Scoble.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.840]   We've all run big websites and we know how people react when there are any kinds of
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.840]   changes.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   Any change drives them crazy.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   Any change at all.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.600]   I mean, if this many users are freaking out three weeks from now, a month from now, then
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.280]   OK, there might be something to it.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:25.080]   But honestly, I just feel like these things need time and people feel upset when things
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   might no change.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.480]   I agree with her 100%.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:32.880]   You kind of have to sit, sit back, step away for a few weeks and watch and say, is this
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.280]   a big deal with the community a couple weeks from now?
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.360]   Because oftentimes, it's kind of the vocal minority initially.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.520]   And it's important to listen to people.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.520]   Oh, a million petitions.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.520]   Is it a million now?
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.400]   Can they be at the BBC and see what they see?
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   Yeah, it's over a million.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.400]   It's over a million.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.600]   Well, still though, you know, like, you know, like, sent broadcast mentor always used to
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.000]   say you cannot program a radio station by committee.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.600]   You have to have one music director.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.160]   And I think it's the same thing with Facebook.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.880]   They should listen and they should pay attention.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.960]   They should care.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:06.000]   But they shouldn't make business decisions based on some some very small, but very vocal
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   community.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.280]   All right, let me put you all on the spot.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.040]   Is Facebook going to lose users because of this?
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.040]   Kevin, no way.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.400]   David, I don't think so.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   Dan says no.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.400]   Gina, no.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.400]   Jason is, Jason.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.400]   No, no.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.400]   But he may lose some employees because employees.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:29.200]   Yeah, I'll tell you why, you know, if you're going to be sort of draconian about like saying,
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.360]   like, Hey, here's what we're going to do.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.080]   And your entire team says like, Oh, we should have done it a different way.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:39.000]   You know, you could wind up losing good people and more of the adults around him might get
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.880]   a little tired of this because it seems to be a pattern.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.600]   I mean, I think he sort of shoots first and then he sort of pulls back.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.080]   It is his first startup company.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.800]   Did this come from Mark or did this come from Dave?
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.440]   Yeah, I suppose it's came from Mark and suppose it was an email that says, you know, he said,
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.440]   like, Oh, well, we have to, this is, I just run attack me.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.600]   But who knows if it's true, but he's just sort of like, we have to be disruptive and,
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.360]   you know, our users will get used to it, which is a very Steve Jobs approach.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.320]   I mean, Steve doesn't give a damn what users think.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.480]   Where's the right mouse?
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.040]   But on, you know, the mouse.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.160]   I still, you know, first thing I bought a $5,000 Mac Pro.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.880]   The first thing I do is throw out the mouse.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.400]   Can you put a good mouse in?
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.400]   They have never been good.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.920]   They need to replace that one mouse engineer, right?
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.880]   We have the hockey puck, remember that thing?
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.680]   I got, look, I got one right here.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.360]   You know that guy is just like, Mighty Mouse?
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.360]   Yeah, and then you have the Mighty Mouse.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.760]   This is for the IMac.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.480]   This was the, this mouse.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.320]   It's round, no hand except maybe a three year olds can fit this thing.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   This is the worst piece of stuff.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.120]   This is because Steve Jobs makes a decision about certain things.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.840]   And when he makes a decision, he's making the decision based on somebody who doesn't
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.840]   do a lot of work on their computer.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.760]   Oh, so he's smart.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.760]   Nicely, oh.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.760]   I think it's a good look.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.760]   That's a good look.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.760]   You know, it's like a solo.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.760]   It is.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.240]   It's kind of like a, I'm going to wear this to South by Southwest this year.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.360]   When the iPhone came out, you couldn't send multiple people SMS messages because apparently
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.360]   Steve Jobs said, well, why would you want to do that?
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.360]   So why would you?
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.360]   Right.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.360]   You still can't do that, by the way.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.360]   You bought the same thing with the key.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   You're doing that now.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.360]   Yeah, you've been able to do it for, it was a firmware.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.840]   No, but there's a SMS to multiple people and then.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.240]   Oh, you can on the iPhone?
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.240]   Oh.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.400]   And then the next top, of course, which should have come out, you know, the cut and paste
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.720]   capabilities, the email search capabilities, half of the common sense things that I still
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   don't know why the iPhone did.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.200]   I think Mr. Rose deserves a victory lap at this point.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.200]   You hit it.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   Did you said everything?
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   They're right, right?
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   Everything was.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   There was some good rumors there.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   You got every one of them.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   You have.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.760]   Have you gotten the television rumor, Kevin?
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   Because I got this twice.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.920]   Yeah, I'm going to, I got to call you on this one because Jason, you said this six months
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.920]   ago that there was a year and a half.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.520]   There was going to be like a 24 inch TV.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.720]   I've heard they're talking about an LCD TV.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   Yeah, I've never heard that.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   Has a computer built into it.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   You never heard it.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.920]   Well, the thing is it's not like you can, you can have one source for all Apple rumors.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.920]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.080]   Like they're very segmented and they're very kind of tight and you have to talk to a certain
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.280]   person about the iPhone versus a certain person.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.920]   But you're not reaching out to people.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   Are you?
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.400]   You just have the world's biggest transom.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.440]   I mean, people throw stuff at you.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:10.200]   You know, I think what happens is I get some anonymous emails from people that I know their
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.080]   signatures by now and they kind of are like, hey, and then.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.520]   So you know whether to trust them or not.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   Right, exactly.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.320]   And then also people come up with conferences all the time.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   They're like, hey, I work at Apple, check this out.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.720]   And then stay somewhere quick and you're like, hell yeah.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.040]   I have to say, since Steve's been gone, it seems like there's much less, it's much less
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.000]   tight than it used to be of a tight ship.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.480]   You couldn't find anything for a while.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.080]   Yeah, it was really, really tight.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.080]   It was really tight.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.080]   Impossible.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   You heard you knew it was wrong because nobody's going to take the chance of getting fired.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.440]   The national dictator.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.120]   Just out of curiosity and clearly I'm not going to ask to reveal your sources.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.600]   But how worried are the people there?
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.400]   I deal with the DC wonks and I deal with the UN wonks a lot.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:58.360]   But how paranoid are people within Apple about their confidentiality?
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.160]   I mean, clearly there's a background in off-record type of situation.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.480]   But are they worried about any type of backlash?
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.480]   I don't think so.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.080]   I mean, if people walk up to you to conference and they just say, hey, check this out.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.080]   Used to be.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.080]   How could you call them?
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.080]   He's an intentionally.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.320]   And you'd be on the phone with them at Apple and they'd say, don't ask me about that.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.480]   I can't talk about that.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.480]   They knew it was bugged.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.960]   Well, the emails that I get are from crazy.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.720]   I've never heard of domains that are offshore or whatever they may be and just look at the
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   signatory now.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.720]   Oh, okay.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.440]   You know, X57 has sent me three good rumors in the past.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.440]   You know?
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.440]   What about this?
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.440]   What about this China times?
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.000]   The rumor that Apple's buying touch screens, it looks like, I have to say, when you look
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.600]   at 3.0, it looks like Apple's getting ready for a tablet PC.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.360]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   You don't think so?
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.960]   No, I think their focus is on the iPhone right now and how they can evolve that.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.120]   I think there's a hardware update coming later this year for the iPhone.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   To match 3.0.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.840]   They're going to give away 3.0 to current users.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.840]   Right.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   But to match 3.0.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   Well, I think there's something to do.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.760]   It'll be a year on in August for iPhone 2, right?
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.240]   And it was a year between--
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.160]   Well, and here's the key in iPhone 1 and 2.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:10.200]   Scott Borne makes this very good point that this is two years since the original people
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.000]   bought their contract is now running out.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.680]   Time to get them in the fold if they're thinking of moving on to say a Palm Pre.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.160]   Is the Pre the competition?
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.920]   Gina, are you looking at a Pre?
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.720]   Is that like the next phone for you?
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.800]   I'm checking it out.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.920]   I just switched it to Android myself.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.640]   So I think I'm happy for now.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.640]   You're an Android user.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.640]   I am.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.640]   I'm an Android user.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:36.720]   You know, the iPhone 3.0 sounds awesome, but the 2.0 upgrade just completely screwed
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.720]   up my phone.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.160]   Like, the phone was never the same after that.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.160]   So while in theory, it sounds great.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.800]   I'm interested to see what it's really like.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.080]   I keep trying to use the G1.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.600]   I wanted to like the G1.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.120]   Yeah, you know, the G1, the handset kind of sucks.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.360]   Android is great.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.360]   It's the hardware.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.680]   The hardware is not powerful enough for Android.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   So there's lag.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.880]   Battery life is three hours, four hours.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.400]   The screen in the software looks clean.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.200]   I saw a Twitter app on the other day and I was like, wow, this is really like a computer
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   thing.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   But the battery life heard is cool.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.600]   I think we're going to see, and this is, I know nothing, but I think we're going to
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.560]   see netbooks on an Android platform.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.840]   I think it's just a natural, you know.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.200]   Do we think Steve Jobs is going to come back to Apple?
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.200]   I don't think so.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.480]   It depends on what his health problem really is.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.680]   It depends on if he kind of maintains his current health.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.160]   I think he'll stay retired and kind of just keep a chairman on the board kind of role
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.160]   thing going on.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.720]   Is he a chairman on the board?
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.720]   I think so, yes.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.880]   I think he's a chairman.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.080]   But if he obviously puts weight back on and gains his health back again, I think he'll
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.080]   come back.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.080]   But who knows?
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.080]   We don't, none of us should say none of us know, right?
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.080]   Yeah, none of us know.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.680]   Nobody's claiming any insight information.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:54.240]   I'm wondering what would be the major difference in an Apple without Steve Jobs because obviously
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.600]   it seems like it's changed already since he's done it.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   It does, doesn't it?
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   A month.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   It does.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.000]   And maybe it's coincidence since there's a long product cycle you can't say cut and
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.720]   paste is because he wasn't there.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.760]   That obviously was in the pipeline.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.720]   But it does feel like a different organization.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:14.080]   Maybe they will let you put any MP3 player into the, you know, iTunes.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.160]   Maybe they'll let you put any application and maybe they'll unlock the iPhone because
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.160]   that to me screams of a Steve Jobs.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:25.080]   Well, AT&T is selling an unlocked iPhone if you've got 700 bucks to lay for the 16 gig
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.960]   version and 500 bucks for the eight gig version.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.040]   I don't know who would buy that.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.200]   I don't know if they did that because of the FCC or what, but I just hope they put the
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.760]   right CEO in place.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.720]   I want to I was like, he's on.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.720]   Really?
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.720]   You think so more than a designer, you think he could run the place?
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.720]   See, I don't know why he's got the vision.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.720]   He's got the vision.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   Jonathan Ives, you've got no business experience.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.720]   He's a designer.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.720]   He's a great designer.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.720]   He's just got that sense.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.000]   I mean, unless he has a really good, good CEO, he's just a badass.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.480]   He's a badass like Jobs is.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   He's a visionary.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   There's no question.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   He's a product visionary without a doubt.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.880]   Well, if it wasn't for him, they wouldn't have half of the design of anybody.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.360]   He's responsible for anything.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.680]   Somebody like Tim Cook who comes along is clearly the business guy, the guy who can
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.080]   run it, but doesn't have that.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.080]   Make him a strong COO, make Ives the CEO.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.040]   That would be awesome.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.280]   Gina, who should run Apple?
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.280]   I don't know.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.840]   I'm going to go with Kevin on that.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.840]   Sure.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.840]   Kevin Rose.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.840]   Kevin Rose.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.840]   Kevin Rose.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.840]   Kevin Rose.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.840]   I go with that.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.840]   I'll go with that.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.240]   I think it'd be a good...
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.720]   Would you like a hardware jump?
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   That would be pretty badass.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.640]   If I could work with Ives, the hell yes.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.480]   Bill Campbell chairman of the Apple.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   According to the...
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   Campbell chairman of the board.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   Okay.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.480]   All right.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.480]   So Steve is just a CEO and board member.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.480]   All right, Kevin.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.480]   So here it is.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   If they came to you and said...
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.880]   One dollar, you get paid one dollar, but you get a jet.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.040]   Do I get that little stock option?
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.680]   You get the stock options in the jet.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.680]   There it is.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.680]   Here it is.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.960]   Dig keeps running your chairman, emeritus, whatever you're involved.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.760]   You could do Dig in a day or week.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:58.920]   And you become president of Apple, second only to the CEO and work in the new products
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.440]   group and they give you whatever.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.440]   Some huge amount of stuff.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.440]   Would you go do it?
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.800]   Would you leave Dig full time to go be president of Apple?
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   Yes or no?
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.960]   Why are you doing this to me, Jason?
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.960]   The problem is everything would leak like a...
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.960]   I want to see if you're on the ground.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.440]   Take what happens to Apple rumors.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.440]   Yeah, totally.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.800]   You could still do Dig Nation.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   It did.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   Great.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   It's Apple.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.800]   I don't know.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.800]   That's a tough call.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.680]   I think that we've got a Dig in our product roadmap.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.200]   We've got like another two years of really cool.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.200]   I want to see out there.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.680]   Do you see yourself segwaying in a couple of years to something else?
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   I don't know.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.600]   I mean, that's not a good thing to ask because you don't want to tell the troops that I'm
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.120]   here for a couple more years.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.800]   You want to say I'm here for the rest of my life.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:48.000]   I mean, the thing is that I believe and you'll see with the toolbar and then some releases
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.640]   shortly thereafter that we've got some crazy new directions for Dig that we've never taken
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.640]   in the past.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.720]   You look at the home page and you're like, "Oh, that's the same Dig I've known for the
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.720]   last few years, right?"
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.440]   You need to do that, don't you?
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.160]   You constantly have to keep swimming.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.160]   You constantly have to do that.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.160]   We've been around for four years.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.160]   People get bored.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.160]   Almost five, right?
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   When is it five?
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.160]   Almost five.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.160]   Wow.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.160]   It's nuts.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.160]   Right.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.160]   Crazy.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.360]   The fourth anniversary of me leaving tech TV.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.360]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.800]   Is it four or five?
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   Five.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.640]   It'll be five years as I left tech TV.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   It's been the whole day.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.640]   April 1, 2004.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.400]   We were on the DC and it was kind of cool.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.880]   When we were interviewing the chairman of the FCC, Michael Powell.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.680]   It was kind of cool to just be gone when the S hit the fan.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.240]   I remember telling Michael Powell.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   The S.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.240]   I don't know.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   The S is good.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.240]   That would be...
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.240]   The S hit the fan.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.240]   Right.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.240]   The S hit the fan.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.240]   How?
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   Fan ass.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   The chairman of the FCC.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:45.000]   And this guy loved tech TV and I said, "Yeah, I think it's over for tech TV."
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.040]   And he was genuinely like, "Oh, that's terrible."
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.240]   Yeah, a lot of people were bummed.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.240]   It's very sad.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.120]   I want to take another break when we come back.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.920]   Do I need my credit card for this one?
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:56.920]   Yes.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.920]   When we...
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.480]   I'm trying to think.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   When we come back...
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.480]   I had something I wanted to talk to you guys about.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.080]   Well, it'll come back to me.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.320]   I want to talk about how I didn't block you and we follow.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.400]   I know you didn't.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   I didn't block you.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   Twitter did it.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.400]   Twitter didn't block you either.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   This search TV is still...
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.400]   This is sucky.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.640]   It's just...
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   I don't know.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.640]   I'm not sure I trust Ev.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   I don't think you have likes.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.640]   I don't think you have likes me.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.640]   What?
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   How do you get that?
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   He doesn't like me.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.640]   I don't want to get into this.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   People don't like it when I whine.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.640]   No more like...
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.400]   Oh, you're not on the suggestions followers as I answer, I see.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.160]   Do you talk to Evavee and I'm on the show?
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.560]   We talked to him when Twitter first started.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.560]   You should have him on the show.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.560]   We've asked him to be back.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.560]   And he said no.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   I'll get him on the show.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.920]   People that wouldn't be on Twitter at the same time as other people.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.440]   Oh, there's a lot of those.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.440]   Really?
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.440]   That's just basically with me.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.440]   That's the only one you'll be on with Jason.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.600]   Kevin's sitting here, so he's not one of them.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.200]   The only person who will be on me is Corey Doctorow.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.520]   Corey is not the only one, but yes, Corey's one.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.680]   No, that's not true.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.400]   John Dvorak is on him all the time.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.600]   John would do it, but he's not crazy about it.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.880]   That's because I challenge John.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.880]   You challenge him.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   He doesn't like to be challenged.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.680]   Jason, Jason is challenging.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.680]   That's a good thing.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.600]   Gina, I think you need to have a writer in your contract that says who you won't be
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:20.200]   on with, what kind of M&Ms you want, that kind of thing.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.920]   What's your writer, Gina?
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   What is the showstopper?
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.920]   What is the thing?
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:29.320]   The one thing with which I will up with, which I will not put.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.840]   Well, I definitely need to dark chocolate M&Ms.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.560]   I think dark chocolate M&Ms are definitely there.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.120]   It was a pretty tight, pretty tight.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.120]   I didn't know they made them.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.120]   Where do you get those?
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.120]   Oh, they're good.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.120]   Okay, okay.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.120]   Here's what you're going to do.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.120]   Dark chocolate M&Ms.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   You put them in the microwave 30 seconds on high, okay?
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.520]   Until they like the shells crack.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.880]   My friend Troy Malone told me this.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.480]   The shell kind of cracks a little bit and starts to sweat.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   She's perfect.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   She's like a cacken.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.240]   She's like a microwave and they're delicious.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.960]   I'm all about the M&Ms.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:56.960]   Microwaved on high.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   Wow.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   30 seconds.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   We try it.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   Have any M&Ms here, Leo?
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.960]   We'll run out.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.760]   Colin is going to run out and get some M&Ms.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   That's Prager.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   Set Prager.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   No, no, Prager's.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   Prager's been a lot.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.760]   Prager's no longer the girlfriend.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.760]   He's your valet, right?
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   I'm just Kevin's driver.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.760]   He's the valet.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   He's in the turtle.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.760]   He's wearing a backwards baseball hat.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.760]   I'm the one jumping.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   Oh, no.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.760]   That's horrible.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.760]   We can get you a set on that.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.760]   I think Kevin needs a refresh on his teeth, Prager.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   I do actually.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.760]   I do actually.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   I do actually.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   No, no, no.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.760]   We got, that's why you have the Prager.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.760]   Colin's running out to do that.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.160]   Did you see though what Skittles did?
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.760]   Skittles put a Twitter stream on their front page?
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.760]   No.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.760]   Everybody was like swearing.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.760]   I got Twitter in my blind.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.760]   It was worth it for them to do that.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   I saw that as a trending topic.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.760]   I was like, why is Skittles so hot right now?
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   So now they put Facebook there.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   It's not a Twitter.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   They take the Twitter out.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.760]   People were gaming it.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.760]   We had a break.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.760]   Who owns the break?
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.760]   This is a break.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   If you would like to drink some Pepsi One or?
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   Pepsi, no.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.760]   Diet Coke.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   Diet Coke.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   Coke Zero.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.680]   There's no reason to drink it.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   It's got nothing in it.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.760]   This part of the show is, and they're, boy, are they sorry, brought to you by GoToMyPC.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   My friends go to MyPC.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.680]   From the folks at Citrix.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   Yes.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   Yes, Jason.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.600]   No, I go to MyPC is how I did all the interviews for TechCrunch 50.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.640]   I did about 100 of those in a week on GoToMyPC.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.760]   You probably had your choice of any remote access program, but no, you chose GoToMyPC
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.800]   because GoToMyPC from Citrix is secure.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   It's fast.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.160]   You don't have to get to figure the router.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.320]   It doesn't, what's called, Nat traversal.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.760]   There really is no better way to get out of the office, to go on vacation, to travel,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.280]   and still have access to your office system.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.840]   In fact, you could put it on there right now.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.760]   Go to GoToMyPC.com/twit.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.240]   Go to MyPC.com/tripp before I'm done talking.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.880]   It will be installed with no special configuration.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.160]   Now, the minute you go somewhere, you just log on with a Mac or PC, any computer, you
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.640]   log on to GoToMyPC.com.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.440]   Here's your office computer, full screen, just like you're there.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.720]   Run any program, send and receive email, access any network resource.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:11.160]   It is remote access done right, simple, powerful, secure too, by the way.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.880]   Use this as a VPN if you want.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.720]   When you're at an internet cafe, you go to GoToMyPC.com and you're...
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.360]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.960]   PC World's World Class Award for Best Remote Access Software again, and now it's free.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.360]   For the next 30 days, go to GoToMyPC.com/twit.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   Go to MyPC.com/twit.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.360]   Thank you.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.360]   Do I need a credit card or just to sign up with them?
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.360]   Yeah, you need a credit card on this one.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.200]   Well, it doesn't have to be a black card.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   It could be any card.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.360]   Any color at all.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   They're not proud.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   You do a trial.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.360]   For a trial.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.280]   This is for a one month free trial.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.720]   They're not going to charge a card, but they just need that because you know what happens?
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   What's that?
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.520]   There are bad people out there who just keep signing up for the free trial over and over
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.520]   and over again.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:00.120]   So they want to kind of limit it to the number of credit cards you have.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.320]   Kevin, you do a press tour when you have a new product out.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.520]   You do like a little press tour and show it to some of the press before you launch it.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.280]   A little satellite media tour.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:12.560]   It depends on how big the product is, but normally it's just like a blogger tour, kind
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:16.080]   of call up Harrington and a few others and say, "Hey, we've got this coming out in a
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.080]   few weeks.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.080]   You want to take a look."
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.360]   And you go to have to pop it with them?
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.360]   Totally.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.360]   It's high to do it, but you do it with the guys in New York too, and they really appreciate
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.360]   it.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:29.400]   You get the LA Times and you just get to go to my ABC.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.400]   And boom.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.320]   Yeah, Mr. Dan Patterson at ABC News lacked no more.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.880]   So I could use GoToMyPC for that.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.240]   If you were doing a press tour, you know, because I know Kevin--
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.240]   Actually, you would probably just go to a meeting for that.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.240]   Go to me and that's what I said.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.280]   Is there a free trial that I could use?
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.720]   There is GoToMeDies.com/twit.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.720]   Same thing.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.720]   There's no risk for trial too, right?
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.880]   Take a two for the price of one on that one.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.880]   Wow.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.880]   All right, you guys.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:53.880]   I love when they say no risk for trial.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.680]   I've never been to the trial where it's like a risky trial.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.160]   You know, I have a sponsor on the radio where I can't say free trial.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.800]   I'm not going to say the sponsor, but I can't say free trial, but I can say no risk trial.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   Huh.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.120]   I think the risk is where you sign up for a free trial and you have to actively remember
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.120]   to cancel otherwise--
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.120]   That's the risk.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.120]   --you can do any trial.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.120]   That's the risk.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.120]   Ah, that's the risk trial.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   That's the clever--
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.880]   There's weird things you can sign up for if you really can't get a benefit.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.480]   Like your Twit donation, which will continue forever unless you cancel it.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   Just a reminder.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:30.840]   You know, we stopped doing yearly donations because every year we get a message from somebody
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.120]   saying, "What's this charge?"
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.240]   And I have to say, you signed up for yearly donation.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.240]   So I just said--
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.240]   Or monthly, I mean.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   Monthly people remember because they see it every month.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   What's the average $5 or $2?
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   Two dollars.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.600]   I asked for $2 a month to figure that's as cheap as you can get.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   And--
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   See, we stopped doing it.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   We stopped--
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   You don't do that anymore.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.240]   We kind of are thinking about having quote unquote paid memberships again, but trying to
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.400]   wrap my head around what to offer.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   We don't offer anything.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.880]   We don't offer anything.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   I mean--
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.000]   Oh, you just have a-- do after-dignation.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.440]   So you have Alex and Kevin and you talking about the show for--
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:06.360]   But you know what happens when you do that?
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.760]   And this happened to you guys too.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.960]   You gave people early access and then they just distribute it.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.960]   They kind of-- they break it.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.440]   And the content's free and the only reason--
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:16.360]   And then you have to start chasing them around, like whack them all.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.520]   To count it, like the same way as you want to be able to--
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.520]   You don't want to get in that business.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.160]   How many people are watching Twitter?
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.600]   A donation to Twitter is because you like what you hear.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.280]   It's free if you want to support it.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.440]   There's another reason to do it more than-- I mean, the money's--
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.440]   The NPR.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.680]   Well, the money-- yeah, it's like NPR.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.680]   The money does, believe it or not.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.440]   I mean, we wouldn't be here because for the first two years we didn't have sponsors.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.640]   There's a light saber.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.640]   There's a lightsaber.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.480]   Who's got a lightsaber?
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.240]   Which of them losers is a lightsaber?
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.240]   Oh, Jason.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.240]   Jason.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.240]   Put it away.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.240]   Sorry about that.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.240]   I didn't realize I was like--
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.840]   Oh, listen to that sound.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.840]   That's very authentic.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.840]   Now, somebody walked into my office and asked for a raise.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.440]   So whenever they do that, I put the lightsaber on.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.040]   You are asking for a raise, eh?
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:00.240]   I find your lack of faith in your stock options disturbing.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.880]   That's good.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.360]   You can use that, Kevin.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.160]   Next time, Prager asks for a raise.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.000]   You tell him your stock options are your raise.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.240]   And Jay Allison will be less forgiving than me.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:18.360]   I never forget my valuable tech TV stock options.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.360]   Oh, yes.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.320]   We're using upstairs in the bathroom.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.640]   Were people suing Paul Allen about that?
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.640]   Like, you know what I was saying?
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:29.160]   No, we went to a lawyer and we investigated, and there was no way out.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:34.320]   I heard a story from an unnamed source that they would have these meetings with Paul Allen
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.120]   at Tech TV.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:39.280]   And they'd have to retell him everything that they told him the first time around.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.880]   And he wouldn't remember.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.120]   And at one point, Paul Allen stood up.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.240]   And he held his wallet out of his pocket.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.120]   And he held it up at this person who I shouldn't name.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.320]   And he says, see this?
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.320]   It's getting thinner.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.320]   I know.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:56.640]   I wish that if something like that had ever been like on a YouTube video, it would have
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.400]   gone so viral.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.400]   Wow.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.400]   That's like--
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   He's going to be a series of bad investments in the past, right?
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.160]   Oh, in the past, the president's charter is now in trouble.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.920]   I think charter declared chapter 11.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.200]   It doesn't really matter, though.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.040]   I mean, he's got like a few Billy in the bank.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.040]   Like, what does he care?
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.520]   All you've got to do is take likes-- and you should remember this.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.720]   Let's skim just a little off the top every month.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.880]   Put that aside.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.960]   And you never have to worry again.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   Where were we?
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.640]   Do we want to talk any more about the Apple III?
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   I don't think so.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.640]   Talk about flip.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.640]   Flip.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.640]   I think that was a good idea.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:33.040]   Why does Cisco buy a portable camera manufacturer?
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.320]   Because they want to be able to sell consumer devices, then they started to do it for a
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.320]   little bit like this.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.320]   They own links this.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.320]   And I think--
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.320]   But how does this fit the product line?
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.560]   Well, I think it's an enormous opportunity.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.560]   They have deeper pockets.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:47.200]   They can spend more money in R&D of engineering and hardware devices.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.080]   And I think there's a burgeoning market for small personal video recording devices.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.120]   I think it's really interesting that both of you guys walk in with a flip camera, I
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   think, is really.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.120]   And then Jason showed the whole thing.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.120]   We didn't even plan on that either.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:00.520]   And I think more and more people are going to be able to have a video camera that basically
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.640]   fits in your pocket.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   Seriously.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   And I think Cisco--
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   But wait a minute.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   We shouldn't be on the phone.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.360]   Yeah, but it brings the batteries so fast on the iPhone.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.360]   Well, I mean, any videos.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:15.520]   And again, Cisco is in a position where they could decide we want to make a flip cam that
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:18.320]   has network access.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.280]   We want to make a flip cam that does this or something else.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.280]   Hey, Leo.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.000]   Can I introduce your friend?
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.360]   This is my friend, Sam Levine, if you've ever seen "Freeks and Geeks."
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.920]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.160]   I love that show.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:34.160]   And he's an Inglorious bastard.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   If you know Quentin Tarantino's new film, he plays a Nazi killing mofo.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   Yes.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.760]   I believe that's how it's written in the script, Nazi killing mofo.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.760]   Nice to meet you.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.960]   What was the like to work with Quentin Tarantino?
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.320]   It was the craziest experience of my life.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.640]   iPhone or Blackberry?
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.040]   iPhone all the way.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.040]   OK.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.040]   Macro PC.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.040]   Oh, oh.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.040]   Split decision.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.040]   Split down the middle there.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.040]   All right.
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.040]   We'll talk to you soon.
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.040]   All right.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.040]   He's the guest on-- that was a little promo.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.040]   He's the guest on "Cavon Pollock."
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.040]   Shall we do a little cross-pollination?
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.040]   Sorry about that, Leo.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040]   Cross-pollockization.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.040]   And there's the question.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040]   Cross-pollockization.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040]   You ask anyone.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.360]   No, "Freeks and Geeks" was an amazing show.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.200]   You know all the people who came out Seth Rogen.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.160]   So many people came out of that show.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.160]   And that's great.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160]   It's great to see him.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.800]   Sam Levine made a lot of money at the poker game last night.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.800]   How much did you--
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.800]   Best legal report.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.800]   They still have many huge fans since--
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.800]   Sam says--
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.800]   TV.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   Huge fans and ZDTV.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.000]   Did you tell him Kevin Rose was in here too, speaking of--
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   You know Kevin Rose--
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   Big?
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   He's in there too.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   Oh, really?
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   He loves you, Kevin Rose.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   Oh, I tell him I said thank you.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   I'm a fan.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   Yo.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   Yo.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.640]   Sam wants to know how he can get on the Twitter top followers list.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.960]   He's only got like 2,000--
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.480]   Sure what I'd like to know that.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.320]   What is his Twitter handle?
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.320]   It's S-A-M-M Levine.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320]   Right to Adamself till we follow.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.200]   Yeah, that's actually a good start.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.200]   Go to wefollow.com.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.760]   You got to go to wefollow.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   The problem is if you only--
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.760]   Now this is a flaw in wefollow.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.680]   If you only have 2,000 followers, there's so many people going to be show up ahead of
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680]   you.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.680]   You rank by followers.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680]   You can't believe it.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   Yeah, well I mean you put--
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:16.240]   We have really crazy-- like if you go to like tag slash, I mean everything from feminist
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.240]   to tea to--
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.240]   But people are looking--
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.240]   Hasters.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.120]   So people, they're going to look at actors, right?
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.120]   Because he's an actor.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.280]   And he's going to be like 800 on the list.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.280]   He'll probably be in the top 50, it's--
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.280]   Really?
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.280]   Well, how many followers does he have?
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.280]   2,000.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.440]   Oh crap, we just took down we follow again.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.440]   Oh, sorry.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.440]   It's okay.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440]   We only have two servers.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:39.160]   And everybody, to retweet, to follow Sam Levine.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.160]   So he gets a name.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.160]   S-A-M-M-L-E-V-I-N-E.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.160]   Is that how he spells it?
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.480]   Yeah, L-E-V-I-N-E.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.480]   Everyone follow him.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.480]   And why should we follow?
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.480]   Because he's funny, because he's cute.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   He's pretty funny.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.480]   He's a cute guy.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   He's single for the ladies out there.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.480]   For the ladies.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.080]   He's a simple man who likes simple things for--
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.080]   For Gina.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.680]   --fancy cars and casinos, according to Twitter.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.320]   Fancy cars and casinos?
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.320]   But he's a juvenile.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.320]   And he plays juveniles.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.320]   He looks like he's 12.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320]   But he's a man.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   He's a boy in a man's body, a man in a boy's body.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.880]   Anyway, he kills a lot of Nazis in his entire country.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.600]   He's a mean mofo.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.600]   Yes.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.600]   Yes.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:23.240]   So your offer now to Twitter to be on the top list, you should tell Sam this, is now
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.240]   up to half a million dollars.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.240]   Yes, it is.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.600]   Jason moved it up to half a million dollars.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.160]   Are you really going to pay half a million bucks?
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.880]   I said, if I was a default user for three years, I would pay--
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.480]   You want three years for his money now?
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.480]   I said three years.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.600]   I keep upping it because I want to keep changing the deal so it's better for me.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.680]   So three years, which means you would get how many people are they going to add in the
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.920]   next three years, Kevin?
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   Right.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920]   I get you.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920]   Right now, yeah.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920]   How many--
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920]   How many--
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   Yes, how many do you think?
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920]   In the next three years?
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.920]   20 million?
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:55.920]   No more than that.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.920]   50 million?
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.920]   More than that.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   They're going to be 175 million.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   They're going to be like Facebook?
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   They'll probably be Facebook size in three years.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:01.920]   All right.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   So what's the range, Kevin?
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.360]   Worst case scenario, what?
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.560]   And top line, what?
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.760]   You're probably in three years.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.640]   You're probably going to pick up maybe five to seven million followers.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.800]   If that list stayed static at that, you know, four year, 45?
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.800]   Well, no, no.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.280]   80% of people add those people.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.280]   It is.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.960]   That's what you look at.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.440]   It's 10,000 a day for people.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.440]   No, no.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.440]   What's doing is--
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.440]   Yeah, but really, do you think that that's going to stay that way?
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.440]   I can't imagine it is.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.440]   I'm just going to keep it a static list.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.720]   What it's doing is that they select the first 25 and then they randomize that list of
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.720]   suggested people.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.040]   So they go through-- if you refresh the page, it'll show a different 25.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040]   And so they're going through that.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.280]   Yeah, except that for some reason, all foods is always on there and Dell is always on there.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.480]   What does Whole Foods talk about?
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.280]   You get about a third of the people who find it.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.200]   Do you think new users at Twitter really should be following Whole Foods?
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.200]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.200]   I don't know how to--
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.040]   I want to use it.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040]   I mean, it's like--
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.040]   It's like--
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.840]   It's Whole Foods paying for it?
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.000]   No, nobody's paying anything now.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.480]   Do we know that for sure though?
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.480]   I know it for a fact.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.480]   Nobody's paying anybody anything.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.480]   No, no.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.480]   Right turn down your half a million.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:12.720]   Well, Jason, I have friends, Evan, and I did this as sort of a half of a joke and half
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.960]   serious because they didn't include me in the top whatever list when they did it.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.560]   So I went from being like number five to number 50.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.120]   Can I ask you a question?
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.360]   Were you supposed to microwave the M&Ms inside the bag?
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360]   Are they miked in the bag?
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.360]   No, no.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.000]   You had to put them all down.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.840]   She microwaved them in the bag.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.840]   Is that all that crazy steam chamber M&Ms?
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.720]   We're now going to have a lump-- well, we got another one.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.160]   Okay, are these microwaved?
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.520]   Okay, take them out.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.680]   Put them on-- she likes hacking stuff.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.320]   So these are microwave 30 seconds.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.680]   All right, so that's the entire bag, microwave?
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.680]   The entire bag?
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.680]   What do you think, Jason?
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.680]   So what's the inside look like?
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.680]   Check out.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.680]   Let's open it up and see.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.680]   I don't know.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.680]   So what's supposed to happen, Gina?
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.680]   They're supposed to glow?
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.800]   Well, they're just supposed to melt on the inside and, you know, make you feel--
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.560]   No, I think this might have worked.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.560]   There's a few broken ones.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.560]   Are they still together?
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.560]   Are they still together?
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.560]   Are they still together?
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.560]   Go ahead, David.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.560]   You get to try it.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.560]   We did the bag melt to the M&Ms, though.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.560]   No.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.560]   The bag is intact.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.560]   All right, I'm going to try it.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.560]   I'm going to try it.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   If it tastes like--
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560]   Oh, you're right.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.560]   No, mmm.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.560]   Yeah, right.
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.560]   So you get a creamy middle.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.560]   Uh-huh.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.560]   Because the chocolate is slightly melted.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.560]   Exactly.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   And then you get the hard shell exterior.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.560]   And they still melt in your mouth, not in your hands.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.560]   That's pretty accurate.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.560]   Have you done this with skittles?
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.560]   I haven't.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.560]   Well, you have a bag of skittles, too.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560]   We should try it.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.480]   You can't be out of fuel onto an Appian if you're afraid of the ink from the bag leaching
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.560]   into your chocolate, which might not be so bad.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   Yeah, no, I don't think that's a good idea.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.560]   So we're going to put these on the-- what is the difference in skittles and M&Ms?
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.560]   Well, there's no chocolate involved.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.560]   See, that concerns me a little.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.560]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.560]   So there's like a jelly bean in there, huh?
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.560]   It's like--
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.560]   It might-- it's like--
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.560]   You never know.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.560]   --start a burst with a candy coating.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.560]   There we go.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.560]   Okay.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.560]   And then 30 seconds on the skittle.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.560]   What's this?
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.560]   Oh, look.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.560]   These are microwaved in a mug, apparently.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.560]   They get a little melty, the M&Ms, as you're probably seeing.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.560]   I'm sticking with the lint 70% cocoa and 10-stark chocolate.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.560]   Forget M&Ms.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.560]   Well, look at this.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560]   I really love that lint.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560]   The lint is delicious.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.560]   Look at that lint is good stuff.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.560]   Cargo playing crashes in Tokyo, and they've got a video of it.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.560]   Oh, my God.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.560]   Wow.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.560]   Is there a plane there?
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560]   Well, planes stop crashing.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.560]   Holy hell.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.560]   We've had so many in the last.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:27.560]   Now, many people don't know this, but Kevin is not exactly a good flyer.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.560]   No, I love to fly as long as I've had like three or four beers before.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.560]   You're a nervous flyer a little bit.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.560]   I know this because we couldn't--
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.560]   Wait, I didn't plan--
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560]   --prech it to come back to Toronto, because you didn't like the flying.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.560]   I hate the whole-- I hate everything about it.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:40.560]   It's pretty--
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.560]   --because it's going to wait and like it's like--
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.560]   Yeah, it's off.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560]   Yeah, but you were live streaming your flight last week.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.560]   That's true.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.560]   That was fun.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560]   Actually, that's on Virgin America.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560]   He was sitting there with a--
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560]   Was it you stream or something else?
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.560]   Yeah, you stream.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.560]   And everyone just sitting there staring at him, staring at his computer.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.560]   All right, now we've microwave Skittles.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560]   While you did enjoy these--
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.560]   Let's try one of these too.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560]   Come on.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.560]   The green.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.560]   You know the green do.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.560]   Oh, you know those are good.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.560]   What do the green do?
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560]   Do you remember when--
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.560]   Let's stop it.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.560]   Leo, how many of those tech TV shirts do you own?
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.560]   Oh, I wore this for today for the occasion.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   I have three or four.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.560]   They don't make them anymore, you know.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.560]   Oh, wow.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.560]   That's really different.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.560]   Skittles.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.560]   They're good.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.560]   It's not bad.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560]   It's not bad.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.560]   It's not bad.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.560]   Mm.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   All right.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.560]   Technology news.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   I'm sure there's some.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.560]   TV viewing, according to Nielsen, is it an all time high?
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.560]   It's because the more people are watching TV, well, this is from the fall.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.560]   So maybe the election, it's something to do with it.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.560]   More people are watching TV than ever before.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.560]   The average American television-- I thought it was going down.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.560]   No, I can tell you what's going up.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.560]   Get this.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:47.560]   The average American television viewer is watching more than 151 hours of television a month.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.560]   That's five hours a day.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.560]   It's very simple reason.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.560]   Oh.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.560]   Why?
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.560]   Because people used to miss episodes of shows.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:04.560]   So to get into a show like "damages" or "Battle Star" or "Lost" you would miss a show and you'd be like, "Ah, I'm not going to start that up."
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:12.560]   So now they can make shows that are totally big story arcs, very complex and know that people are not going to miss anything.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.560]   And if they do, they go to Hulu.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.560]   So now people are getting addicted.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:20.560]   I mean, I don't remember the last time in the '80s or '90s that people were like, "Oh my God, Battle Star.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.560]   Oh my God, damages. Oh my God, the shield.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.560]   Oh my God, lost."
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.560]   I mean, people are addicted to these shows and it's cliffhangers again, like the cereals.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.560]   So it's a renaissance for them if they only had the, you know--
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.560]   This is bad for us though for Region 3 and Twit because we don't want them watching so much TV.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.560]   No, no, that'd be fine.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.560]   Kevin's--
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560]   You don't care.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.560]   You can always find an hour here or there to fit in some good stuff.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.560]   They're doing some good podcasting.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.560]   They're different types of content.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.560]   Well, I do think one of the changes is that they're counting DVRs now.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.560]   They didn't--
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.560]   You know, when we were on tech TV, 13% of our audience was watching on Tivo and didn't get counted.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.560]   If you got a Tivo, Nielsen would come and take your people meter.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.560]   So that really hurt us because we never--
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.560]   You know, most of our audience was technically illiterate.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.560]   But now they're finally counting DVRs.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:15.560]   In fact, DVR viewer, the rise-- the use of recorders has gone up.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.560]   Now get this.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.560]   In the fourth quarter of 2008, 73.9 million people use DVRs.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:25.560]   I mean, how many-- there's only like 100 TV-- 100 million TV households total.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.560]   It's like three quarters of all households are using DVRs now.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.560]   That's not--
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.560]   But that's what you said, Jason, because you don't miss episodes anymore.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.560]   And if it gets to-- I mean, the big issue-- now it's like, oh, if I got the leader off the DVR by accident
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.560]   because I ran out of space or somebody actually deleted, I go to Hulu and watch it.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.560]   Right.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.560]   Or BitTorrent.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.560]   But what they're going to do is they're going to get us addicted to this.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:51.560]   And then the new inside line is, when you go to Hulu, maybe in like it'll take a year or two,
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.560]   you're going to have to prove that you subscribe at home.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.560]   Well, that's what they do with the HBO pay per view or--
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.560]   That's going to be for everything.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   How do they verify that?
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.560]   He's putting your address in--
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.560]   You put it in your address.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.560]   You put it in your view.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.560]   They cookie you.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.560]   They give you a login.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.560]   It's like serious satellite does.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.560]   Interesting.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.560]   This is the chocolate episode, huh?
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.560]   Oh, it was either wine or chocolate.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.560]   And since you declined our wine--
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.560]   Awesome.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.560]   Squarespace, by the way, who does your blog, right?
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:17.560]   Mm-hmm.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.560]   Senes--
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.560]   They do mine, too.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.560]   They do, Dan.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.560]   Yeah, they're--
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.560]   They send us some of the best wine.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.560]   They send us-- thank you.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:27.560]   I want to say thank you to Dane, who sent us like 10 bottles of like really good French wine.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.560]   I know.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.560]   And California, too.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.560]   You know, I had a chance to sit down with the Squarespace guys when we were in--
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.560]   South by Southwest.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:43.560]   And not only are they really engaged in making a fun and interesting platform, but they're
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:52.560]   intellectually engaged in how people use websites both on a user back end and how front end
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.560]   users navigate websites.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:02.560]   And they have, you know, a sincere intellectual fascination with not our toys and gizmos, but
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:08.320]   how do we move from a tinker type of platform like WordPress over to something that allows
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.240]   you to have that same code level access, but really concentrate on publishing as opposed
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.240]   to tinkering.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.600]   And, you know, they're fascinating guys.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.200]   I think you have to be smart now.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:24.160]   You cannot come out with a product, widgets or websites, and not really be-- you have
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.080]   to be Steve Jobs from now on.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.680]   The bar is rising.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.680]   And don't you--
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.680]   Like what way?
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680]   Like what?
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680]   Keep thinker.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.960]   I don't think you can just say, let's put some out and see what happens.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.880]   You know, Leah, one of the things that I constantly tell people within ABC and set the same talking
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.040]   point over and over and over at South by Southwest was that, look, our tools and our gadgets
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.800]   and gizmos, they're all well and good, but really this is not about our tools and gadgets.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:56.080]   It's about determining the way media and information flows in the 21st century.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.320]   And it's not obvious because it's changing.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.320]   We're in an inflection point.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.320]   Exactly.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:06.760]   But I keep telling my bosses, look, this is the democratization of the dissemination of
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.760]   information and you need to understand not just how Twitter works.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.960]   You need to not understand just how Facebook works, but you need to understand things like
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.240]   trust and community and relationship.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:24.200]   And they sound very, very basic, but all of information flows based on hierarchies of
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.720]   trust and relationships.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.880]   And if you don't understand that, you can implement any type of toy or gadget over the
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.360]   top of a website.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:36.200]   And like you said, you can't just launch it.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.240]   It has to be something that's smart and treats people like they're smart.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.520]   Does that make sense, Gina?
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.440]   You think that we're getting smarter?
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.440]   Absolutely.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440]   Absolutely.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.440]   Well, I hope we're getting smarter.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440]   Some people are getting smarter, but yeah, to build something meaningful.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.440]   Yes.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.160]   All of you have to understand all of those things.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.640]   Your site is smarter where.org.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.000]   And that was not an intentional plug.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   But thank you, Leo.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   I appreciate that.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.800]   One of the things that I see, though, that troubles me a little bit, especially when
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:07.080]   working with big companies and corporations, is that they oftentimes sit back and they
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.480]   just sit on their hands for a little bit and they kind of watch what's going on, but they're
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.240]   scared to get out there and actually play.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.840]   Because their business model is shaky, right?
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.400]   But you have to get out there.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.560]   You have to release early, release often and hear it, you know, and that's something that
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.640]   these big companies aren't used to doing.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.920]   Well, and they also don't understand what's going on because it undermines their business
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.920]   model.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.920]   And it's very difficult.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.280]   If you've built a company on one business model, well, Jason, can you speak to that?
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.720]   I mean, if now who's there?
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.160]   Oh, this is my friend Kevin Pollack.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.160]   Oh my God.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.160]   It's like Holly.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.640]   I'm just I'm just name-dropping.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.240]   Like Martin Short calling to the show yesterday.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.240]   Martin Short called it.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.240]   Hold on.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.240]   He'll talk to Kevin Pollack for a second.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.240]   He's more interesting.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.240]   I don't know.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.240]   I mean, I'm in the helm.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.400]   Kevin, you take the con.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   Take her out, Mr. P.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:03.240]   I'm only saying that because it's Shatner's 78th birthday today.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.640]   And I'm very excited and happy birthday to him.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:14.040]   We're glad to have you on board the Starship Enterprise, Mr. Shatner.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.040]   What do you think?
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.560]   What do you think, William, of the new Star Trek episode?
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560]   Oh, geez.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.560]   There's the new model.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.560]   First of all, let me just say.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.640]   Oh my God.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.680]   On the Star Trek celebration, it's Shatner's 78th birthday.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.680]   Jody in the house as well.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.680]   Shatner is 78th.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.680]   78th.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   78th.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.040]   Still kicking live square in the nuts.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.040]   He looks so good.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.040]   Yes, he do.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.040]   He's so good thinking.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.040]   Look at this.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.040]   We both got the hats.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.040]   This is going to be great.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.040]   I got mine.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.040]   Where's my cap?
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:45.040]   Is that because you guys are bald or is it just you like to wear the hat?
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.040]   You think it looks good on you.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:50.480]   Well, in him, in his case, it looks because he looks cool in my case because I am yet
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.280]   another talented balding Jew.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:00.360]   Now you know we're live very soon shortly after you and I hope we get one-tenth of your
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.360]   audience would be nice.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.920]   We're going to keep everybody and then some.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.400]   We're going to 60,000 to watch Kevin Pollock.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   Vamp.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400]   Live.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.400]   What is the name of this?
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.360]   Is it the Kevin Pollock Show?
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.520]   It's called Kevin Pollock's Chat Show.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.680]   And it's very original.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.120]   Kevin Pollock's Chat Show dot com.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:23.240]   One of the many portals where this can be viewed.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:29.880]   And Lvar Bert and Sam Levine, the first guest on the first kickoff debut show in T-37.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.520]   I'd better start drinking.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.880]   Yeah, you better start getting licked up now, Lvar.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.840]   And I want you, by the way, but you have to promise now on your show live that you'll
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.040]   be a guest on mine and Kevin Rose as well, please.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.200]   I think the awesome.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.560]   Anytime we'd love to do that.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.560]   Absolutely.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.560]   I'm going to book you now.
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.560]   I'm not going to just take any time.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.560]   Thursday at four.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.560]   I'll be there.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.800]   No, it's Sunday every Sunday, 5 p.m.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.800]   You're Pacific.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.160]   Have your person, Mr. Callicanis, have him call my person.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.120]   I will have my bitch.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:05.960]   Callicanis call your people and we'll set this up.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.360]   And by the way, bitches the new King of the world, just so you know.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.840]   It's great to talk to you, Kevin.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.240]   I'm a huge fan.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.240]   I don't know if you remember.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:19.960]   I used to have you on the radio show on K&BR in San Francisco often and just a big fan of
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.000]   all the success you've had.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   Thank you very much.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.760]   And of course I remember it's still on my resume.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.440]   No, you don't know if that's a good thing.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.440]   I do.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.440]   Go do your show.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.440]   Go do this show.
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.440]   Thank you.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.440]   Thank you very much.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.200]   I look forward to being on your show and you on my show and Kevin Rose.
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.200]   Deal.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.200]   Please.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.440]   Ask LaVarr what it was like to be on this show and then say you want to be on it.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440]   Oh, OK.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.440]   I will.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.440]   I'll put that to him live.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.880]   And we're taking live questions as well.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.600]   So please offer some of those and now here's Mr. Callicanis, my boss.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.160]   It's like Bob Hope wandering into the studio.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.400]   You wouldn't remember that.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400]   You too.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.400]   I remember Bob Hope.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.400]   You remember Bob?
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   But I mean, you don't remember him.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   Do you remember?
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400]   Did you ever watch Johnny Carson?
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.400]   You did.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400]   OK.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400]   So you were pretty young.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.400]   So Jason, I was asking the question.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.400]   I would.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.400]   I forgot now what I was asking was something about business.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   Oh, well.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.400]   Changing business models.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.400]   I don't remember.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400]   Which business model would change?
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.600]   Just how difficult it is for a company that is built around one business model to suddenly
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.280]   say, oh, look at these newspapers.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.200]   This week, Seattle Post Intelligence, sir.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.200]   It's gone online.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.200]   It's no longer a print paper.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.720]   I think that's a difficult transition because their whole business is built on display ads,
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.560]   full pages, display ads, and classified ads, neither of which exist on the internet.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.560]   No way they saw that coming, huh?
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.560]   So it's a very difficult transit.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.720]   I, it's my same thing with the record industry.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:43.160]   It's going to be very difficult when you build a business and the entire business is
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.040]   positive on one particular business plan.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.400]   I think it's got to be tough to say, well, it's different now.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.080]   It's brutally tough because typically it would involve a different group of people
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.920]   with a different set of DNA.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:18:02.040]   I mean, if Dig went to an editorial basis and they picked a content store for it by editors,
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.960]   you would be like, oh, well, what do we do with all these people who are community managers
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:05.960]   and developers?
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.960]   Right.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.800]   And that's, you know, what's going to have to happen with newspapers and a lot of things.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:15.480]   And most of the times people can't make the evolutionary shift.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.560]   It's just too difficult.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.280]   You better have just shut some of these things down.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.400]   And, and you know what, don't cry for the newspapers.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.280]   It's an opportunity for young people with new ideas to make better things than newspapers,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:30.000]   which frankly, a lot of them were bought and sold and their editorial was very biased
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.600]   and their ideas were very old.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.120]   Don't cry for the newspaper business.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:40.240]   I'm sick of that, you know, in, in gadget as a blog or, you know, this week in tech
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:46.400]   as a show are much better life hacker, et cetera, than the tech products that came before
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.400]   them.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   They're better than ZDnet.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   They're better than Cnet.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.880]   They're better than PC magazine.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.520]   Nobody's crying because G4 TV is gone.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.520]   Who cares?
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.920]   Who gives a crap about tech TV?
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.160]   Twit is better.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.960]   So don't care about the news.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.840]   From your ears to Kevin Pollock's lips.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   No, that's wrong.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:07.000]   I mean, if people have this thing like, oh, in progress everywhere else is good, right?
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.880]   But in the newspaper business, progress is bad.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:09.880]   Right.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880]   You know, I, killing freeze is a good thing.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880]   I guess.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880]   You're not going to kill trees.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.880]   I like the Sunday paper.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.600]   I mean, I like, uh, well, once a week is fine, but it's, it is a kindle bad for the environment.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.000]   I have a kindle.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   Have you ever tried to read a newspaper in the kindle?
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   It's not a good experience.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   It doesn't feel right.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.240]   No, it's well, you know why the Kindle is a linear device for great for books lousy
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.320]   for anything that you want to hop around in.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.320]   Right.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.320]   You can't hop.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.320]   Right.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.320]   There's no hopping.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320]   Do you read it on using Kindle, Gina?
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.320]   I do.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.320]   And I totally agree.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.320]   Books for sure.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.320]   Not so much.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.320]   It's great for books.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.960]   I mean, I get all my books that I'm, if I don't listen to Monotable, I get them on
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:45.960]   the Kindle.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   Do you have them on the iPhone app too?
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960]   It's pretty cool.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:49.960]   It's cool that it sinks, right?
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   Because you can be sitting there and read through pages and go back to your account.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:52.960]   Have you played with that?
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.960]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.760]   Um, it's not easy to read on the iPhone, but it's not awful.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.560]   But it'll kill 10 minutes, right?
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560]   You got it.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560]   Sitting there and doing something.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.560]   Exactly.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.560]   Exactly.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.440]   You know, there's a funny, there's a interesting Twitter account to follow.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.840]   It's called the media is dying.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.840]   I've seen that.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.840]   It's what it's happening.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.320]   It's about what's on a certain newspapers.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.360]   And sometimes they'll post things about how Kindle might be changing or not changing.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360]   I follow that.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.160]   It's really interesting.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.520]   We need a death watch.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.520]   It's not dying.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.520]   It's evolving.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.520]   I mean, look, you're absolutely evolving.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.520]   We're still media.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.520]   This is media.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.520]   Provision three, Twit.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.720]   You just saw three, you know, celebrities in here.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.960]   They're more excited to work in this medium than they are on the last one.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:31.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:34.840]   And with good reason, I mean, you know, they are because they're forward thinking.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.800]   I mean, you look at somebody, you know, Jimmy Fallon, these guys, they know.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.800]   But there's a lot of guys who are going on.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.520]   You know, it's almost all of them.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:46.400]   If you put them in front of it and you show them and I've showed, you know, a dozen celebrity
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.800]   type people, the internet and the interwebs and how it works.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:50.800]   It's the same business for them.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.840]   Oh, the happens is they just, all of a sudden they're like, Oh my God, I can communicate
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:54.840]   with the audience.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.560]   Oh my God, the audience is giving me feedback.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.040]   Oh my God, this is real.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.040]   Careful.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.640]   He's heading out the middleman in a lot of cases.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.720]   Like if you take a look at like Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, what they do.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:05.720]   They're right there.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:10.000]   They're just a lot of people who are like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.440]   like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.440]   like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:25.080]   like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.880]   are like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah,
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.880]   yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, yeah, they're like
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:38.080]   in paradigm to understand how that's communicated. I'm sure that those who the predecessor of
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.440]   traditional media, some thought very, very similar things. It's that now we can live
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.520]   in a time where we can have conversations about how and why information is changing.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.880]   And that's fascinating. You know, I know that that old media 100 years ago, we're having
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:57.640]   these discussions, but but now we can have them in a public context. We can allow new
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:03.800]   ideas to come into the discussion and and form how information moves and changes. You
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:09.680]   know, it's it's a vastly different time period. You know, it's really fascinating. Leo, our
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.800]   next sponsor is really fascinating. You're watching the chatroom, aren't you, Jason?
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:19.520]   Yes, I am. Jason's getting his cues now from the chat room. Absolutely. And our next sponsor,
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.600]   please tell me who it is. Ladies and gentlemen, please make my dream come true. This portion
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:33.400]   of Twitter is brought to you. No, don't do it. Audible.com. Audible. Oh, I love it. Have
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:41.120]   you heard Christopher Walken on audible? You know who does a great walk in is Kevin Pollock.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.080]   Kevin Pollock does the best. He's the king of walking. He is the heat. I copied my walk
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:49.120]   and from now on about 40% as good as that's how you know a guy does a good impression is
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.760]   that when you copy his impression, you know, his impression is impressive. You still sound
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:57.320]   good. That's a good impression. You got this. I have to tell you, I love what I was doing
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:01.520]   with the ray. He does that reading of the Raven. It is awesome. Is that on the home, the
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.800]   Raven? I don't know. Christopher Walken has a Twitter account. Yes, it's awesome. But
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.440]   is it really him? Yes, it's really him because Keith Olbermann was all upset the other day
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:14.600]   because it's not really Keith Olbermann and his 20,000 followers. So what does he say on
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:20.640]   his Twitter account? They're just crazy tweets. Your father gave me this watch. You know,
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:27.480]   I like there's a fake Gary Busey. That's pretty funny. Kind of out of control. I should read
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.920]   I should do dramatic reading of this of this Twitter account of Christopher Walken. An
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:36.400]   associate told me he'd been cheating on his wife. He asked me not to talk about it. And
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:44.360]   I probably won't unless it comes up somehow. Thank you. Thank you very much. That's amazing
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:50.800]   his account is C walking C W a L K E and that's amazing. So much smoke for me for my previous
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.680]   comment regarding the Pope. I don't see a smile option in Twitter. Probably a good thing
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:04.720]   to have though. Smite. All right, I'm following him. We got we got to get Kevin Pollock. He
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.320]   just read Christopher Walken's Twitter account. All right. All right, a dramatic reading of
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.920]   Christopher. Maybe you save that for your show. How about that? Save that for us. What
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:18.120]   about audible? What about audible audible audible.com/twit to you could sign up today and get the platinum
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.120]   account. I like the platinum because it gives you two books. And I could I go through two
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:27.520]   books a month easily. It's no problem at all. Audible, of course, as you must know by now,

[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:42.720]   club performances. I bet you Pollock's on here. There's radio shows, a lot of BBC classic BBC
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:48.920]   stuff on there. It's wonderful. Audible.com. What did you do? I got so excited about audible.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:51.960]   I just spilled my tea all over your desk. I don't care about the desk. It looks like
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:25:00.280]   you spilled it on my chocolate. Forget the desk. Save the chocolate napkin. It's all right.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:06.160]   Okay. We this is an Oriental rug, but it's really not Kevin. Yes. I have your friend here.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:14.880]   Look who's here in my office. Is this your own? Hello, she's cute. Hello, representative.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:21.880]   Hello, Kevin. Hey, everyone. Hey, Kevin. Hey. Yeah, my name is Leo. Just but don't worry
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:26.480]   about me. How much do you love audible? What? How much do you love audible audible audible

[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:36.200]   sure of the star. She does like a ton of stuff for is it ABC out there that she does it for
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:45.160]   an LA? Oh, so. All right. Well, there you go. It's just a Hollywood extravaganza at the
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.920]   Calicam. I'm sorry. It's just getting crazy here. What is up? Does he just invite people
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:53.280]   over like all day long to just know what happened is we're doing Kevin show here and
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.360]   I told everybody on my mailing list, they could just show up. So now there's like 100
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.840]   people here drinking beer. I'm taking cues from you, Kevin. I thought this was a good
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:07.840]   party. And now I'm feeling like I want to go down there. Anyway, let me mention audible.com.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.280]   Audible.com just go there. No, no, no, I'm happy. You're not happy party with Prager?
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:17.120]   I'm happy. No, I'm happy. This is good. I'm very happy. Prager brings a party. Prager
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.040]   is the party. Exactly right. Exactly. Did you know there's an erotic and sexuality
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:29.160]   section on audible.com? Yeah, and it's great. Play something, play something from the erotic
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:34.000]   section, please. All right, I guess I can. There you have kids and young adults too. Would
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.640]   you like to hear that instead? No, I'll go with the erotic and sexuality. We're trying
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.440]   to get the sponsor value, Leo. Okay, in bed with Susie Bright. Susie Bright is now my
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:48.240]   Facebook friend. I don't know how she she knew to. Oh, yeah. And that was Susie Bright
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.200]   is awesome. She's great. I love those in paradise. They have on audible and I just grabbed that.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:58.560]   That might be a very upper pro pick as well. It might not be erotic enough, but you know,
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.400]   not erotic enough. I actually love Bobo's in paradise. That was a great book. I actually
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:09.160]   did not listen to it on audible.com. David Brooks. Yeah, the author, of course, he's
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.360]   the he's the conservative columnist for the new the new the new bill, Crystal on the New
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:20.000]   York Times. And it's the new upper class and how they got there. I don't know what you're
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.160]   saying by that, Dan. What are you saying by that? What are you implying? I wonder sometimes
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:30.240]   because because you know, I have my families from from Jersey and New York and you know,
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.240]   I grew up in the Midwest and I went to a very small school. He's starting to sell like Christopher
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:41.760]   Walker. Did you notice that? Well, everybody's video show at that point. You know, I'm writing
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.880]   them two blocks from Brill Hall and Brooklyn. I get a lot of the accent. But anyway, I wonder
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:52.480]   sometimes and I try to bring myself into this mindset again as much as I love technology and I
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:57.280]   love talking about the future of communication. I wonder if we don't live in our own little bubble.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:03.200]   You know, I know that and I know the career talking about the news bubble and the media bubble that
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.720]   traditional media is in, but I'm also a little concerned that to middle America, we may look like
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.360]   a bunch of dilettants running around with our. I promise you, that's exactly why people hate
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.360]   Twitter. That's why South by Southwest looks like a, you know, a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.960]   solopsis love fest. I mean, it's not. Yeah. Yeah. It's and so I mentioned Bobo's
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:27.920]   in paradise because, you know, he he does talk a lot about this this new class of people who seek
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:33.360]   out the simulacra as opposed to the the authentic. And yet we're all kind of on this desperate search
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:38.160]   for the authentic. What does Twitter do? We kind of breaks it breaks down these barriers so that we
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.680]   can access people on on so-called celebrities on a much more authentic level.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:48.400]   No, at the same time, I had I had speaking oxen and now reply to me the other day. It was
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:53.280]   amazing. You were at Snoop Dogg sending an hour of life. That's wild, isn't it? It was the best thing
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.320]   ever. And then and then you said something about shizzle and manazole. And that's what he said for
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:04.000]   shizzle something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can. My case is all are his twizzles. My twizzles.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.280]   Yeah. My drink has some twizzles. Yeah. Yeah. I love it.
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.400]   My k rose isle. My k rose isle. Can you spare a dig a zizzle?
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:20.000]   So Bobo's in paradise. I think this is a great pick Dan. Thank you. The new upper class and how
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.280]   they got there by David Brooks. This isn't one of his more recent books. I think this is
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.040]   five or six years old, but it's really let me play a little bit of it. I don't think there's
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.760]   anything erotic in here. The thing that struck me as oddest was the way the old categories no
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:39.040]   longer made sense. Throughout the 20th century, it's been pretty easy to distinguish between the
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:44.880]   bourgeois world of capitalism and the Bohemian counterculture. The bourgeoisie were the square
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:50.160]   practical ones. They defended tradition in the middle class. The Bohemians are now the new bourgeoisie.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:53.280]   That's very interesting. Yeah. Was that being read by C3PO?
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:57.680]   You know what? Some of the. You're a bourgeoisie are quite like Arthur Mills.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:04.480]   What do you expect? He's a conservative writer for the New York Times. He's a C3PO.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:08.960]   Yeah. So the book, I think in fact I'm seeing this now. It is on my library. I did listen to
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:12.720]   it on Audible. It's Bobo's in paradise, the new upper class, how they got there are pick of the
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:19.280]   week, but you can get two books if you go to audible.com/twit2 and sign up for the beautiful
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:24.320]   platinum plan. Two books a month, but the first two are free and we do thank Audible so much.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:28.160]   You know what's cool that you can do with, I think most devices with audio books are like Audible's
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:31.920]   audio books. You can speed it up. Yeah, it's great. Driving and you want to listen to something and
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:37.440]   it's kind of narrated too slow. You can just speed it up. Oh, that is awesome. And I have seen
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:42.560]   yeah, a very good one. And then when it speeds it up, it employs something that keeps like the
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:47.440]   tone down so you're like a Mickey Mouse. But I think I've seen Gina studies that say that we
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:52.880]   actually comprehend better at higher speeds. Oh, yeah. So if you didn't better, give your mind
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:58.480]   time to wander while it's trying to speak. Maybe that's it. We ADD types do better when it's talking
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:02.160]   very fast because we get bandit. Oh, look at bicycle. Well, that's what the problem with Twitter and
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:08.320]   Facebook is it just promotes ADD. No, no, no, tabbed browsing promotes that is I got to turn that
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:12.640]   off some time. What do you do? You open a lot of time? Absolutely. Like how many tabs do you
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.440]   have open right now? Let's take a poll. How many tabs? Okay, one, two, three, four, nine, six, seven,
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:22.720]   eight. But wait a minute, I have two browsers open. So okay, I'm nine. What do you, what do you
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:29.280]   have? Eight, fifteen. I've got thirteen. Yeah. Oh my God, you guys are a mess. We are a mess.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.640]   Well, I leave stuff open until I'm done with it and sometimes to shut my computer down if I don't
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:36.640]   save the tabs, I'll just have to. We have to like try and finish each tab so I can close them all
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:40.160]   out. Do you ever go back to like a tab that has Gmail open with the email that you already wrote
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:44.240]   and you're like, why didn't I just hit send? Oh, yeah. All the time. I have all the time. I have one
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.400]   said mail. I hate when the hajina. Is there a cure for this? Is there something we can do?
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.720]   Yeah, help us. Help us life hacker. You are only hope.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:56.640]   Step away from the computer. That's what I do. I can't do that.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.280]   Yeah, I'm all about the like, I'm all about the like forcing myself to single focus. Like there
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:04.720]   are times when my tab bar or my tab bar gets to the point where I can't read where I'm only seeing
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.880]   fav icons. That's when I do like the cleanup, you know what I mean? Or when like the same thing on
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:12.720]   the dock of the task bar, I just kind of do that like clean up every couple hours like, okay, close
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:18.000]   this window, send the email done with that. But you're not one of those loathsome inbox zero types,
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.720]   are you? I aspire to be. I aspire to be I don't aspire to be loathsome, but I do aspire to have
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:29.360]   no email in my inbox. And I don't know, I'm not very successful. Let's see. Right now I've got
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:35.680]   I've got 30 in my inbox right now. So emails? Yeah, I've been killed for 30. Yeah, I'm well,
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:40.320]   I file like I deal with email and then archive it immediately. So yes, I am one of those loathsome
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:47.680]   types. I have 32,948 messages in my inbox 4,114 on red. But do you live email because like I
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:51.680]   used to get the inbox here, I'd have to do amnesty. I'd have to delete them all. They call email
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:55.680]   bankruptcy. Yeah, bankruptcy. Lessing less. Lessing good. Then it's like you send a reply all to
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:00.480]   all on red saying I did just declared bankruptcy and delete them all. I don't think I could even do
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:05.040]   that. I think I just have to post on the blog. If you sent me email once, it's long gone. So send
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:09.760]   it again. I have really strong filters and I send lots of canned responses that's like, I'm really
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:15.920]   sorry to send you this impersonal thing. But here's the generic answer. I have a kind of a jerk.
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:23.360]   I have a text. I have a text expander macro SSORRY. I sent it and says, I can't help you. Go away.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.440]   Text expander rocks. Text expander is a life saver. Yeah, it really is.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:32.160]   Now email. What's his name? The wine guy Gary. Gary.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:37.440]   Very, very. Yeah. Gary's like you get a link back to a video and he's like, okay, it's Gary.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:40.640]   Listen, you email me. I love that you email me. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:44.480]   I love everybody and we're going to get there. But okay, here's I love my family. I love the Jets.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:53.600]   I cannot respond, but I can love you. And then he gives a list of links to commonly asked questions.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.880]   Yeah, I've done that, but I didn't do the video. I really think that's a good idea. And I think
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.800]   the key is to say I love you, right? Yeah, just keeps saying over and over again.
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:05.600]   It's incredible. You're just killing it. You're great. You're going to do great. You're wonderful.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:10.720]   You're a wonderful person. I love you. I love honestly. You think like maybe it's a little cheesy,
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:16.160]   like the Gary thing. Totally. Indeed. Totally authentic. That's totally a real guy. I love that
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.920]   guy. Gary's for real though. You know what I mean? He's not just doing it just because he wants like
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:25.840]   press or people. He's just a good song. Is this sincere? Yes. He is totally authentic and sincere.
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:31.600]   It's almost like he died. And this is his obituary.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:37.520]   He was a great guy. He's never been on the show. Gary was awesome. He's going to have a lot of
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:40.880]   time on his hands. He's taking a lot of time at home because his wife's about to have a baby.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:44.480]   Oh, really? Got a new baby? So like he's going to be languishing and itching to do.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:48.240]   Okay. I'm going to ask him on Twitter. Well, I'm on next week. Somebody just said this is the best
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.520]   Twitter ever. Twitter is in the chatroom. I'd like everybody in the chatroom to rate
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:56.960]   Twitter on a scale of one to 10. This episode. Please rate the show. Please rate the show.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.880]   And so put a number and then what you think of the show. It's like 49.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.880]   One to 10. I got a nine. Nine. Nine. Nine. We got a billion. Two point five.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:12.240]   A lot of them. A lot of them. A lot of them. Somebody said it to 11. 666. Apparently,
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.480]   a devil worshiper in the chatroom. They're raising it to the power of.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:21.920]   Yeah, you can't put pie in there, guys. Somebody says three strong hits of LSD. That's good.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:28.960]   I think this is Adderall, virtual Adderall. Who is it that said that? Was that you, David?
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:31.280]   That's what we need. That might have been me. Was it you, Dan?
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.400]   Well, I do. I'm just saying we, you know, if that's the metaphor, we need some kind of
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:41.280]   digital Adderall to focus us. Turn off the computers. What, Gina says, is coming right?
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.600]   Okay, everybody, please stop. Please stop right now. Are you telling? Are you telling
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.760]   up the votes? Now. And Steve Wozniak is the winner. Can you believe?
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:56.880]   I watched that. Can you believe Belinda Carlisle lost to Steve Wozniak?
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:02.480]   It's like that's got to be the most the most horrible thing that could ever happen to you.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.600]   Woz brings in ratings. Everyone kind of want he's the underdog, right?
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.800]   He's mad. You know, he's actually a little angry because he feels like, you know,
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:14.080]   they never reveal what the online voting was. He feels like they're actually hiding that,
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:20.000]   that they're that he says the producers planned for Belinda Carlisle and me to have a dance off.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.400]   That's what happened last Tuesday. They wanted that for the ratings. They didn't care
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:28.880]   about the vote about the online votes. And you're and he's right. They never tell you what the
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:34.720]   online votes are. I voted for him 13 times both of us. lawsuit lawsuit was 13 different phones,
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:41.120]   right? No, no, no, if you're 18 t, you can send 13 really text messages. You can vote for anybody
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.160]   13 times. You get 13 votes. I guess because that was there were 13 contestants. And then next week,
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:51.680]   they'll be 12 and 11. So, so yeah, Belinda Carlisle of the go goes of all people.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:57.440]   That's got to be humiliating because because frankly, Steve was a dance in Teletubby. Let's face it.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:03.920]   He did not. Oh, but you have to love him. Come on. Oh, he's. And that's why he won because I think
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:09.760]   everybody goes his spirit, his heart. He's loving this. He's enthusiastic. He doesn't. He's not a
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:15.120]   good dancer. I don't think anybody has that illusion, but he's he's trying so hard. He broke
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:21.120]   his he's off. He broke his foot and still danced. That's right. Steve. Oh, didn't even do that.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:27.280]   What happened to Steve? Oh, yeah. His back started hurting. And then he did he threw into the dance
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.520]   at the last time. Why am I? How can I know this? Oh,
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:36.000]   because we can't see. Can we take a minute to acknowledge the fact that
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:42.960]   not a star galactic ended on Friday? No spoilers. No spoilers. I've not watched. Okay. No spoilers.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:48.000]   Please like everybody to get a glass. Everybody everybody get a glass and we're going to say
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:52.560]   to the galactic of the best ship in the fleet. So say we all. Yes.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.720]   So say we all. All right.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:01.200]   Hey, we all. I think a great note to end this show. Thank you, Gina, for reminding us the most
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:07.360]   important geek event of the week. Exactly. That's what I'm here. Was the battle star galactic.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:12.080]   And I thank everybody for being here. Gina, you're the greatest life hacker.com. How many times
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:17.280]   do you have to hold up your little signs there? Oh, but not very many. I was actually, it was
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:23.360]   really good. I didn't hold it. Matt once. I got to use seriously, you know, for like a second at one
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:27.600]   point. But for the most part, I didn't even use this one, which was, which was really exciting.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.600]   I thought Jason would at least make me use this one. The WTF? Yeah, but he didn't. He didn't.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:36.800]   So I think this went really well. You know, I adore you. Smarter where.org. Please come back.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:41.280]   We love having you on the show. Thanks for having me on. It is not easy being the one woman with a
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:48.960]   bunch of loudmouth guys. The one chick. The one chick. You did great. Thank you. You did great.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:54.080]   Jason Calicanis is mahalo and he's going to stick around. I guess and you're going to do the Kevin
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:39:01.600]   Pollock show if we could figure out some way. I heart Gina. Audible baby. Why is everything
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:05.920]   backwards? Is there something going on? You have to write it backwards. You have to write it backwards.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.560]   Yeah. But you have to kind of flip it around. I guess that's something. Oh, something weird's
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.000]   doing it. All right. So that's OK. Everybody should watch this show in their rear room mirror and
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.360]   they'll understand it. Jason's at mahalo.com and his new show is coming in a couple of weeks.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:27.200]   Meanwhile, the Kevin Pollock chat show.com. Kevin Pollock's chat show.com. By the way, Gina is

[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:54.000]   You know how we do. Oh, man. Do you have Kevin? You don't have Kevin, Kevin? No, I don't.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:00.000]   Some some schmo has Leo. I had Leo on pounds, but some schmo has Leo on the have answers and
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.560]   questions. That's questions is the one you want. You're offering half a million bucks.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.880]   Yeah, three amazing questions a day. Half a million dollars. Whatever. Also,
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:16.880]   point of just interesting inside baseball stuff. Not only did I try to buy a dig from Kevin for
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:22.000]   an extra on a low fee, which he turned down. Yes, smart move on his part. He'll never let me
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:28.240]   live that down. He has the emails. They'll come out in his book when he writes. I love Kevin.
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:34.240]   But I also tried to hire Gina at least three times and would send her offer letters of
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:40.800]   increasingly large sums of money and equity and tell her at the very least, if you don't take my
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:47.840]   offer, please make dent and pay you more money. I think she did too. Good. Did he? I hope he did.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:58.240]   It was helpful. That's one of the things Jason does. And I know this is he does those offers so
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:04.000]   that you can bid up your current employee. Very clever. I believe in I believe talent
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.320]   needs to get paid. You stay away from Colleen. That's all I can say. You stay away from Colleen
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:14.320]   Colleen at twit.tv. Stop it. Is that it? Yep. Stop it. No, no, no. I just wanted to send her
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:19.280]   name off for being on the show. She would work for you in a heartbeat, Jason. I have no way of
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.360]   keeping her here. She's already passing out over here. And you know what? Prager, by the way,
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.720]   I just wanted to let you know you were did excellent contributions to the show. Definitely
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:28.400]   call me if you're in LA. Stay away from Prager.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:32.400]   You're going to be standing there right there. What does that have to do with you? Everybody needs a
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.560]   total. How's it going there? Are you still the third guy on the totem pole? What's the story?
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.960]   The third guy on the totem pole. So what's the totem pole according to Jason at revision three?
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.200]   J. Oh, I don't know. The CEO and then J. Metals and Kevin Metals. I mean,
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.760]   I would say we got like you should be starting to make some own decision.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:51.520]   He was the true founder. He built revision three. I mean, if it weren't for Prager,
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:55.760]   there'd be no one who was there. Yeah, no doubt. Prager has put more time and effort in
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.360]   building revision three. There's no question about that. No, I don't that. Every time I've seen
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.880]   you guys taping something or doing something, I see Prager actually doing the work. Right.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.760]   Every show. And don't forget Pragerpedia.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:11.360]   Pragerpedia. What? This is a Pragerpedia? Oh, yeah. It's his new Mahalo competitor,
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.760]   actually. Oh, wow. Look out. He's like, yeah, I'm really scared.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:21.200]   There's some good answers there. Pragerpedia.net. Oh, not net. I'm no wonder it didn't pop up.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.280]   I'm going to just Twitter that Pragerpedia. Wait, wait, wait. Let me get there before you
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:31.760]   put her. Oh, it's already down. Yeah, Prager, you might want to get it off of a server.
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.000]   It's not a brand. Some fans made it. Oh, there it is. There it is. BAM, Pragerpedia.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:44.400]   Who's awesome is that? It's so killer. I got it. I got it. All right. What's a question?
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:49.360]   What's a question for Pragerpedia? I am Prager bringing the truth, asking you shall receive is
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:55.280]   what it says. I might not be right, but it sounds good. Dan, give me a question for him.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:58.320]   What kind of car should Kevin Rose get? There you go. What kind of, that's good,
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.320]   because last time he was on Jason, you had a good car for him, right? What was it that you
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.920]   were going to work? I don't know. How do you understand? How do you understand?
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:10.960]   Kevin Rose get. Will it know an answer to that? I don't know. In-turnal server era.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:17.680]   Yeah, it's down. 404. 404. That's the car. Well, the Audi 404. That's a fine car.
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:20.720]   They should have put that website on a square space, but they should have done it.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.920]   It says, Kevin Rose smells like flowers on a rainy day. That's very true, actually.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:31.360]   And I enjoy his company. I hope he gives me a nice share of the money he'll earn on the dig Google
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:41.760]   sale. Wow. Oh, I love that. Oh, my God. David Prager, thank you for being here, revision3.com.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:46.160]   You're doing great work over there. And at deal Prager. I had deal Prager on the Twitter.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.120]   How can you know? What? Another guy broke into your house?
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:53.200]   No, the revision3 motion sensor went off. And I was like a mile away. I'm like, well,
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.480]   I guess I'll go check it out. And it called the cops. So I'm waiting for the cops. I'm like,
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.520]   all right, I'll wait for the cops. And the cops apparently drove around the building and left.
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.440]   I'm like, okay, I'm going to get an alarm system in here. And I told Dan, I said,
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.080]   they don't answer the alarm. What do they do? They don't come.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:10.960]   Just leave a stick am up. That's what I'm doing. I'm leaving the break in an HV. You know,
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:14.560]   how many ratings you'll get for that? That's a good idea. We'll stream forever.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.200]   Also, Kevin Rose. Where do you want to plug? KevinRose.com.

[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.160]   Yeah. It's just for fun. But we got some new stuff coming out for
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:35.040]   digging a couple of weeks. So make sure to check it out. Yeah, that sounds cool. And the dig's

[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.760]   off. Dan Patterson.me. Dan, thank you for being here. You picked a good show.
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:17.120]   That's what's called another.com. But thanks. You picked a good show to pop your cherry on, my friend.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.360]   Wow. We're going to eat. We're going to eat that out. I have some skittles.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:26.480]   Those cherry skittles are amazing. That's how he gets you. He gives you a couple skittles.

[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:38.720]   He's a lot of big words. A lot of big words.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:44.800]   I'm trying to be as pretentious as possible. No, no, no. He's got some good insights. I give
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:49.040]   I give Dan's first appearance a seven and a half. All right. That's good. It's hard. It's tough.
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:52.640]   That's really a tough thing. You know, a tough house. Everybody in the chat room rate Dan's
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:58.960]   appearance. No, stop. Yes, do it. I'm just at the parents of Y. Oh, dear. Another Twitch.
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:07.360]   He's in the can and I mean it.
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:26.080]   All right.
