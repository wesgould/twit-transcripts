[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.360]   in your house, and the cost of YouTube influencers.

[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.000]   conversation to my right Jason Snell from 6colors.com, the incomparable.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Hi, Jason.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I was told there would be Turkey.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   What happened?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.800]   I can, well, you know, I didn't even have Turkey at Thanksgiving.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   I had a ham.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   Oh, all right.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.040]   Well, that's kind of boring, but I can go get you a ham.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.080]   Let me tell you, ham goes a long way.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.960]   I had a 16-pound ham.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.280]   I've been told never to accept internet ham.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.760]   Yes, you're probably smart.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   Good to be here.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760]   Mike Elgin is here back from his travels.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   That's right.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.960]   He is our Gastronomad at Elgin.com and Gastronomad.net.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   How you doing?
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.960]   We're doing good.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.960]   Are you home for the holidays?
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.040]   We are essentially living in Mexico City through the end of the year, but we came back for
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.200]   the holidays and we're heading back to Mexico City in like a week.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.400]   Is that the next experience?
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.200]   Gastronom experience in Mexico City.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   Oh, how fun.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   Ringing the new year.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.280]   Oh, see, I'd like to do New Year's in Mexico City.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.280]   It's great.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.120]   I've done New Year's Eve in Mexico in Mazatlan, I think, and that was the Mexican style of
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.720]   New Year's Eve is really fantastic.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.160]   So it should be really great.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.760]   Ben Morocco in April.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.800]   You're back to Prosecco in the spring.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Provence?
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.120]   Provence is almost booked solid already and it's coming up in the summer.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   It's a small group though.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.560]   I mean, you're not bringing 3,000 people with you.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.400]   It's about four or five couples.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.840]   Provence, we do 10 couples.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.000]   It's a big house.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Nice.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.760]   Great to have you.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.560]   And I saved the best for last.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   Adam Fisher's never been on to it before.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.080]   So I want to give him a nice big plug.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.960]   Adam is the host of our podcast, Valley of Genius, based on his book, Valley of Genius.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.120]   And I'm thrilled to have you on.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   Thank you.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.120]   I was thinking maybe I was the turkey.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.120]   No.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.320]   Adam is a technology journalist for a long time.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.160]   We've written for many magazines, including Wired.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.400]   But this book, Valley of Genius, is so much fun because it's interviews with the people
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.000]   who made Silicon Valley happen.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.040]   What happened is I interviewed him for triangulation about the book and he mentioned, "Oh yeah,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040]   these are all audio.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   I have them all."
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   Why don't we all?
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.000]   I have hundreds of hours of interviews with some of the 200 of the top visionaries.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.440]   I said, "That's a podcast."
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.440]   So we made it.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.280]   I think it's good we're in episode 12, we're thinking we've got many more to come.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   Mining the archive.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   Scraping mining.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.240]   You have a large archive.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.800]   I said initially it was on tape.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   It's not on tape.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.560]   You didn't bring a little Norelco cassette record into tape.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   Not tape.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.560]   Okay.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   MP3.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   Let's see.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   You know what?
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.080]   I probably should have reviewed the stories of the week before we began the show.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.480]   I want to start with a little controversy.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.920]   There's very little happening.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.280]   It's the slow time.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.600]   Should we share recipes?
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.880]   Is that what this episode's last segment will be?
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.880]   Okay.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.160]   I made cornbread stuffing, which I wouldn't recommend.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   How do you stuff a ham?
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   A ham, you don't.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.800]   So I thought, "Well, I'm going to make stuffing that isn't going to go inside a bird."
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.280]   Never put stuffing inside a bird.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   No, it's bad.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.280]   You just give yourself poison.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   Yeah, it's bad for you.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   It's bad.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   So I made cornbread.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   But cornbread tastes like cornbread.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.880]   And that kind of put me off a slash.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.880]   Slash.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.880]   Sawdust.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.880]   What was I thinking?
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.480]   We had sausage in it.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.320]   Jimmy Dean, pure park, but it didn't say it didn't say it.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.720]   So anyway, that's my recipe.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.720]   Don't.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   Okay.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.800]   Yeah, ham with stuffing that had pork in it.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   This is a lot of...
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.560]   It was a very porcine meal.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   It was.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.200]   I also had lasagna with pork in it.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   I think we need your recipes.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   You're the guy.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   He's the cook.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   What did you do for Thanksgiving?
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   We did two turkeys.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   We did...
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.960]   My wife doesn't like stuffing at all, so we didn't do stuffing.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.120]   She does a chanterel mushroom gravy that's just unbelievable.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.440]   We did all the stuff.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.440]   But yeah.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.960]   I mean, our style was really, really good.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.960]   So I made the rules.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   How was your Thanksgiving, Adam?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.280]   I didn't get an invite to get this Thanksgiving, so not so good.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   No, no.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280]   The mirror is the best cook I know.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   She's amazing.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.280]   She's amazing.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.280]   She's amazing.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   She's amazing.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   She's amazing.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280]   She's amazing.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.280]   She's amazing.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   She's amazing.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   And how about you?
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   You had turkey, right?
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   I'm Brian to turkey.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   I made some cornbread dressing.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   But the Alden Brown technique was very good.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.280]   It's very good.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.280]   They're double dipping.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.720]   They did the Canadian Thanksgiving, and then they came here for the American Thanksgiving.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.600]   But they brought a Canadian dish.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.800]   It was like a meat pie, and they put maple syrup on it.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   Oh, God.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   Has anybody heard of this?
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   Is this real?
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   We'd be imponked.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   No, Chris is nodding.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   He says, I know.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.800]   Oh, yeah, I know that.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   Never heard of that.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   You put cheese curds on it, then?
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   Ooh.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   Wisconsin.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   No, no, Toronto.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.640]   Actually, I think Montreal's famous for poutine, right?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.640]   All right.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.640]   I'm french fries.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.640]   I love it.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.640]   Roll it in the chat room, sis.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.120]   Leo starts to it in media race, like the best epic poetry in the middle.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.120]   That's right.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.280]   We cut out all that early stuff, whatever.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.520]   And then, Odysseus said, Washington asks allies to drop Huawei.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.240]   This is a Wall Street Journal story, and I just really don't know what to think about.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.200]   And I thought, well, what I'll do is I'll ask our esteemed panel.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.080]   So, let me give you the background on this.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.400]   It actually started in 2012 when Congress told telecommunication companies to be afraid
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.640]   of Huawei ZTE and other Chinese telecom companies because they had either investments from or
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.480]   connections to the Chinese military.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.520]   That's the first we heard it, then the Department of Commerce echoed it.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.680]   But now, according to the Wall Street Journal, the US government is reaching out to allies,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.280]   Germany, Italy, and Japan about using Huawei equipment.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   These are countries, friendly countries, where Huawei equipment is widely in use.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.200]   Huawei, believe it or not, is the number two smartphone manufacturer after Samsung, and
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.480]   the number one telecommunications company in the world.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.840]   And for 5G networks, the future networks for many of these cell companies, Huawei's the
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   choice.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.800]   Thunder of Huawei is a former military in China.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.280]   It's closely allied with the Chinese leadership.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.680]   And so, there's a lot of nervousness about it.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.640]   It's not just the countries you mentioned, but also Australia and a few others.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:19.480]   The US is urging some countries to avoid Huawei and ZTE equipment, actually.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.200]   There are other countries where this is particularly contentious.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.760]   I mentioned Australia.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.320]   It's a big deal in Australia.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.560]   They really don't want to have their 5G infrastructure, which we all know is coming.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.880]   We all know there's going to be huge investment.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:40.240]   The amount of infrastructure in 5G is inherently many times more than you need for 4G, simply
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.160]   because you have to be closer to the...
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   It's micro millimeter.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.560]   And so, you've got to have...
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.760]   It doesn't go very far.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   That's right.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.280]   It's not like you put a tower and then it serves everything.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.160]   You're going to have them in corporate buildings.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160]   You're going to have them inside tunnels everywhere.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:01.120]   And so, there's nervousness that the Chinese government could somehow use this as a spy
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120]   tool.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.040]   Well, there's two nodes by network that we're going to roll out at our expense.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.240]   Well, there's two threats.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.240]   There's that that they might spy on in companies, industrials, espionage.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.560]   But the other threat is cyber warfare that they could flip a switch and the whole thing
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.200]   could go down.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.240]   Both of those are scary.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.440]   The journal doesn't say who their sources were, just US officials.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.720]   So, we don't know if this is from the intelligence community, the commerce department, or the
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.720]   White House.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.080]   And that's what concerns me a little bit because we know that we're in a trade war with China
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.560]   and that the administration's policy has been very anti-China.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.280]   So, it's one thing if there's a technical reason for this.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.120]   There's another thing if it's a political reason for this.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.880]   And I don't know if it's completely clear.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:52.400]   According to the journal, American officials met with executives of Italy's major telecom
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.360]   carriers to explain the risk of using Huawei and ZTE equipment.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.280]   The Italian said, "Yeah, we're aware of the risks, but we're going to keep on using
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   Huawei."
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.240]   He said, "We cannot ignore Huawei because they are a leading telecom equipment provider
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.840]   worldwide and that's a very tough call."
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.560]   That's also a very bad Italian.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.120]   So this is the problem is there's no one else.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.760]   And one of the things Washington apparently wants to do is kind of promote US companies
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.000]   to start making this gear.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.480]   I don't know who that would be and I don't know how they would make the gear anywhere
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.120]   but China.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.080]   Not to mention the fact that that iPad you're using, the iPhone I'm carrying, that MacBook
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.520]   you're using, that iPad you're using, they're all made in China by American companies but
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.640]   made in China.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.160]   I don't know if the response is, "Well, let's just not use Huawei."
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.840]   Shades of Super Micro, right?
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   Right.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.200]   I talked to Huawei, the Huawei's director PR who is in Seattle, I guess probably Huawei
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.920]   US was at an event I went to and I asked her about this because remember the P20?
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.280]   Very nice Huawei phone that they were going to sell in the United States.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.880]   They announced it at CES last year and they said, "We've got deal, carrier deals with
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.360]   Verizon and AT&T at which point the US government went to Verizon and AT&T and said, "Nice network
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   you got here.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.960]   Be ashamed of anything that happened to it."
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.960]   And AT&T Verizon both dropped it and Huawei was furious and they pulled that you can
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.680]   buy this phone in any country in the world except the US because they said, I asked her,
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.040]   she said, "There's no point in trying to push a phone in the United States if you don't
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.520]   have a carrier deal.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.400]   The Americans won't buy it so we're not going to spend millions marketing the P20 which
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.000]   is by the way a very good phone or they're new when they're May 20 in the United States
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.520]   because we can't get a carrier to carry it because of the US government."
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.040]   I said, "But what about this issue?
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.040]   I have a P20.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.120]   Should I worry that everything I say on the phone is getting sent to China?"
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.040]   He said, "It all goes through Germany."
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:04.040]   So the core of this conflict is not a Trump administration thing and it's not a protectionist
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   thing.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.240]   It's not about protecting Apple's market share and phones or anything ridiculous like that.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.600]   There's serious concern simply because the Chinese government is very, very good, thorough
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.720]   and aggressive with espionage, with industrial espionage.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.960]   They robbed the West blind of technology secrets from military, from Boeing to Silicon Valley
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   and so on.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   They're very good at it.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.840]   We catch a tiny fraction of the spies that they deploy.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.600]   So there's this long history of the US just getting our lunch handed to us and so this
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.880]   is something they feel that they can do in a big way to protect.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.800]   And of course, the genius is in Washington who were making the most noise, have no idea
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.400]   how 5G works or how it could be used or whatever.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:55.240]   They just don't trust any Chinese government affiliated company like Huawei and that's
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.560]   really what's driving it.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.600]   It's kind of an irrational fear but given the history, it's rational to fear.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.120]   The industrial espionage of China.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   It is.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's happening right now in a wide scale.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   We can thank the Chinese spy establishment for potentially restarting the American manufacturing,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.640]   high tech manufacturing base.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.040]   If it happens, but right now we just have to believe it's happening.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.840]   It doesn't have to happen.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.080]   It doesn't have to happen.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.720]   We just have to believe that.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.720]   This is the problem.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.840]   You got a journal of quartz, an executive from British Telecom saying we'd like to not
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.760]   use Huawei but right now this is it.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.760]   This is what's out there.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   Look at their market share.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   They're like graph's Jason.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   Market share.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   The market share.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.920]   Huawei is the red bar in Asia, Pacific and Europe.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   It's dominant.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.600]   North America barely exists.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.720]   Erickson and Nokia are dominant and that's because of US.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.280]   The government is doing some good.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:58.760]   I feel like I worry that focusing on ZT and Huawei really kind of misses the overall threat.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   Right?
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.760]   It's a band-aid.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.680]   Politicians want to appear to be doing something.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.000]   This is a kind of a bandwagon that's easy to jump on because it's in motion and there's
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.240]   a lot of noise about it thanks to the US Congress who've been talking about and doing
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.120]   reports about Huawei for I don't know what a decade, 15 years, something like that.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.880]   It's just this kind of political theme that has been picked up in the English speaking
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.080]   world and a few allies.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:34.400]   I hope it's not kind of chauvinistic or racist in some ways.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   I don't think it is.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:41.360]   We gladly accept so much, so many products.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.720]   We should be more concerned about some of the food additives and ingredients that come
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.360]   that are manufactured in China.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.360]   It's organic.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.360]   Oh, great.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.360]   I'm glad to do it.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.360]   We're so dependent on China at this point.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.360]   Actually, they're quite dependent on us too.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   I mean, it's an industry.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.240]   Well, think about all the operating systems that are popular in China even.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.000]   They are from American companies.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   So it goes both ways.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.960]   They could quite reasonably say the same thing.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.560]   They could be concerned that there are exploits that are known that are allowing the US government
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.360]   to spy on what they're doing too.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.680]   I do think it works both ways, but it does feel a little bit like we all enjoyed the
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.200]   economic prosperity of working with China in terms of tech manufacturing.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.280]   And then at some point, somebody in the intelligence industry said, "Oh, wait a second.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.600]   They make everything in the world."
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.080]   But networking, what if they're going to use this against us at some point?
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   Right.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.560]   I mean, I acknowledge the merit of that.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:40.560]   I just feel like the worst case outcome of this would be that we only use stuff made
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.560]   in America.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   They only use stuff made in China.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.800]   It would be bad for everybody.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.520]   A global economy is good for everybody.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.840]   And by the way, it's good for peace because there is strong incentive not to screw with
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.840]   America.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.960]   But everything being made in China is not a global economy.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:16:00.680]   I think what we'd let the best case scenario is that this whole issue causes other countries
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:07.240]   to double down on investment in building 5G infrastructure so that we don't end up relying
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.720]   on two companies in China for all this stuff.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   That's what you were saying, Adam.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.720]   It's good for our...
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.400]   If that happens, I think what people have also said about at least consumer electronics
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.200]   is it's not economically feasible to start building these things in the United States.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.880]   It's too expensive.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   Nobody buy them.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.200]   Well, if the price goes up because nobody...
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   No.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   We don't have labor either.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.880]   We'll just develop our robot market to build our...
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.080]   It's good for the robots.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.920]   We'll build our iPhones.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.320]   We'll charge them taxes as well.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.880]   I have a prediction about 5G, though, that I think you're going to be talking about on
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:45.840]   this show over the next two or three years, Leo, which is that I think there's a huge
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.840]   health scare coming from 5G.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.960]   5G networks are far more powerful.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.640]   They have to be far closer to people's houses in test areas in New York and elsewhere where
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.640]   they've rolled them out.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.360]   There have been petitions gathered by local residents, one resident saying that there
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:08.280]   are 60 5G networks within 100 yards of his house or something like that.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.880]   It's largely untested.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.560]   There's been limited testing that shows that there may be some serious health effects.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:21.400]   We've all heard about the health effects around Wi-Fi and regular cellular networks.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.560]   They've always been a mixed bag.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.880]   It damages your health.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.880]   No it doesn't.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   Yes it does.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.880]   No it doesn't.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   That's been going on for years and years.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   But 5G is a different beast altogether.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   It's a much closer...
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.440]   Just down the road to peace, your area.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.440]   Band 5G towers.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   Well, okay.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.040]   That's what the Wired story said, but it's not entirely true because believe it or not,
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.960]   I wrote to the mayor and I said, "Despite mics giving this a balanced view, I would say,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.400]   despite basically there being no scientific evidence that this kind of radiation has
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.000]   an impact on people."
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.320]   They paused their process because to Mike's other point, this is actually a huge...
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.800]   Even if we leave the medical part aside, a logistical problem because these things need
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.040]   to be everywhere.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.760]   And as a city, Mill Valley basically said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's hold on here because
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.760]   we need a plan.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.720]   This isn't as easy as putting a tower somewhere and walking away."
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.360]   And so, there will be people who will petition local governments and say there are health
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.360]   effects.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   There are also other logistical issues.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.840]   Let's test this on poorer communities first before we move it to Mill Valley.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:26.200]   Now, the CDC says that a millimeter wave is much like cell phones that it is not a health
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   threat.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   Although we're starting to see studies that say maybe health cell phones are a health
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   threat.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.520]   It's been floating out there for a long time and there's never been anything that was
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   a...
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.520]   The CDC, Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States government says there's
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.440]   no scientific evidence that provides a definitive answer to the question of cell phones causing
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.400]   cancer.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.800]   Should people stop using cell phones?
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   I don't know.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.880]   But again, it doesn't have to actually cause...
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.600]   This is back to the theme of the show so far.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.760]   It doesn't actually have to be real.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760]   Enough people believe it will.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.080]   And I believe that people will believe that it's a total threat because they'll see it.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   It looks scary and there's...
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.080]   It's a radio.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.600]   But we'll see them a lot more than we currently see cell towers.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600]   And it's new.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:16.640]   The Danish a million woman study found no evidence of human health risks due to millimeter wave
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.840]   or mobile phones.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.400]   It's not the same frequency as mobile phones or is it?
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.320]   It's a higher frequency millimeter wave.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   I don't know.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.320]   I think it is.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.960]   That's why it has to be so close to where you are.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.720]   Anyway, I'm predicting that there's going to be a huge delay from what people think the
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:43.280]   rollout is going to be based in part on the health, widespread health concerns, petitions,
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.560]   lawsuits, all the stuff that delays new technologies.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.560]   That's a shame.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.920]   And the carriers will deploy it somewhere and say, "Look at us.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.040]   We're the first to have this city covered and then the rollout will be very, very slow."
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.560]   So the individual cities, individual corporations, corporations will build this stuff all over
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.480]   the headquarters and stuff like that.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.040]   It already is deployed in various places.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.200]   It's going to be very uneven.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   But this idea that...
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:13.280]   I remember when they rolled out these millimeter wave x-rays at airports, there was a huge
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.440]   ruckus about that.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.320]   Although they still use them and I don't think there's any evidence because you're saying
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.320]   the perception of it.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.400]   The perception, I think it's almost certain that there'll be a lot of hysteria around
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.520]   this.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520]   And it's going to be...
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.840]   I mean, the other thing, I wrote this article about how the whole 5G thing, there's a perception
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.080]   about the timing of it and that perception is way off.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.920]   The health benefits are one thing.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.160]   But you see all these companies saying, "Oh, we're going to be in Austin, New York City,
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.040]   Chicago, Blahby de Blah."
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.200]   None of those cases are.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.160]   They're blanketing the city with 5G coverage.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.000]   You're talking about individual, tiny little neighborhoods.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.360]   If you have a space of just 50 feet where you don't have an antenna, you have no coverage
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360]   there.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.760]   The way the phones are going to work and 5G phones are already coming out is it'll just
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.760]   knock back...
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.000]   Well, it'll stay in 4G most of the time.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   If you're Jason Snell and you're doing heavy-duty video stuff and there's a connection to it,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.400]   a 5G connection, suddenly it'll kick into 5G.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.280]   Why does he get 5G?
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.840]   I want 5G too.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   Too bad.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.200]   But it's still floating in the air, whether you're using it or not.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.000]   You shouldn't stall it in the studio.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   It's 15...
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.760]   Chatham's saying it's 15 gigahertz.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.560]   It's very high frequency.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.800]   But there's so much involved in whether it causes damage to human cells.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.680]   The amount of energy, the distance from the cell tower, the frequency of it, there's
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   not been any...
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   Face the moon.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.280]   There are plenty of people.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.280]   We've got a guy who comes in here.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.280]   He's a fan of the show.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.920]   He comes in here regularly with his laptop, uses our Wi-Fi, but says he's trying to get
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:57.680]   Wi-Fi out of the pedal in the city's schools because it's bad for kids.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.880]   I guess it would be that if it does turn out to cause cancer, we won't know right away.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.360]   Cell phones have been in widespread use for more than 20 years.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.560]   We've seen no increase in brain cancers.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.600]   In fact, I think there's a slight decrease.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.760]   I think the worst impact of Wi-Fi in schools is that what they're...
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.760]   What they're playing.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.760]   They're stretching.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.240]   Not the actual electromagnetic waves.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   We'll talk about China a little more because according to Bloomberg, by the end of 2020,
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.320]   which is just a couple of years out now, not even that much, well, you're two years from
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.280]   now, China will be able to...
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.000]   Beijing will judge every resident based on behavior.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   It's the social credit system which China's been rolling out.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.160]   China's plan to judge each of its 1.3 billion people based on social behavior is moving
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   closer.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:52.920]   I talked to a Reuters journalist who was for 13 years bureau chief in China.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.720]   She was also concerned.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:01.980]   She said, "There's always been this authoritarian drive in China, but technology has suddenly
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.280]   enabled it to a degree on its unprecedented."
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.080]   I know, really going for it.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   Jack Ma.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.080]   Alibaba.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.920]   There was a quote where he said, "When this rolls out, we'll never have a problem at
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.920]   the square again."
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.520]   No, everybody would be nice.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:24.360]   And he meant Tiananmen Square because they can just see it coming and arrest everybody
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.000]   before there's a...
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   It's called totalitarianism.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   I know it's back.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   But the point is...
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   It's an opticon.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Now enabled in ways that it had never been able...
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.360]   This is literally the panopticon.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.520]   Everything that you do can potentially be seen.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   Yeah, it's visible.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.880]   That's why I installed a Facebook portal in my house.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.880]   That's some good idea.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.880]   Good thinking.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   Because I figure Mark is going to be better than anybody.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.880]   I mean, it's like an episode of Black Mirror.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   It is.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   It's literally...
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.880]   It's literally...
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.880]   It's called "Nosedive."
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   It's in season three of Black Mirror.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   You can go watch it.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.720]   The idea that eventually everything you do will get you a score.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.320]   And China is implementing it.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   It is.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.960]   So they've been doing it in southern China.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.720]   But Beijing says now they're going to...
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.920]   This is a Bloomberg story.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.720]   The capital city will pool data from several departments to reward and punish some 22 million
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.000]   citizens based on their actions and reputations.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.320]   This is a plan posted on the Beijing Municipal Government's website Monday.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   Those with better social credit will get green channel benefits.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.200]   You're in the green channel.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.760]   All those who violate laws will find life or difficult.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.920]   And they make it...
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.320]   That sounds more innocuous even than it is.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.600]   Violate laws can mean things like mentioning Winnie the Pooh on social media.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.600]   Or...
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.600]   Because that was...
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   There was a message...
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.600]   There was a message...
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.760]   She was being compared to Winnie the Pooh.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.480]   So it's presumed if you mention Winnie the Pooh, there's a secret message.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.480]   That's right.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.480]   It's a dog whistle.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:02.040]   The laws themselves that if violated get you this social score are themselves objectionable.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:08.240]   Well, what I'm concerned is that we basically have this plan already in the United States.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   It's called Facebook.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   Everybody has this...
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   Yeah, but it's not run by the government.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.360]   Yes, but the minute we're at war with China...
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.360]   We'll turn it on.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.120]   And the government says, "Hey, the Chinese government has that.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.400]   We're the US government.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.280]   We need it too because it's a national emergency."
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.880]   You know, Zok, like hand it over.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.880]   They could.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.120]   The difference is we have an opposition political party and we have the first...
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   For now.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   So, well, I mean...
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.480]   But we do have a totalitarian regime ready to be turned on at a flip of the switch.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.160]   In other words, all the tools are there.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.720]   All the tools are there.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.960]   The social credit score has already been built.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.040]   I'm saying if you're a Democrat, Hagar, Republican and vice versa because essentially...
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040]   Yes, it's got to be.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040]   You've got to be in together.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:56.280]   One of the things that they are going to use this totalitarian technology dystopian system
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:02.760]   for is preventing an alternative political party from arising or people actually calling
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.640]   for democracy or things like that.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   So, yeah, these things...
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.520]   Right now, economically, and China's very forthright about it.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.120]   Hangzhou is doing it.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.560]   They've had a personal credit system.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.480]   They rolled it out earlier this year.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.560]   By the end of May, people with bad credit in China, according to the Chinese National Development
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.760]   and Reform Commission, have been blocked from booking more than 11 million flights and 4
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.160]   million high-speed train trips.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.160]   The Beijing Product Project...
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.000]   You get to go in the fast lane if you have a good credit score.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.120]   Otherwise, the Beijing Product will improve...
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.600]   Project will improve blacklist systems so that those deemed undrustworthy will quote,
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.200]   be unable to move even a single step according to the government's plan.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.640]   Think of human rights as if they could only be redeemed by frequent flyer miles.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.240]   That's basically what's going on.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.400]   Holy cow.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.480]   I think Jack Ma and Ali Baba are very much in the forefront of this.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:08.280]   For instance, Ali pays become the dominant commercial transaction method in China.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.840]   People don't...
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.240]   We're moving towards cashless societies.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.000]   If everything is digital, then everything is known.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.280]   Well, I think what is behind so much of this, and you see this in the rise of authoritarianism
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:24.720]   in the West as well, is in the end, people want to be comfortable.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.880]   They want food and clothing and shelter and maybe some creature comforts.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:35.520]   And what China is able to do is they have lifted so many people out of poverty and into
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.480]   a middle class and an upper class.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.760]   I believe the estimates are that the middle class in China, maybe in the next few years,
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.960]   will be the size of the entire population of the United States.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.760]   That's mind-boggling.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:53.320]   And there is a willingness among a lot of people to trade that comfort and not worry
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.600]   about the other aspects of social control that their government might give them.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   Yeah, they give them...
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   China is legit.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.920]   I mean, the idea...
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:07.320]   How many people have the totalitarian China saved from grinding poverty in the last 10
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   years?
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.560]   The communists have saved people from poverty by embracing capitalism and rejecting communism.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.560]   And now their new...
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.560]   The social and political control of the communist party is still very handy.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.240]   Right, and they're saying, "We're going to do capitalism in a new way."
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   No, thank you.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.360]   The United States, we're going to have totalitarian capitalism.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:31.200]   And I'm sure it will work pretty well for a while because if everybody just heads down
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.440]   and doing their job because they don't want to get a bad social score, I bet it will boost
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.440]   their economy.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.440]   It does, too.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.720]   The competitive will have to read these dumb articles that say, "Maybe the Chinese are
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   on to something.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.000]   Maybe it's impossible to have a democracy with a couple of billion people."
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.240]   This seems to be working.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.120]   And then, of course, it will turn into a reign of terror.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.560]   Democracy is ugly as sin.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.000]   Yeah, but so is Pol Pot, right?
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.720]   So it could get worse.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.840]   But the streets are clean and the rains are on.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.880]   And as the argument is, as long as people are comfortable, they may be willing to forego
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   democracy.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.880]   And that seems to be the...
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.560]   And not worry about the million Muslims that have been rounded up and put into re-education
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   camps.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.560]   But they're off as long as you're comfortable.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   West.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.800]   We don't have to pay attention to them.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   That's the real problem.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.400]   It's very easy to hide your head.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.400]   That was depressing.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.400]   That's good.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.040]   We're going to move on.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.200]   Listen, I got to talk about Russia.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.880]   China can't be fixed and they're a huge economic threat.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.880]   Interesting story.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   I really, I think it's...
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.400]   I don't know if it's clear what the answer is, especially to this whole Huawei thing.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.880]   I think that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.240]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.560]   Come back with more Adam Fisher is here, author of Valley of Genius, co-host on our Valley
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.560]   of Genius podcast.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.640]   If you haven't heard that yet, go to twit.tv/vog.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.840]   Mike Elgin, the digital nomad.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   He is...
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.600]   By the way, thank you for your gastronomad.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.880]   Lovely gastronomad.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.080]   That will mean handmade in France and that will open any bottle.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   Will open any bottle.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.720]   Unlike the last time you were here, when our cheap plastic Napa Valley wine bottle opener
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.720]   broke off.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.920]   Yeah, the French don't mess around with wine.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.920]   That's not going to happen.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   Nice.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.120]   It's even a little knife for cutting the foil.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   Oh, man.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   That's like a...
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.480]   You can put it right through the side of the corks to dense.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.480]   That's right.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.480]   Just chop it out.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.760]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.600]   This is that time of year when the post office is filled up with people.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.320]   Wonderful, happy, lovely people mailing out gifts and cards.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.880]   But if you do business, if you send out invoices or brochures, if you're an Etsy seller, eBay,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.160]   Amazon seller, and you do business through the post office, it may be not the happiest
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.800]   time of the year for you.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.560]   That means lines will be longer, parking will be hard, but we got a better.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.240]   I love the post office.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   I have a postal box.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   I love going there.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.200]   I'm saying hi to my local poster workers, but when it comes time to mail stuff, I print
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.640]   the stamps here with my computer, my printer, and stamps.com.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.200]   Buy and print official U.S. postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.560]   You've already got everything you need.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.080]   You don't need an expensive postage meter or fancy ink or anything.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.720]   Just your computer and your printer, the mail carrier, comes.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.240]   He picks it up.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.360]   You don't have to make a trip to the post office.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.720]   You get even though the holidays are the busiest time of the year at the post office, you don't
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.080]   have to worry about it.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.680]   You get the job done right from your desk.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.120]   It saves you money too, by the way.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.760]   You can get discounts at stamps.com that you can't get at the post office.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:49.120]   You never have to say every once in a while, I'll get a package with 23 stamps on it because
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.400]   they didn't want a postage due.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.760]   They didn't know exactly what it was.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.880]   They put too many.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.480]   You always print the exact right amount of postage every time because you get a scale.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.960]   A USB scale that goes right to the stamps.com interface.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.840]   They'll even suggest they'll say, "This could be a...
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   You save yourself some money.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.940]   Send this media mail."
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.100]   Things like that.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.480]   You get discounts on postage.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.400]   With all the time and money, you'll save stamps.com.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.840]   It's the best gift you can give yourself this holiday season.

[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   It fills in your...
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.720]   It will print right on an envelope, fill in your return address, your company logo.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.120]   It'll take the address from your address book.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.360]   If you're selling online, it'll fill out forms needed for certified mail or international
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.360]   mail automatically.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.160]   And also, by the way, it just looks a lot more professional.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.640]   You get that preprint.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   Everything's all printed out.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.640]   It's beautiful.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.200]   Enjoy the stamps.com surface with our special offer.

[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   high.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:12.520]   It's a little gift to you from all of us at stamps.com.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.160]   What is...
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.800]   I haven't asked you, Jason, because that seems like you see these stories a lot.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.280]   The Apple is backing off and producing phones.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.600]   The iPhone XR isn't selling well.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:33.960]   And then the weirdest story is that Apple is reportedly resuming iPhone X production
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.840]   because nobody's buying the XR.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.520]   Is that how credible is that?
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.520]   I think it's possible, although that's a weird one.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.840]   It's the journal again.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.680]   And again, I think there's something to these stories.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   At the same time, we saw these stories early this year where there were a lot of reports
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.760]   that Apple had cut back on orders from suppliers and it meant that the iPhone X was failing.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.640]   And that was wrong.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.120]   And that was wrong.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.200]   Basically, they seem to do major orders at the beginning and at some point they tail
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.200]   way off because they know they've got a peak sale period.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.480]   This is their response to the fact that they were selling out so fast on the first few weeks.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   Exactly right.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   They order a huge amount.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   So you drink out a bunch of them.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.480]   Because they don't want to be back any supply.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   Exactly.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.760]   And then you step down and they did it last year, as you said.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.680]   So we can't know for sure.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:26.280]   I do wonder if this is the first sign.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.200]   I was going to say clear sign, but it's not clear.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:35.080]   But it might be the first sign that Apple's strategy of dramatically increasing the average
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.280]   selling price of the iPhone is getting pushed back from consumers.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   Because if we think about the iPhone XR, that's the cheap iPhone this year.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.440]   And it is more expensive.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:50.160]   It is the cost basically of the plus phone a couple of years ago, which was the expensive
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.840]   version of the two iPhones that they made available.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.000]   And then above that, they've got the $9.99 and the $10.99.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.080]   So I wonder, especially in that story about putting the iPhone X back into production,
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.520]   if they're toying with the idea of coming in with some models with a little bit lower
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.560]   price tag, could they sell an iPhone X again for $8.99?
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.180]   They chose not to do that, right?
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.640]   In recent years, they've taken this year's phone.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.720]   And when it becomes last year's phone, they cut $100 off the price.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.280]   This year, they introduced the iPhone XS, the iPhone X vanished, right?
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   They're like, "We're not going to let you buy this for $8.99."
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   It's not even the list, is it?
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.280]   Right?
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.280]   Do they still sell on the iPhone 7?
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.280]   Exactly.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.280]   Does anybody want the iPhone 7?
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.280]   It's not a...
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.640]   I mean, the 8 is a better deal than the 7, even though it's a little more expensive.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.520]   And right now, that's the funny thing is that your best value buys for the iPhone are
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.480]   probably the iPhone 8 and then maybe the 10R.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.320]   The 10R, actually, if you're looking for a plus-size phone, that's a pretty good price.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   Maybe people want...
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.360]   They want to get rid of the home button.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.160]   They want the features of the 10...
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   It's also positive.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.160]   ...where the 10S.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:55.640]   And the other story might be, the Wall Street Journal says, "It may also be that Apple has
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.360]   contracts with Samsung for a certain number of OLED displays."
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.840]   Remember, the 10 is the first one with an OLED display.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.600]   And they need to buy a certain number of panels from Samsung and given that they're
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.640]   not selling the 10S or the 10S Max that well, maybe they're going to go back to making more
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.640]   of the 10s.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   Right.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:17.280]   And then they go in with that lower price point after the initial bang of 10S sales.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:23.920]   I mean, this is all tea leaf reading because the Apple supply chain has contracts and it
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.560]   has specific issues.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.360]   And how do they get these parts?
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.920]   And they want to make sure that they can hit their peak and not be really back-ordered.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.800]   So we try to understand maybe what it means, but you don't necessarily know enough to know
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   for sure.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.440]   There's another interpretation that nobody wants a cheaper iPhone, that everybody wants
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.280]   the top of the line model.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.920]   I like that one.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.520]   Apple likes that interpretation.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:54.120]   If you either want the best, in which case you get one of the top of the line models
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:37:00.080]   from Apple and you spend a fortune for it, or you get a one plus phone or something like
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.480]   that and it costs 300 bucks or whatever, but nobody wants to spend $900 for the worst
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   iPhone.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.400]   I mean, it's too much money for the thing that's not the best thing.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.400]   It's a good phone and everything's like, "Oh!"
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:20.680]   I mean, I think Apple is very smart to say, "Hey, okay, every time we make a more expensive
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.400]   model, we sell it."
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.920]   So why don't we keep doing that?
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.480]   And we'll still make that less expensive model available.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.160]   It's kind of made up for a drop in unit sales.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.160]   Exactly.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.000]   Or it's flat, basically, in unit sales.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.760]   But Wall Street still wants to see growth.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.600]   So they've stopped reporting sales figures now going forward.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.960]   They're not going to report their sales figures.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.960]   Only the revenue figure.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.000]   That's a little bit telling.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.440]   And I do think that they are looking at money left on the table that if somebody will buy
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:51.400]   an iPhone for $1,000 or $1,200 or $1,500, why would they not make that sale available?
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.440]   The question is, what happens on the low end?
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.360]   And I do wonder about the psychology of like the 10R, I think it's a really good phone and
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.280]   I think it's a really good value.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.200]   But if you're looking for a bargain, maybe you're not buying an Apple product after all.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:13.680]   And I also wonder if the public isn't being subtly manipulated into demand for the iPhone
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.200]   10 because the iPhone 10, because they've been manufacturing it for a while, it gets
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.560]   more and more profitable over time if you don't lower the price because you've already invested
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.600]   in all the infrastructure on the manufacturing side.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.360]   And so that's really kind of the best phone for them to be selling from a--
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.600]   But I'm looking at Apple's website.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.760]   I see a 7, an 8, a 10R.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.760]   Yeah, the 10 is not currently for sale.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.760]   They took it off sale.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.840]   So would it re-enter or would it re-enter in certain markets?
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   Maybe it's for Japan, China.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.560]   It would be a little bit weird for them to do it, but I wouldn't put it past them to say,
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.560]   "Hey, great news.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.800]   People love that iPhone 10 and we're going to make it available for a class price."
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.360]   And if the margins have come down, yeah, because in the end, Apple doesn't look at
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.720]   these things and look at the prices.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.280]   They do for marketing purposes.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.560]   But in terms of what their plan, they're looking at what margin they get out of everyone
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.720]   they sell and if they can make more money on an iPhone 10 sale than on a 10S sale, great.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.720]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   I'm still waiting for the iPhone 9.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.320]   I feel like that's going to be like Windows 9.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.320]   It's never going to happen.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   Never going to happen.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   It's about 9.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.880]   Skip it.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.880]   It's probably unlucky in China or somewhere.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.880]   I don't know.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.440]   It's probably like the 13th floor.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.080]   There's probably some cultural reason you would skip mine.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.400]   If the fact that Microsoft and Apple both did that, right?
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.480]   Or maybe it means no in German.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.480]   9!
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   I forget the 9.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.480]   9!
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   9!
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.160]   I want to lose a German market.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:38.760]   Speaking of the German market, Google is facing some more trouble in Europe, in Germany, in
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.760]   Spain.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   They've already gone through this.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.640]   The "Lektzun" I can't say it.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.320]   I got to get Jeff Jarvis to say it.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.120]   Zichrecht or something.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:53.080]   There was the "Link" tax and it was proposed first in Germany and it failed miserably.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:59.840]   Then they tried it in Spain and Spanish news organizations found such a drop off of traffic
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:07.200]   that the problem is that publishers say when you do a Google search for a story, Google
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:13.560]   will put our headline and a snippet, a sentence or two from that story in there in the search
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.800]   results.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:20.280]   And their contention is Google should pay us for that when Germany and Spain tried it
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.440]   didn't work out so well.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.840]   No, in Germany, I believe what happened was that all of the major publishers made a deal
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:29.320]   with Google to license their links for free because in the end, they want the traffic.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.920]   In fact, there's some evidence that the snippet helps drive traffic.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.320]   Yeah, this seems like a solution to something that is not a problem or at least that the
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.080]   publishers have accepted is the way that it works.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.480]   They just actually bring us mad at Google.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:47.760]   I like what Sorrow said the other day, which I don't know if it was at Davos, but he basically
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:53.600]   said, "Oh, you know, Europe is just going to find ways to tax the big Silicon Valley
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.600]   for us."
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   That's what's happening.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:01.000]   And it's not going to ever end.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.160]   According to Soros' analysis, and he seems like a pretty smart guy, this is going to
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.160]   hobble.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.840]   Fang, Facebook, Apple.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.960]   Well, that's the question.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.040]   Who gives first, Europe, or the big tech giants?
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.040]   Who blinks?
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.520]   Well, this is the title 11 or whatever.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:24.160]   And there's also the other one, 13, which is the copyright issues, which Google has
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.600]   started an entire campaign about because that threatens YouTube.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.600]   So tell me about it.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.240]   So this is both part of the new European copyright law, is that it?
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.240]   Yeah, yeah, it's a copyright regime.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.080]   So Article 11 is the link tax?
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   I think that's it.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.600]   And then Article 13, what is that?
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:47.080]   13 is basically it says you as YouTube are responsible for copyright infringement on
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.080]   your site.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:52.400]   And as we know from, I believe, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States,
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.760]   there's this safe harbor provision, the idea that if they take steps to tell the users,
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.000]   the users are responsible.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.160]   And then they need to take some steps to moderate and to flag them.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.800]   And they've set up content ID for YouTube, which patrols against copyright.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.080]   It will also kick off anything that's fair use on YouTube.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.560]   You'll get your videos hijacked by other people who chop up your video, repost it,
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.560]   claim copyright on it.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.560]   There are lots of flaws.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:19.880]   But what YouTube says is that isn't even workable under this new copyright regime in
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.520]   the EU, that they would actually need to, I mean, what they're threatening is pull the
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:30.480]   plug on YouTube in the EU because they can't be liable for every single act of an upload
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.160]   to their service of infringing content, especially since a lot of content.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.160]   People don't agree on who owns it.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.800]   So but it is coming.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:45.760]   I, I, and, you know, of course, all the technologies companies are going to say, there is no technological
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   solution.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   It can't be done.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.760]   Okay.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.360]   So whether that's true or not, I don't know.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:43:00.760]   But what really surprised me is I saw a lecture by Neil Ferguson, who's a historian, but importantly,
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.560]   a right, a libertarian, right historian.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.720]   And he said, you know, regulation is coming.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.600]   You know, he's a UK citizen or was until a couple of weeks ago.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:15.400]   And now he's also a USA citizenship, but he said, it's coming.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:21.000]   And what we really need to do is repeal section 230 of the communications decency act, which
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.480]   is this, you know, take down the safe harbor.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.480]   The safe harbor.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   Safe harbor.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.960]   And say because, and you know, that's what this would do is repeal safe harboring you.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:38.960]   So when you see it coming from every political angle, a kind of leftist European angle,
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:45.360]   anti corporate and, you know, and, and, and the libertarian point of view.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.560]   It's, and, and Soros is saying it like the argument to be made here is that there are
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.480]   lots of laws about the internet that were built because we didn't want to kill the internet
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.280]   when it was being born.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.600]   And now it's way past being born.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.200]   And we look at some of these businesses that have been built up on the lax restrictions,
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.960]   these kind of freebies that they were given so that they didn't die.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.760]   So YouTube could exist, right?
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:11.400]   And now we're saying, yeah, you can't skate by it like this anymore.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:17.000]   I do wonder how Google, I mean, because you talked to a YouTube creator and like content
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.440]   ID is brutal even now, like creators who are not giant media corporations are endlessly
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.920]   getting their videos demonetized.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.680]   Other people get the money for their ads or they get pulled off because of things that
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.920]   are totally wrong.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.640]   And if that's not good enough for the EU, it starts to, you start to wonder, well, what
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   is it going to be?
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:41.160]   Now, the answer is they could hire people and they could not only hire moderators, but
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.720]   they could also invest in more technology there.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.720]   They don't want to do that.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.360]   Imagine how many people you'd have to hire.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.360]   They don't want to ruin it.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   It's 100 hours a minute or uploaded to YouTube.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.720]   Well, I mean, I don't think humans could do it, right?
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.880]   Which would mean they would need to do more technology.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.840]   And I get the, there's this part of this argument that is like, no, no, no, it's impossible.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.000]   Or maybe it's possible what we don't want to do it.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.440]   Like that's part of their argument here.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.440]   It's possible.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   It's probably very expensive.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.240]   The regulators don't care if there's only a limited number of media outlets feeding into
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.720]   these huge networks.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.760]   In fact, it's probably the plan.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.400]   You know, we need to limit speech so that we have a center, a political center, you
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.280]   know, it also makes Google completely vulnerable, right?
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.240]   Because it basically is a sort of Damocles hovering over them at all times.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.920]   Like, we could get you for so much copyright infringement if we wanted to at any Google's
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.840]   argument is it's their competitors who can't survive the shopping sites and so forth.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.000]   They can't survive anyway who are just using this in any competitive way to talk the
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.600]   EU into shutting us down.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.240]   That there isn't really a problem here.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.640]   And I think that the link text is a good example.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.920]   It isn't a problem, right?
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.520]   Google's driving traffic to these sites.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.280]   There's no reason that they should be charged for use of the snippets.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.800]   It's good for the sites.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.240]   It's good for Google, but it's a it's an anti competitive wedge.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.680]   I mean, the argument would be that current business models say it's fine for everybody,
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.880]   but in a different business model, Google, Google, which is one of the most successful
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.200]   and profitable businesses.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   Right.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.560]   Is the one who's controlling access to media companies that have been struggling for a
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.880]   couple of decades now.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.640]   So you could make the argument that the solution here should be that some of that money that
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.640]   Google makes in being the place you search for news should get kicked back to the publishers.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:27.600]   I get what they're coming from, but that would break like how the whole businesses evolve.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   Exactly.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:33.720]   But so if so if okay, so maybe Google can't filter properly, but I bet Google could figure
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.400]   out a micro payment system that would work at it, you know, a hundredth of a penny.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.520]   Wishing one sentence, maybe two from an article to help you find the right article.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   Right.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.920]   But they're also building a business around being the indispensable directory of all
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   news, right?
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.360]   What should they should they start a competitor?
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.240]   What I mean, they're doing their job.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.960]   There's the thing that bugs me.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.400]   There's a huge disconnect between the political culture in Europe and the public of Europe.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.120]   The reason it's such a big problem in Europe is that the people of Europe choose Google
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.120]   as a voluntary choice.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.360]   It actually doesn't have a monopoly here.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.360]   It does in Europe.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.360]   Exactly.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.120]   The other thing is that there's a political culture in Europe where they just really like
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.320]   the 19th century.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.320]   That was a great century.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.400]   All the buildings that they convene in are all these.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.440]   It's a very 19th century.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:25.680]   And so and this whole internet is just a big problem, which they seem to this is my opinion
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.560]   of somebody who spends a lot of time in Europe.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.200]   They seem to be trying to, we haven't damaged the internet enough.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   It's still coming at us.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.080]   We need to we need to knock it down some more.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:39.360]   Because everybody at this table spends all day opening links, opening tabs, reading things,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.960]   reading articles, try doing that in Europe.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:42.960]   I dare you.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.200]   It's the nightmare every week.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.560]   We know to use cookies.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   This cookie page.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.560]   I see this.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.920]   We all see this now.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:54.160]   There's a perfect example of an EU regulation that has a complete opposite effect.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.880]   It in it inured everybody to the notion of cookies.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.480]   Now it's just like, yeah, close that, close that, close that.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.720]   Nobody's reading the stuff.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.200]   And the other thing you're not reading is any US paper.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.520]   Oh, the LA Times, every US paper, they're like, I'm sorry.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.480]   The Jew doesn't let us open this.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.160]   You know, so I'm like, so this is nice.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.320]   This ties back to the Huawei story in this sense.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:18.400]   I think the biggest risk to the world is a siloization or building walls between regions
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.680]   and countries so that there's a European internet.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.680]   There's a Chinese internet.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.760]   It's American internet.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:29.000]   There's a European telecommunications companies, Chinese companies, American companies, and
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.120]   nobody buys from anybody else.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.480]   That is a recipe.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.560]   And I think we've seen it before for world war and utter disaster.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.600]   I don't think that's the way to go.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.400]   We've been moving towards a global system.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.800]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.560]   Obviously there's birthing pains.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.800]   That's what we're seeing here.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:54.320]   But a big mistake would be for countries to shut down something because it's America.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.560]   But China did that.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.120]   They did the Great Firewall of China, which essentially locked out.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120]   But it's great for China.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.120]   Is it?
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:08.520]   Yes, because the only giant companies that could...
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.240]   There's no Amazon in China.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.240]   There's Alibaba.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.240]   Exactly.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.240]   You're a Facebook in China.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.720]   Google in China is Baidu.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.720]   Exactly.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.160]   And those are the only companies that have kind of are significant outside of the United
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.160]   States.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.160]   I agree with you.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.160]   It works.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.160]   That's why we got to lobby against it.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.600]   The EU wanted to have some tech companies.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.160]   Well, then they do the Great Firewall of the EU.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.720]   And I guarantee you that the European Google...
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.000]   Yes, I think that's where we're headed because it makes a lot of sense if you're trying to
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.040]   maximize the importance of your own country, like China is doing.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:56.160]   So if France wanted to be more relevant, they'd create a firewall, suffer a few years.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:02.560]   But of information poverty, but pretty soon they'd have their own pretty vital...
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.120]   There's a French search engine.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.120]   Pretty vital search engine.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.760]   Nobody uses it.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.160]   And everybody would use it.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:14.400]   And it might be able, like these Chinese companies are now able, might be able to go toe to toe
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.640]   with these American companies.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:24.120]   So, you know, there's this, you know, Woodrow Wilson sense in which we need to be more connected
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.440]   to stop world war.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.800]   You know, we stop world war.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.520]   And that's what I hear you saying, Leo, but, you know, we're already in a kind of world,
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.440]   cyber war right now.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.800]   That's why, you know, the American government is saying, don't use Chinese phones.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:46.480]   That's why the Russian hacking scandal was such a huge deal.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.840]   So this more connected means less problems idea is...
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.160]   I think it's crumbling.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:51:02.280]   You need to use Walla, which is the French Google Walla.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.880]   But do you really want to see a world where if you're in France, you use Walla, if you're
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.000]   in the US, you use Google, if you're in Chinese, you buy do?
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.400]   I mean, when I'm France, I read Lamont.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.960]   And when I'm in the UK, I read the economist.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.560]   I can see from an economic point of view, countries might want to do that.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:23.280]   And then from an economic point of view, I mean, it's clearly more efficient to have
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:30.920]   one monopoly power or one monopoly company serve everybody, but it's also more brittle.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:39.920]   You know, if you want a robust worldwide system, maybe you actually want overlapping
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.920]   and markets.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:47.240]   I'm probably in the minority, but I'd love to see the mini-tell make a big return.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.320]   I used to have a mini-tell.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.680]   Somebody brought us a mini-tell.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:55.360]   This was before there was the internet, there were little terminals that were put in homes
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.720]   in France to replace the phone book, but it ended up you could play games, you could chat.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.200]   It was an early social network.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   Yep.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.200]   They may have to go back to that.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.880]   So Google has a campaign that they're doing called Save Your Internet that is specifically
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:13.480]   targeted at the EU about article 11 and 13, both.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:18.080]   And one of the things that struck me that was interesting is there's very much a, you
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:22.280]   wouldn't like something bad to happen to your favorite YouTubers aspect to it.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:28.680]   If you click on the FAQ, it mentions some European-based YouTubers, including Kritzka
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:32.160]   Sacht and CGP Grey.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:35.600]   And it's very much like you would be sad if they disappeared from YouTube.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.200]   And I thought, well, I know, I know Gray.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:45.280]   It's like, do you know that Google's basically saying, using you, you could lose this guy
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:49.600]   and he could lose his entire business and livelihood if this thing passes.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.240]   But that's what they're definitely trying to scare people into writing to their members
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.240]   of the European Parliament.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   It's really not that scary.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.240]   That's not scary.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   Losing CGP Grey.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   Losing CGP Grey.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.280]   No, I would be sad because those are really good videos.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.120]   But like- We wouldn't even be losing him.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.320]   He would be losing money.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.680]   That's like- Well, yeah, but the argument is that if you're a YouTube user in the EU,
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.120]   they're basically they're saying, we will unplug YouTube if this happens, which I don't
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.600]   believe for a second.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.120]   But that's what they're trying to do because they want to create a fewer here to get the
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:20.720]   laws to be changed before they go into a- I guess they vote again in January in the
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.160]   European Parliament about these.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.960]   Yeah, this is not- We should point out this directory.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.480]   Directive of copyright is not at law.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.960]   I think January they do a vote.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:34.280]   Apparently well supported though by members of the EU Parliament.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.040]   So download those videos now.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.040]   Cash those on your hard drive.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:44.080]   I think we're- I'm surprised that we have kind of one internet still actually.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.680]   I've been thinking that would break up.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.760]   Do you think we're in a- We're kind of in a temporary utopia and that soon we're going
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.920]   to revert to the- Oh, I absolutely do.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.760]   Oh, how sad.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:00.560]   It's that same little lull when I talked about how we had the laws that encourage the Internet.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.040]   It's like, oh, the Internet, it's fun.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.040]   Let's do this.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.440]   And now everybody's like, oh my God, it's incredibly powerful and important.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   We need to own it now.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.000]   That's the argument by the way against that neutrality is- Oh, we could have it.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.120]   We could have neutrality, but now that everybody's mature, we should really-
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   We take it over.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.120]   Take it over.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.400]   Didn't Tim Wu say that in the kill switch.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:22.000]   That was his whole premise was just as in the early days of long distance telephony.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.520]   There were- I didn't know this, but there were a lot of long distance companies in the
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.120]   turn of the century, last century.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.280]   But as soon as it became profitable, AT&T said, no, we'll take this.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   We'll take it from here.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.280]   Lockdown.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.240]   And then Bell Labs effectively became an arm of the government.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:39.400]   And a built-in spy network for the intelligence services.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.360]   Read all about it in Valley of Genius available bookstores.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.360]   Is that cynical?
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.360]   No.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.360]   No.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.360]   That's a fact.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   Okay.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   Bell Labs became the R&D division of Bell, right?
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.360]   Right.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.360]   And then how did the government take it over?
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.600]   I don't remember that part.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:02.920]   Well, whenever- So I read the history of Bell Labs.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:08.520]   I forget he's an editor at Popular Mechanics who wrote it.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.000]   But anyway, I read it.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.040]   And it was very interesting every time.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:20.920]   So AT&T was essentially granted a monopoly by the United States.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:26.520]   And Bell Labs, like when they couldn't figure out something with the bomb, they'd call up
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:31.640]   Bell Labs and get their hottest researchers to help the government figure out some top
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.920]   secret project.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   So that was one way.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:40.200]   And then the other thing was whenever the national security apparatus needed to tap
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   someone's phones, well, Bell Labs was right there to help- or Bell, not Bell Labs was
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   right there to help them.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.400]   Are you talking about Douglas Koupland?
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   No.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.600]   I'm talking Bell AT&T.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:54.520]   And then it became loosened.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.040]   Well, then it was broken up by the antitrust.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:02.240]   You know, Tim Wu would really love that because that's the analogy.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:07.240]   He's reaching for with Google and all that.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:18.520]   But yeah, AT&T was in bed with the United States and it was no secret for its-
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.440]   Because they're a good American company.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.440]   Exactly.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.440]   Well, I mean-
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.040]   In those days, and maybe even these days, if you're an American company, you should
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.040]   support America.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.040]   To play ball.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.040]   Play ball, you know.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.200]   If the CIA comes in knocking, you say, "Yes, sir."
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.200]   And now-
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.160]   Come on, let's set up a room in the switch here in San Francisco.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:42.040]   And now Google, you know, takes the exact officer approach.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.920]   No, we don't want to cooperate with Apple.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   And Apple and everybody-
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.240]   No, why?
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.640]   Because they're global companies, right?
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:50.640]   And they don't-
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:55.200]   They seem to cooperate pretty well with China when China says, "Oh, let's move all the iCloud
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   servers to China."
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.560]   They say, "Okay."
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.560]   And they say, "Oh, let's censor some of those apps.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.840]   We don't want to know VPNs in China, okay?"
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.600]   Yeah, I don't trust any of them.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.840]   They're a good Chinese company.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:13.360]   Actually multinational is a good company in whatever country they're operating in.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.400]   The problem is when you get a conflict.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.120]   The problem is that it's the different rules in different countries.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.120]   Right.
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:21.760]   So if you want to do something that the government-
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.040]   There is no US government.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.280]   It's lots of people who disagree with each other and you just pick a side.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:31.440]   You buy some lobbyists and you win the political battle or you muddle it or whatever.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.680]   In China, it's like, "Okay, if you don't play ball with us, you're out."
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   You're out.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.680]   So it's a different thing.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:42.520]   So you kind of- You either cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party or you don't do
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.820]   business in China.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.820]   Those are the two options.
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:45.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.120]   The book I was referring to is The Idea Factory.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.120]   Oh, I read that.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.120]   That was great.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.120]   Was it good?
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.120]   You remember?
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.120]   What a good book.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.320]   It's the "The Age of America Innovation."
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.280]   And of course, UNIX came out of Bell Labs.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   See, did.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:04.240]   I mean, there was a really fertile place.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.160]   Remember the AT&T picture phone?
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.920]   1964?
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.160]   The World's Fair?
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.160]   You don't remember that.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.160]   I remember that.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.160]   I saw it.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.400]   AT&T commercials where it's like someday, you'll send a fax from the beach.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.400]   You will.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.400]   That's right.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   It's right.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   I want to do that.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.920]   That was a great- The transistor came out of Bell Labs.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:23.920]   That's right.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   Sure.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:29.440]   It didn't -- what's the law about information?
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.440]   Moors?
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.160]   No, that wasn't too.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.480]   I don't think laws came out of Bell Labs.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   I'm going to get it off the edge.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   I'm going to get it off the edge.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.080]   I think inventions came out of Bell Labs.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.720]   And let's not forget, says Blake, the glowing orb.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.320]   I don't remember that at all.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.800]   Is that the one that the president was talking about?
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.800]   Yeah, they have it in Saudi Arabia now.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.800]   Saudi Arabia.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.800]   Claude Shannon.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.800]   Claude Shannon's law.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   Claude Shannon's law.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.800]   Very good.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.800]   You're right.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   I'm out.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:55.800]   Right there.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   Very good, Dr. Morbius.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.800]   Thank you, Dr. Morbius.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.800]   Very impressive.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.800]   All right.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:03.320]   I've got to find something a little less dystopian to talk about.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:04.320]   Yeah, we're getting --
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.720]   It's the way it is lately.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.720]   I have to tell you.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.720]   It is.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.720]   Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.720]   Yeah, happy Thanksgiving.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.800]   We'll talk about Black Friday.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   Oh, boy.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   That's happy.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.520]   That's a little late, dude.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.520]   In just a bit.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.560]   A third of online purchases Black Friday came from phone.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.480]   People calling each other's eyes out.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.480]   They're getting better.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.520]   It was almost ten years ago that a Walmart employee was trampled at a Black Friday.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.800]   Hasn't happened lately, has it?
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.040]   You can thank your iPhone for that.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.600]   That's right.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.600]   People aren't going anymore.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.600]   They're just doing it online.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.760]   You can't get trampled on your iPhone.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:45.240]   Our show today brought to you by my dinner.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:48.200]   Sunday's Blue Apron Day around the LaPort household.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:55.000]   Blue Apron makes cooking fun by delivering fresh, seasonally inspired, pre-portion ingredients
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.760]   and step-by-step recipes right to your door.
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.560]   Sure, you could have turkey hash tonight.
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.360]   But why not make something different and fresh and delicious?
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.520]   Whether you're looking for quick and easy meals or a full cooking experience, Blue Apron
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.080]   lets you choose from a range of recipe options.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:15.600]   Every week at least three recipes are built with your busy schedule in mind.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.600]   So they're easy.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   They're quick.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.840]   They're still prep even.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.960]   The sauces, the spices, the ingredients all prepared.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.720]   You can get rid of your grocery list.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.280]   Let Blue Apron not only get the ingredients, but prep them for you and cook dinner in as
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.120]   little as 20 minutes.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.760]   And then they have recipes for people like me who like to take our time and spend some
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.280]   more energy and come up with some wild stuff.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.560]   I love my Blue Apron.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.760]   I look for, get out of your cooking rut and experience the joy of new recipes like smoky
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.520]   chicken and sweet potato bake with cheesy cornbread biscuits.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.520]   Mmm.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   Mmm.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.080]   Hardy vegetable grain bough with avocado and creamy fig dressing.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.240]   Yes, they have vegetarian dishes that are to die for.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.240]   You'll love them.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.920]   They got meat too.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   Homestyle beef medallions and maple pan sauce with mashed potatoes and garlic sauteed kale.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.120]   Even somebody from Toronto would like that.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   Hot Italian sausage pizza with roasted peppers and all of this.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.960]   What you do is you go to Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.600]   Check out this week's menu.

[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.000]   Cajun style spice chicken.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.560]   Oh, this looks so good.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.480]   Oh man.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:33.000]   The thing is I always get new ideas, new ingredients, new tips and it's so easy and
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.640]   there's no waste because you get exactly what you need to make that dish no more, no less.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.440]   Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.040]   Your first three meals are free.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.760]   Blue Apron is a better way to cook.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   I have to remember what we're cooking tonight.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.320]   I can't remember.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.840]   I know it's fun because I get home.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840]   I'm tired after Twit.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:52.840]   I don't have to shop.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.840]   I just go home.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.640]   I'll whip out an amazing deal.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.640]   Half an hour.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.640]   Typically.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.840]   Depends because they have this two different things.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.880]   So somewhere as fast as 20 minutes, somewhere 40 minutes.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.400]   Depends what you get, but you get to choose ahead of time.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.040]   Just meal any dinner.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.960]   It's practically that, but I like to cook them because there are services.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.560]   We shall not mention their names that they're basically TV dinners.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560]   They're done.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.560]   You microwave them.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.560]   I don't want them.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.560]   Subscribe to an airline.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560]   Like is airline food by mail.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.560]   Airline food by mail.com.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.560]   I bet it exists.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.360]   I bet it does, but I don't want it.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360]   This way it's fresh.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]   Blue Apron.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360]   It smells great.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360]   It's wonderful.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.360]   All right.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.720]   Did you guys look at the rundown and pick something good?
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.200]   How about Black Friday?
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.520]   We're a third of online sales on Friday.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.400]   We're from phones.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.800]   This is a big, big jump.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.640]   This is a lot of this comes from Adobe.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.080]   I don't know why, but Adobe Analytics, they get all the information.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.440]   I don't know how.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.360]   A third of online sales were on smartphones on Black Friday.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.840]   That's up from 29% a year earlier.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.520]   2.1 billion in sales.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:07.800]   A leap from the previous record, 1.4 billion which was last Cyber Monday.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.080]   When can we retire the term Cyber Monday, right?
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.680]   That was before you could shop on your phone.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.280]   You had to wait till work open because that's where the computer was.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.760]   It did your shopping, right?
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.560]   That's the point of Cyber Monday.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:27.480]   Now it's a totally meaningless term.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:33.280]   We also have to retire the word Friday because Black Friday now begins on Thanksgiving or
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280]   before.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280]   It's Black Thursday.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.560]   In fact, there was a huge amount of sales on Thanksgiving.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.600]   People were buying on Thanksgiving.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.240]   Even Google had a big sale starting on Thanksgiving morning.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:50.960]   Online sales for Black Friday, 6.22 billion according to Analytics, that's up 23%.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.160]   23% growth year over year.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.480]   This kind of proves that the phone is the platform now and that all of us on computers
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.600]   are just dinosaurs.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:11.080]   Top selling devices, laptops, streaming devices like Roku, Chromecast and Fire TV.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   Top selling video games, Red Dead Redemption 2, Let's Go Pikachu and God of War.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.600]   Thanksgiving Day itself $3.7 billion in sales.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.840]   Thanksgiving Day, eat the turkey, go shopping.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.320]   I think that is a big shift.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:41.240]   If you count all November, $38 billion in online sales in the month.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:45.120]   Cyber Monday, which doesn't exist according to Adam.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.640]   I'm just saying it's an antique and should be retired.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.240]   People are expected to grow 17% on cyber Monday.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.800]   CNET should retire that word.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.480]   Is it CNET that came up with that?
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.480]   No, I think that goes.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.320]   They're using it.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:01.120]   It's like, no, I think it's Adobe Analytics.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:06.080]   Then there's Giving Tuesday and there's what you're going to buy Wednesday.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   Small business Saturday.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.760]   Small business Saturday.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.880]   Throw your money at me Thursday.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.000]   What the F Wednesday?
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.080]   What the F Wednesday?
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.840]   The one place wasn't too busy.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.840]   Sears.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:21.840]   Sears.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:28.640]   This picture from a Sears store in White Plains, New York on Black Friday, the refrigerator
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:33.640]   section absolutely empty.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.680]   The inside, this is a great story from CNBC.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.800]   The inside of Sears at the Galleria White Plains Mall on Black Friday.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.680]   No one's there.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.440]   Mostly the same as it has for the past few years.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:53.400]   Yellow tags, highlighted doorbuster sales, rows of washers and dryers stood gleaming.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:06:00.480]   Sparkling Christmas ornaments were on display, but the glaring omission at 7am an hour after
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.920]   opening were the shoppers.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.960]   This place looks like a ghost town, noted Brandon Warkethin, who made the trip to White
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.560]   Plains to Sears and White Plains from the Bronx.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:16.560]   That looks like a ghost.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.080]   It's a waste to even come out.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.320]   They're not really changing the prices.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:27.760]   He's from the Bronx, but he came via Texas.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.760]   I see.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.760]   I can't switch gears that fast.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:35.200]   As soon as I saw the Bronx, I realized it made a poor choice.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.520]   Who is the reporter who said, "I am going to do like a place about the years on Black
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.040]   Friday and how no one's there.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   I'm going to..."
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:47.160]   Here's a picture of the front of the Sears stores where buyers are waiting to get in.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.400]   There's one person, but I think she's the one taking the picture.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.960]   That is.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.760]   This is a high level.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.920]   We shouldn't gloat.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.440]   We shouldn't gloat.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.920]   Just the kind of craftsmanship, media craftsmanship.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920]   You know what?
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.760]   I'm going to send a reporter to Sears on Black Friday.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.760]   White Plains.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.760]   You've got the Sad Trumbone store.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   Yes.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.120]   You just sent someone who can really...
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.680]   Look at the craftsman tool sets just waiting to fly off the shelves.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.600]   If anybody would just smart that advertise it as no waiting.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600]   No waiting.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.000]   No crying.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.480]   So Cyber Monday as a phrase was invented in Thanksgiving 2005.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.640]   That's because when the internet first started.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.840]   I think Regis Philbin coined the term.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.640]   Actually, that's right.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.440]   There's the Christmas tree aisle.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.240]   Lauren, we just walked around with her camera phone trying to find shoppers.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.240]   Amazing.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.240]   Here's another section with no people.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.360]   Oh my God.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.040]   This actually is kind of sad.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.040]   I mean...
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.480]   Why are you sad to see Sears?
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.480]   No.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.480]   Prices are good though.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.480]   That's a down jacket for...
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.480]   Ten dollars for...
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.480]   It's a doorbuster.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.880]   That's ten dollars for a down jacket.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.120]   It's a sale still going on.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.120]   I'll go to White Plains.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.880]   I should have checked out.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.600]   You go to China or you go to Sears.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.920]   But you know, it's funny because didn't Jeff Bezos this week say that someday Amazon
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.920]   will be a fail?
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.920]   Yes.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.920]   We'll go away.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.920]   And...
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:18.920]   And it does.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:19.920]   It happens.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.920]   This is what happened.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:25.480]   Sears was the Amazon of the turn of the last century.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:29.200]   I was in Chicago recently and we took one of those architecture boat tours and one of the
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.200]   highlights of it was this massive complex on the Chicago River that was built from Montgomery
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.040]   Ward by the Montgomery Ward.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:42.160]   And that is a fascinating story because that mail order retail dominated.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:46.880]   It had huge impacts in society because there were people who weren't allowed in stores,
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.120]   especially African Americans who could order products on the Sears...
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.440]   Or the Montgomery Ward and then later the Sears catalogs.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   Of course, Montgomery Ward.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.960]   It's out of business.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.560]   There's .com companies in all those buildings.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.560]   But it's...
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.120]   There's these enormous buildings built on the side of the Chicago River.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120]   Huge.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:11.200]   One of the largest buildings in square footage ever built at the time for a company that
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:16.000]   people below a certain age don't even know the name because it went out of business in
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.840]   the '90s, I think.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.480]   My people call it Monkey Ward.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.480]   Monkey Ward's.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480]   Yeah, sure.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.480]   And those days are over.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.480]   My people are over.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.480]   People of a certain age.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.480]   Yes.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.280]   The first internet was the railroad and the post, you know.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   Right.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:33.920]   And then they got the railbarons and they had to do legislation to break them up, right?
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920]   I actually give credit to...
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.920]   Pretty similar.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:36.920]   ...to the Bazel.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:40.600]   This was at an all hands meeting and they asked him about Sears.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:44.200]   And which filed for bankruptcy in October.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:49.520]   And Bazel said, "Look, that's going to happen to us unless we obsess over customers."
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.520]   So he's just...
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.520]   It's just...
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.520]   You've got to work harder because we're still a startup even though we're Amazon, so work
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.520]   harder.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.760]   Amazon is not too big to fail.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.480]   He said, "In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.000]   Amazon will build bankrupt.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.480]   If you look at large companies, their life spans tend to be 30 plus years, not 100 plus
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   years."
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.480]   So Sears is a great exception.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.480]   It's a great success story.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.040]   Let me tell you, Amazon is not going to fail because people aren't working hard, right?
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.480]   It's going to fail because somebody's going to invent the thing that's better than Amazon.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   Right.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.480]   Amazon won't...
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.480]   Right.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.480]   It's the same old story, right?
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.480]   So this is...
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.480]   The matter transmitter.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480]   Someone's working in it now.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   And a garage.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.480]   And so Jeff Bezos to say, you know, if you have to go to the bathroom, do you have your jar
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.480]   handing?
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480]   Now get back to work everybody.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.480]   Come on, Jeff.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.480]   Come on.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:35.480]   So cards against humanity did a 99% off sale.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.480]   They did.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480]   They did.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.480]   They've spent the last few months.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.480]   I know those guys.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:43.640]   They spent the last few months collecting a bizarre collection of products and then put
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.800]   them all on sale, individual items, single items for 99% off.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.040]   So you could get like a car for $90.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.040]   Now, $4.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040]   So you have to...
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.040]   2015, I mean, it's not the latest.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.040]   No, it's a used car.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.040]   It's a used car.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.040]   They had $197.50.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.040]   So...
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:00.800]   There's a Picasso lithograph signed.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800]   That's right.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.040]   It's an MFing car.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.040]   This car's got it all.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.520]   Seats, wheels, cup holders, you name it.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.560]   Drive it to work or just make it go beep beep.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.720]   So what you had to do is you had to wait for the countdown to go down to the bottom.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.400]   Then you had to click buy and you had to as quickly as you had to fill in a capture,
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.640]   as quickly as you could get to the next screen, put in your credit card information.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.760]   And basically one person would get it and everybody else would lose.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760]   This is a great price.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:29.320]   And according to Max Timken of cards against humanity, they basically did a denial of service
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.440]   attack on every single provider they were using.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440]   Of captures.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:38.120]   Whether it was their web service provider, Stripe, their shopping cart provider, they
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.920]   all got completely swamped with people trying to get the flight suit from Independence Day
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.920]   for '90.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.120]   Bill Pullman's actual flight suit from Independence Day, $39.95.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.760]   And so I'd like to talk to some of the people who got these deals.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.880]   Were they, you know, do they have little scripts that they were?
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880]   They tried.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.880]   Or they just got lucky.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.480]   They tried to make it so that you couldn't do that.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.720]   I think they just got lucky.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:05.240]   Of course there was the guy who posted on Reddit about 30 minutes later saying, "Okay,
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.520]   I bought 300 pounds of beans, of garbanzo beans, and my wife is going to get very mad
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.920]   at me when they pull up to the door.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920]   What do I do with them?"
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920]   It was only $89.99.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.640]   It was only $80 for the beans.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:23.800]   If anybody wants to buy memorabilia and old stuff like that, the amazing site that I don't
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.480]   hear a lot of people talking about, ICollector.com.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.480]   ICollector.com.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:31.880]   So I go there all the time and I do, I just do a search for the stuff posted in the last
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880]   24 hours.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.880]   It's an auction site.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.520]   So they have like revolvers from the old West.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:40.080]   They have dumbo ride elephants you can buy like, "Oh, wow."
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.120]   I mean, just every conceivable thing.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.680]   And every day there's like a theme.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.440]   How do they compete against eBay?
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.600]   I have no idea, but it's the most magnificent site for random stuff.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.280]   Maybe just by focusing on whoever's providing this stuff.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.520]   I will say cards go often.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.480]   So often cards against humanity does their thing as a joke.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.640]   And it's always a joke, right?
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.840]   This time they were very smart though.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.840]   They also sold one of their own products and it was always in stock.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:08.840]   And it was one of their card sets and the way they put it up there was it's regularly
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.840]   $2,000.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.840]   But today $20.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.800]   I thought that was really clever of them.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.800]   Very good.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.920]   I think they just got tired of being asked, "What's the deal?
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.920]   Why are you doing this?"
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.400]   And their answer was, "We just wanted to dig a big hole in the ground or whatever of the
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.800]   pranks that they've done over the years."
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.800]   I love the capture.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.040]   So they weren't normal captures.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040]   No.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.080]   And if I had grown up against this one, "Prove you're not a robot blank," that word should
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.640]   have a new meaning for all of us today.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   What's the answer?
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.440]   Obviously it's a quote from some movie.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.440]   Well, yeah, I'm not even sure.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.440]   Yeah, that must be.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.440]   Right?
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.120]   You had to prove you're a fan.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.680]   Yeah, one of them was like, "If you want all these beans, you need to type, "I'm a gigantic
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.640]   pig who wants to eat thousands of pounds of beans."
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.640]   That's amazing.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.920]   I'm so sad I missed this.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.920]   It was amazing.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.480]   It was pretty great.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480]   It's not over.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.680]   Deals you may have missed.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.080]   A Sony 4K TV, $34.99.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.080]   No.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.080]   And they've got all of them with these little animations.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.480]   Oh, a 17th century halber.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.120]   Where there's a guy in the weird orange jumpsuit thing.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.360]   Who is the genius who thought of this?
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.360]   That's brilliant.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360]   I wish it.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.360]   It's probably Max Temkin from Cards Against Mary.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360]   He's pretty cool.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.360]   Oh, the last item that went up for bid is the suit that the guy in the orange suit wears
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.360]   in all the other videos.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.200]   They sold that at the end.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.200]   Unwashed.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.200]   Unwashed.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.200]   Pancho Toilet.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.200]   No.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.200]   In my sense.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.040]   $800 Applebee's gift card.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.840]   Oh, just $8.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.520]   Think of all the Applebee's you'll be eating.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.680]   Yeah, there's the Picasso.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.000]   60 bucks for Picasso lithograph.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.440]   That is the dumbest looking Picasso I've ever seen.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.960]   Well, that's why it was available for $60.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.280]   Oh, I need a portable sauna.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.920]   A buck 70.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.360]   I love the poor.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.360]   Wow.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360]   That's my good guy.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.360]   A reverse flowbie.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.360]   A $100 bill from $1.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.360]   That was a good one.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.240]   This is just, this is so clever.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.840]   This is what the internet was made for.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:56.240]   See, you don't want to have this, some Chinese internet, some French.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.800]   You wouldn't see this on the French internet.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.000]   You get your vacation to Fiji.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   Luckily, we don't live in France.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   Oh, yeah, we get this.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.960]   Because they're in Chicago, so we get the American internet here.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.440]   Are they near Montgomery wards?
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:07.440]   They should take over that.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.440]   They're just a stone's throw.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.440]   Yeah, maybe they maybe weren't.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.240]   That'd be pretty funny.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.240]   [Sighs]
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.240]   That's a good gag though.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.240]   I like that.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.480]   I like that there's somebody out there saying, come on, Black Friday.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.120]   Let's take it down a notch.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.120]   That's good to see.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:28.640]   Meanwhile, Amazon workers in Europe and elsewhere protested Black Friday with, we are not robots.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.160]   We're just going to be replaced by robots if we keep this up.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.240]   Amazon's response was, yeah, we're working on it.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.240]   We're working on it.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.160]   No way, you just talk to us next year.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:44.360]   Union workers in the UK, Spain, Italy and Germany have all staged a wave of protests
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.080]   and strikes against what they call Amazon's dangerous high pressure work culture and its
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.080]   aggressive anti-union actions.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.080]   Good for them.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:58.400]   Yeah, this is a wacky story in Spain where apparently somebody involved in the Spanish
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.080]   warehouse that was being protested called the police and said, can you come and please
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.520]   tell them to stop protesting and get back to work?
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.880]   And the Spanish police were like, are you kidding?
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:12.120]   They're like, do you think that we're here to get your workers to go back to work again?
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120]   Uh, call finger to it.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.120]   This is Europe, man.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.600]   If you really care, call finger.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.600]   Strikes happen here.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:21.320]   Strike busters since 1923.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:25.720]   Our show today, actually before we do this, I want to play you a little video since we're
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.120]   all in a good mood.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.840]   Of what happened earlier this week on Twitch.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.000]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.200]   What can you do if you simply bolt jet engines and fuel tanks onto a human being?
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.200]   The new screensabers.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.520]   Dr. Gruberzich, thank you for joining us.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.960]   He's an aerospace engineer of gravity industries.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:51.600]   We're actually developing the world's first jet suit that can be bought, can be, we can
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.600]   do it demonstrations.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.320]   It is on sale in the UK at Selfridges for $400,000.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.320]   Oh, gee.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.320]   Selfridges.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.800]   Actually, I think they're having a Black Friday sale because it looks like it's only
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.360]   $373,000.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.120]   Windows weekly.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:14.400]   Troy Hunt, who does HaveIBePoned.com, wrote a piece about passwords two weeks ago in
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.720]   which he basically said, "Forget it, we're stuck with them."
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.640]   But I remember Bill Gates saying, "We wouldn't be."
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.280]   It's on its way, for sure.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.280]   They took a step in that direction this week.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:28.000]   Basically, once you configure your account with, I use the key in this case.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.760]   You can just use that to sign into devices.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:31.760]   iOS today.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.800]   This is what I've been playing this week.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.320]   It's called BitLife.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.920]   It is a text adventure game.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.440]   Right now, I'm 18 years old.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.440]   Oh, I've found that.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.240]   I'm going to end my life.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.240]   What?
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.480]   I'm done with this life.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.640]   You need to start over.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.360]   Kids, that's a permanent solution to a temporary problem.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.360]   Call a counselor.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.360]   To it.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.160]   It's what's for breakfast.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.400]   I can't stop playing that game, Bill Life.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400]   School dance.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.400]   It's time to go to your first school dance.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.160]   You're attracted to a boy named Kendrick Coleman.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.320]   What will you do?
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.960]   Ask Kendrick to go with me.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:05.960]   He rejected me.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.960]   Of course he did.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:07.960]   You know why?
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:12.800]   I'm ugly and stupid.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.160]   It's so much like real life.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:18.200]   You create a new person and you get whatever looks or smarts.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:24.280]   Sometimes, once I've been playing it a lot, once I got somebody really smart, really good-looking,
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:28.680]   great health, he was like everything and he got cancer and died like in his 50s.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.680]   It's tragic.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.680]   It's just like real life.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:32.360]   Sounds like a lot of fun.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.360]   Wow.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.360]   Great fun.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.520]   Are you saying he's going to get cancer and died?
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.960]   No, I'm just saying it's...
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:37.960]   He's good-looking.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:38.960]   He's smart.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.360]   Mike is good-looking and smart and he's going to live to 100.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.360]   I can tell.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.360]   I hate that about it.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.360]   I'm not going to play that game.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.360]   I'll tell you that.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.360]   No, don't play it.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360]   It's fun though.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.680]   Our show today brought to you by Slack.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:53.720]   This is actually almost a game that makes you more productive.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.360]   It's so much fun to use Slack.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.360]   I love Slack.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.560]   It's a collaboration hub for work.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.600]   Whatever work you do, we use Slack.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.720]   We moved over to a Slack from Hip Chat.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.520]   They acquired Hip Chat and we moved over and I am glad.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.520]   I've been...
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:11.480]   Truthfully, some of our staff has been lobbying for this for a long time.
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.640]   Megan and Jason, even though the corporate choice was Hip Chat, we're using Slack for
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.880]   their back channel for a long time because they prefer it.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.560]   They're very, very happy.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.160]   Slack keeps the right people on your team in the loop with the information they need
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.920]   always at their fingertips.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.920]   Better than email.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.440]   It's kind of like real-time collaboration that can happen on your schedule.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.440]   In fact, Slack even has a feature that says, "I am off."
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.440]   Do not...
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.480]   No, it will not bug you until you go back to work.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   I love that feature.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:49.200]   But you can always go back and look at previous conversations, verify that you did what they
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.960]   told you to do or that you told them to do what you wanted them to do.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:58.240]   You can organize conversation and more than just conversations, you get video, you get
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:03.280]   audio calling, video calling, integration with a thousand, more than a thousand apps
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.760]   like Jira and Salesforce and ZenDesk and Google Drive.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.000]   That was a key driver for us in choosing Slack.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.760]   We really had certain tools, about a dozen of them, we had to have integrated and only
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.760]   Slack let us do all of that.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:21.800]   Reduce email, streamline your team's communication, connect the tools and services you need in
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.920]   one fun, easy, good-looking interface.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.760]   I have to say, and you may think this is silly, but the fact that Slack looks so good has
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:34.760]   a lot to do with why it works so well because people want to use it.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.480]   They want to keep it running.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.320]   It's so no more searching through emails for that follow-up or searching through multiple
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.760]   systems to find the document you need.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.840]   No more multiple tabs and platforms to keep updated with work.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.120]   One place to put everything.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.480]   Of course, they have a mobile app for iOS, for Android, they sync seamlessly.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.680]   You can always pick up where you left off, no matter where you are.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.360]   Stuart Butterfield and his team have created an amazing tool.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.280]   Everybody uses it.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.640]   You want to use this.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.120]   With Slack, your team is better.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.800]   You can just go to slack.com and learn more.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.520]   Slack.com.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.400]   It is just so much fun.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.760]   Slack, where work happens?
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:21.120]   I'm a freelance journalist.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.120]   Nobody to talk to.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.120]   I come to be an art.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.120]   Can I?
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.120]   That'd be great.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.120]   I'll invite you.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.120]   You can be part of our Slack team.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.080]   You're the first person I've met who is not in too many Slacks.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.600]   I am in like 10.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.600]   I'm in the same mood.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.080]   It's as a freelancer.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.800]   It's how I keep in touch with.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.960]   That's my water cooler with other people.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.360]   The podcast network that I work with and the other podcast people I work with.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:47.760]   I have a bunch of them from small groups that are distributed.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:49.160]   It's amazing.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.640]   What do you use Slack for?
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.040]   This is no longer the ad, so you can say anything.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.640]   I don't use Slack because I can't get, you know, type.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.960]   Billionaires that I want to talk to are not.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.520]   What about you get a whole of billionaires?
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.520]   Phone them up?
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.520]   Well, it depends.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.600]   If they work for Facebook, you use Facebook Messenger.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:08.600]   Sure.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.600]   If they build a company.
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:14.720]   Would you like to buy only slightly used Facebook portal?
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.120]   Only used briefly.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:19.320]   I was going to say there was probably a billionaires, tech billionaires, Slack, and you're just
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.320]   not invited to.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.320]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.320]   They're all in there.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.080]   That's like via that dating site.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.080]   That's what I think.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.360]   Is there a dating site for rich people?
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.360]   But I bet you, well, I don't know.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   I'm not going to say anything.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.260]   I can say anything.
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:34.240]   I was going to almost got myself in trouble.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.080]   I'm not going to say anything.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:40.920]   Amazon, speaking of billionaires, almost a trillion now.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.400]   Actually briefly, Microsoft was worth more than Apple.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.160]   Yeah, I think that's important.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.560]   I think that's an important story.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:49.840]   It's not just a, you know, cool number story.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.040]   There's more to say about that.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.960]   Yeah, because I think, you know, it's still there.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.000]   The pendulum has swung.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.420]   There's an anti-silicon valley mood.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.420]   Facebook has lost 40% of its value since the peak.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:07.500]   There's similar numbers for Google, et cetera.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:16.340]   But Microsoft just had this strategy of just like cranking away at kind of like, you know,
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.460]   they're not building driverless cars.
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:22.140]   They're making tiny little enhancements to Bing.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:27.860]   So they're just doing essentially infrastructure, which is what Windows is, and keeping their
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:30.840]   heads down and they have for the last decade.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:36.400]   And this shows the, you know, now they're worth more than any company.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:40.640]   And investing in web services, which is we all focus on consumer tech so much.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:45.080]   It's like the Microsoft is really converting so much of their business into cloud stuff.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.080]   Right.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.080]   They just want to be a back-end.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.080]   That's right.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.040]   They just want to be what everything else runs on, whereas Facebook, which, you know, is
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:53.860]   like wants to be a brand.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.220]   Facebook is dying.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.220]   It does seem that way.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:01.460]   Facebook is a field is another kind of back end.
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.140]   It feels like things are going poorly for Facebook.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.140]   Oh my God.
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:09.740]   I remember last Thanksgiving when I was at a table with a bunch of tech people and half
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:13.460]   the people were saying Facebook's going down.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:15.060]   And the other half is saying, are you kidding?
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:16.220]   I'm just buying.
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:17.220]   It's at a discount.
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:21.020]   You know who says Facebook's going down is all of us, the people who tech community and
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:25.400]   who said the people who love Facebook still are all the people, mom and dad and sisters
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:29.040]   and bro, all the non techies who use it to stay in touch.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.960]   But the tech people are like, Oh, no one uses Facebook.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:33.960]   I'm on Instagram.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.120]   So I'm like, Oh, well, you have a salt.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.760]   I don't hit the table because it sounds loud.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.760]   Makes me angry.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.760]   Makes me jump.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.760]   But yeah, I am.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.600]   I am just shocked at how I hit the table.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.600]   That was good.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.600]   How they did it.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.600]   How mad is hell?
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.600]   Turn for Facebook.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.660]   I how low will Facebook go?
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:53.340]   So this is, by the way, they need your help, Jason.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:55.780]   This is from mspoweruser.com.
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:25:00.120]   They've made a graph in which it's almost impossible to tell who is who.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.020]   The light blue is Microsoft.
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.020]   Okay.
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:06.840]   Oh, oh, oh, like for the cross.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.580]   And then the dark blue is apple.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.380]   But here's the thing.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:19.220]   This really brief period in time when apple dropped and apples dropping precipitously.
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:23.300]   The problem with with stock market stuff is that you're comparing completely different
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.300]   companies, right?
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:28.920]   Like Amazon, we can compare the valuation of Amazon and Google and Microsoft and apple,
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.380]   but they're all in different businesses.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:34.460]   Like apple, you could make a strong argument has been undervalued for almost its entire
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:38.520]   existence because the market kind of doesn't understand what they do.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.380]   But they're also in this period where they're hiding their phone sales and only showing
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:45.740]   their revenue and there's some skepticism there.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:50.500]   Microsoft has made this amazing cultural shift under Sacha Nadella where they are investing
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:56.500]   in the cloud and becoming a much more kind of company that I think Wall Street can bank
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.500]   on.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.060]   Like they always understood Microsoft and they kind of get where they're going and Wall
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.580]   Street once did not be surprised or confused.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:06.460]   They like to reward understanding what your business is and Microsoft's understandable.
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:09.980]   Yeah, you could actually see the Sacha Nadella hockey stick in that chart.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:10.980]   Totally.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:15.060]   Whereas like about a year after he took charge and his policy started kicking in and Balmer
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.780]   was a fading memory, they started taking off.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:19.060]   Yeah, but guy's super smart.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:20.060]   Also it's interesting.
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.760]   I think maybe one of the last times I was on, we talked about this axis of privacy versus
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:28.860]   selling people's personal information and the unlikely bedfellows you get.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:32.460]   Apple and Microsoft are kind of on the same side of that spectrum, right?
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:36.700]   Where they're not building businesses based on people's information.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:41.460]   And that when we talk about regulating the tech industry and making trouble for Facebook
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:42.460]   and Google.
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:48.020]   I think if I were an observer of this industry, I would look at Microsoft and if you were.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.900]   Well, I'm not from a financial perspective.
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:51.420]   I don't care what the stock prices are.
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.740]   It's not my bag.
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:57.980]   But I would be noting, I guess, if I were an investor that Microsoft and Apple might
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:03.060]   be able to skate away from some of this in a way that Facebook and Google can't.
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:05.100]   Maybe Amazon can skate away.
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.100]   I don't know what's happening.
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:07.740]   Amazon can probably skate away.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.140]   And Amazon's got the cloud dust.
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.380]   That's, I mean, talking about consumers.
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:13.900]   They're skating away.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.660]   And we focus on Microsoft's consumer business.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:20.980]   Everybody focuses on Amazon being the people that bring you boxes.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:23.820]   But AWS runs like the whole internet at this point.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:25.260]   They're so valuable.
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.740]   And the strategy seems to be like, let's just not remind everybody who we are and what
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:30.740]   we do.
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:36.660]   Let's just build the stuff that the government and everybody else runs on and just become
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.660]   a utility.
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:44.860]   Yeah, you know, and to be fair, Google kind of has that strategy.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.740]   YouTube is the outlier.
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:50.580]   But I remember going to Google, God, eight years ago.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:53.020]   And I'd just done a story about Google.
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.660]   No, it was five years ago.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:57.180]   And it was a big cover story.
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:02.020]   And they fired the PR guy who had kind of helped me with it.
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:04.700]   I said, look, I need to close the story.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:05.700]   Why don't you help me?
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.220]   You know, I just need a couple business figures.
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.420]   There was a story on Google Maps.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:15.700]   And the PR manager said to me, we don't want to give you any figures at all.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:16.940]   And I was like, why?
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.460]   It's just a simple question.
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:22.980]   They're like, we don't like to remind people that we're a company.
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:23.980]   Wow.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:24.980]   This is an option.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:25.900]   Oh, my God.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.420]   What are they?
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.420]   An amorphous cloud.
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:31.580]   They just want to be a cloud.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.940]   We just want to be a cloud.
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:34.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:35.940]   I don't like the air.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.420]   We're all around you, but you can't see.
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:40.860]   And I just was like, God, I'd love to be a PR manager for Google.
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:46.300]   It just has sit there and be like, oh, you want to figure out how big my company is?
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.300]   No, no.
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:48.300]   We're not a company.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:49.300]   We're an Italian restaurant.
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.860]   We're spending against the wall to see what sticks.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:53.780]   That's actually very accurate.
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:55.260]   Cloud.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:29:02.340]   So this is an interesting time because we all were talking two or three months ago about
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.540]   who would be the first trillion dollar company, the Apple won that race.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:08.700]   But it was going to be Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:13.140]   And now after the tech slump, nobody's a trillion dollar company.
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.780]   And it seems like that was, was that a bubble?
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:19.180]   Was that a brief moment in time when tech was still king?
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.340]   And is it all over?
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:21.340]   They're all moving up.
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:22.340]   I mean, you saw that.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.340]   You're hockey stick.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:24.340]   Yeah.
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:25.340]   Just temporary blip.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.100]   Yeah, I mean, they're generally moving up.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.100]   They're going up and down.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:29.860]   Here's a one year Amazon graph.
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:30.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.340]   It was going up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:37.420]   But you'll end up ahead of that the beginning of the year, which I agree with Mike.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.700]   That's the trend here.
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.460]   It's look, stocks are made out of the mood.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:44.380]   It's the collective mood of the market.
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.380]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:46.380]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.500]   Tech regulation gets talked about like on this show, everybody gets a little scared.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:53.620]   They get out of it a little bit because it's an emotional reaction.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:57.660]   You don't think the stock market reacts emotionally because they should all be like characters in
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:00.820]   a Michael Lewis book, but that is not the case.
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:04.780]   And this is a case also where a lot of investors don't understand all the dynamics of the
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:05.780]   tech market.
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:10.060]   I think they're smart tech analysts and smart tech investors, but they're also a lot of
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:14.100]   people who they just get spooked when somebody says, "We're going to regularly Facebook and
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:16.900]   kick YouTube out of Europe," and they sell some stock.
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:17.900]   Yeah.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.460]   And both Microsoft and Apple are kind of in the same business.
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:24.580]   They're both in the business of selling expensive things to people who have money.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:27.700]   And unlike Google, which is in the business of just, I guess, getting everybody to use
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:34.180]   the internet and somehow getting ad dollars pennies from trillions of advertisers.
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:41.340]   But both Microsoft and Apple are looking for, in Microsoft's case, it's corporations.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:44.180]   And corporations always spend a lot of money.
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:45.540]   There's a lot of profitability in that.
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.540]   Apple is also big in corporate America.
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:52.340]   They spend a lot of stuff, but they're mostly in the business of squeezing every nickel
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:55.020]   out of the people who are the biggest spenders.
[01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:58.700]   And so that's a business that's just going to keep going up and up and up.
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:03.420]   And I think we mentioned that Microsoft isn't messing around with a self-driving car.
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:05.860]   I actually think Apple is.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.660]   I think Apple is working on a self-driving car.
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:09.140]   I think just to abandon their car project.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.660]   They're still working on it.
[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:15.340]   I think they abandoned the idea they were going to immediately build an entire car.
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:19.180]   I'm not so convinced that they've completely abandoned that either.
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:22.860]   They're working with, what is that Austrian company that does essentially?
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:27.860]   They're the flax con of, yeah, dryer or something like that.
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.380]   I don't remember exactly what it was.
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:31.220]   But I'm convinced.
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:36.660]   I mean, my basic logic about Apple is that iPhones are not going to take them to the
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:39.580]   next, they're not going to be able to continue growth with phones.
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:42.580]   They're not going to do it with Macs or iPads.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.900]   They're certainly not going to do it with tablets.
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:49.660]   They're probably not going to do it with services unless they really go cross-platform on financial
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.060]   services.
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:55.300]   And I don't know where they're going to go unless they're going to have a huge, it's
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:58.260]   not going to be augmented reality glasses, although that may help.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:01.700]   I really think self-driving cars are the next big entertainment platform.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:05.980]   When you're in a self-driving car, you're sitting there, not driving.
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:09.980]   And so it's an opportunity for virtual reality, music, all this stuff that Apple's going to
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:10.980]   do.
[01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:11.980]   And they're not going to let anybody else own that.
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:12.980]   No one else.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:13.980]   No one else.
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.540]   No one else agrees with you, the founder of Atari.
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:16.540]   Are you?
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:21.900]   Do you think all these companies have somebody like Xing Yi?
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:24.660]   No, there's only one Xing Yi.
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.660]   This was the guy.
[01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:28.620]   I wonder what Xing Yi is doing now that Verizon owns AOL.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.340]   I doubt Xing Yi still employed David Xing Yi.
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:32.980]   I'm sure he's a digital profit somewhere.
[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:33.980]   Oh, no, he is.
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:35.180]   He's Oath's digital profit now.
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:36.180]   Oh, good.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:43.380]   So this is Xing Yi who is by day, he says, "I am Oath's digital profit working across
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:46.060]   the globe to identify new opportunities for the business."
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:49.900]   Do you feel though that all these companies, Apple and everybody, need somebody like this
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:55.140]   who is just kind of thinking out of the box about what the future is going to look like?
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:58.820]   For instance, Amazon, you could almost follow the trail.
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:01.180]   Well, we sell stuff while advertising.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:05.500]   Well, wouldn't it be great if we had a captive environment where people could see our ads
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.020]   and shop all the time?
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.660]   What about a self-driving car?
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:12.380]   They'd be in a living room and we'd be just surrounding them with ads all the time.
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:16.300]   And every time they get in the car, we'd sell $1,000 with the goods.
[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.780]   And then it says, "Oh, we should be doing self-driving cars."
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:21.940]   Do you think companies, it feels like companies are doing that.
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.620]   They're so desperate to know what's next.
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:27.580]   I feel like there are MBAs that are doing the, "How do we crank up the revenue?"
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.500]   Dial, only that's happening at Apple.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.620]   That's gray and prosaic.
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:35.380]   But I think there are also, look, Google X or whatever they call it now, but it's the
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.940]   alphabet, the big bets.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:41.420]   Apple has a huge R&D budget that keeps ramping up probably because of the car stuff.
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:46.020]   I think these are all symptoms of companies that know full well that you're big today,
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:49.660]   they're going to die in 20 years, and they don't want to die.
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:50.660]   They want to be immortal.
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:55.900]   The only way to do that is to use their enormous resources today to fund all of that research
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:59.180]   so that they can find the next big thing and transform their company.
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.180]   They're all bets, right?
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:01.180]   Whether they hit on it.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:04.700]   But I do think Google especially, like Larry and Sergey, have always been obsessed with
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:07.540]   that idea of transforming their business down the road.
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:10.500]   And you see it, I think Apple does it and doesn't tell anybody because that's Apple's
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.500]   playbook, but they also want to continue to transform.
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:16.500]   I think a lot of the spending is that nobody wants to be caught flat-footed.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.580]   So let's say it all goes toward augmented reality.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:22.260]   A company like Apple doesn't want to be like, "Well, we don't know anything about it.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:23.340]   We have no engineers.
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:25.180]   We don't have any technology."
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:26.660]   So they're working on that.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.820]   I mean, augmented reality is coming for sure.
[01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:32.260]   I mean, I don't think anybody is questioning that, but there are other things like self-driving
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:33.260]   cars.
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:35.300]   Yes, they're definitely coming, but will they be profitable?
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:36.300]   Will people buy them or rent them?
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.300]   We'll be like Uber?
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.300]   Who knows?
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:41.300]   Yeah, and you don't want to be like Apple, I think, realize they don't want to be a metal
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:44.780]   bender, that if they're going to be in that business, the bad end of that business is
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.700]   the company that's making the automobile.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:47.940]   But they want the technology.
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:50.380]   They want the staff that can do light arms.
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:52.380]   And the skills that come along with it, right?
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:56.740]   I mean, the place where Apple got caught flat-footed really, I think more than anything else is machine
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:00.140]   learning stuff, where Google really got way ahead of them there.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:03.700]   And I think Apple has invested a lot of money and we don't see all of those evidence.
[01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:07.380]   Just in the last year or two, we see some evidence about them starting to accelerate
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:10.300]   there, but they got caught and they hate that, right?
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:11.820]   Because they've got a lot of money.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.620]   They've got a huge amount of cash.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:17.020]   And one big thing you've got to do is try to hedge against these places where you could
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:18.340]   get killed.
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:21.940]   Because if you're too far behind and then next transition point, you will die.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:25.060]   The best bad example was how Microsoft missed the Internet.
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:29.140]   I mean, Microsoft just ruled the world in the '90s.
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:33.700]   And by the mid to early '90s, they were kind of like, "Yeah, we don't need the Internet.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.180]   We have windows in the office.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:36.820]   We own it all."
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:39.980]   And then the Internet happened, they're like, "Whoops, we should have really learned about
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:41.460]   this and then ahead of this."
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:45.100]   Do you think you could get a roadmap of what a company's thinking about by looking at who
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.900]   they acquire?
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:47.900]   That gives you some idea.
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:48.900]   I'm looking at Apple.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:52.100]   They acquired, I mean, it's pretty diverse.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:56.660]   This is from Wikipedia, "A chip development company, a music management platform, a music
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:01.740]   and image recognition, lenses for augmented reality, glasses, digital magazine, subscription
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:07.420]   service, that's one of our sponsors, TechScher, feedback platform for development teams,
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.860]   data science, green screen technology, tools for...
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:14.700]   I mean, that's just this year.
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:16.700]   It's really a diverse group of companies.
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:19.140]   And sometimes, I mean, it's always like supermarket sweep.
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.180]   Sometimes I think they want to hire people because they're specific tech.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:22.420]   They're like, "We should own that."
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:26.180]   And sometimes it's, "We need to learn about this and these are the only people in the world
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.180]   who know about it so we want them to hire."
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:32.100]   In every case, it's something Apple's got enough interest in to lay out some cash.
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:34.900]   In some aspects of what they see as their future.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:37.700]   Or they just want a technical team that can work together.
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:39.260]   And they say, "Get your idea.
[01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.100]   We just need another hundred years."
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:42.100]   We don't like that.
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:43.780]   And you guys seem to be able to stand each other.
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:48.060]   They had a bunch of sensor tech people that they hired that is basically the front-facing
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:50.580]   camera on the iPhone X is very clearly where that went.
[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:52.100]   Is they with the infrared beams?
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.100]   That was the Israeli company.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.100]   The really connected.
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:59.220]   And then there are some, like, they saw the shortcuts app in the, or what was it called,
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:00.220]   Workflow in the App Store.
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:02.140]   And they're like, "I want that in Siri."
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:03.740]   And they just bought them and integrated them.
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:05.540]   And it can be, or some of these cars.
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:08.060]   And by the way, that took how many years, two or three years?
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:09.060]   It took a couple years.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.780]   So you could say, "Oh, they acquired that.
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:12.980]   They must have plans, but that doesn't mean you're going to see anything.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:16.540]   We're a lot of companies that you have to do a lot of detective work.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.860]   And some people in the press are very good at doing the detective work, but there are
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:23.100]   totally companies that have fallen through the cracks that have been bought by Apple.
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:24.100]   You don't know.
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:25.100]   No idea.
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:29.380]   What's amazing, we're talking about tech companies getting in the car business, but
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:34.260]   there was recently some news that the car companies were getting into the tech business.
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:35.260]   Okay.
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.260]   So, like, you know.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.260]   Good luck with that.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:38.260]   Ford.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:39.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:44.940]   So, Ben Volko, CEO of Antomo, which is some OEM companies, told me that by 2020, bundling
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:49.740]   and selling data from connected cars will be a massive new revenue.
[01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:51.940]   We know that OnStar does that today.
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:54.260]   That's a big revenue for GM.
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:56.180]   So they're getting into the Google business.
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:57.180]   They know where you go.
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.180]   Yeah.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.180]   That is terrifying.
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.180]   So, like, yeah.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.180]   It's going to save their ass by getting into it.
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:03.180]   But who's not going to do that?
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:05.940]   If somebody has that data, who's not going to get in that business?
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.940]   Well, the answer is Apple and Microsoft.
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:08.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:13.380]   The Starbucks is going to spy on me when I'm drinking a little latte and say, "Oh, yeah,
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.380]   Adam, he looks a little depressed."
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.380]   Here's my question.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.260]   Actually, this is a question I've been asking because I got, as I mentioned, this Facebook
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.900]   portal, which is their video calling thing.
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:23.020]   Actually, could you bring it in here and show people?
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:24.780]   So it's actually great.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:25.780]   It really works.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:27.140]   It's got a very good camera on it.
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:29.980]   The problem is that it's saddled by the fact that it's a Facebook portal.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.900]   Yeah, people are going to be nervous that it's Facebook.
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:32.900]   Maybe.
[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:37.380]   But that, again, is maybe just us and that everybody in the flyover states is going to
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:38.380]   say, "Great."
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:39.580]   Just when I always wanted to wait a quick.
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:43.780]   My wife has not tuned to detect it all and she saw the TV ad and she said, "Oh, hell no."
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:45.620]   I thought those were kind of intro.
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.620]   Anyway.
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:50.340]   So, one thing that scared people was this idea that camera follows you around, which
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:52.580]   is dopey because the camera isn't following you around.
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:53.860]   It's not a motion camera.
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:57.540]   It's just they zoom into a portion of the real thing.
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:58.540]   It's a similar consciousness.
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.340]   It pays attention to different areas.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:01.340]   It's got like a fish and island.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:06.740]   The real thing to be scared of, it's got a wide angle 4K lens that can see the entire
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:07.740]   room.
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:10.060]   So, yeah, you're only seeing what it's zoomed in on.
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:15.980]   But Marx, and by the way, I've used and they've provided privacy built in a 30 cent plastic
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:17.700]   look to cover the camera.
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:18.700]   Wow.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:19.700]   That's a two cent plastic.
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:20.700]   Talk about an afterthought.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:23.380]   You know, maybe people would worry about this camera.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.940]   Why don't we include this in the package?
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:29.340]   It's just a little plastic thing that goes over the camera.
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:30.940]   But this is a very high res camera.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:31.940]   So here's my question.
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:36.540]   And it's the same thing people have talked about with Amazon Zeko and Google's Home.
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:40.580]   Are they're not Mark Wooden?
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:44.220]   There's no way Facebook would use the video on this camera.
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:49.100]   Here's obviously no human is going to look at it, but would they maybe put some AI looking
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:53.500]   at it looking for say books I read or clothes I wear or food I eat?
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.300]   Who's in your house?
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:40:00.580]   What the clothes are that they're wearing because Facebook's person recognition actually
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:05.700]   can recognize you from the back because it knows your clothes and stuff like that.
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:07.980]   There's all kinds of data that they can you do.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:08.980]   Who's paying attention to it?
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:10.060]   So you think they would use that?
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.300]   Absolutely.
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:15.220]   Have you seen this picture?
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:17.700]   Let me tell me where it is so I can show it.
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:19.500]   It's Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.500]   What's he doing?
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.140]   He puts tape over his laptop.
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:23.140]   Oh yeah.
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:30.220]   So Mark who doesn't in fact let his laptop camera see what he's up to is putting 4k cameras
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:34.580]   or trying to get me to pay $300 to put a 4k camera in my house.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.340]   Let's not forget a piece of plastic tape.
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:37.580]   Well I have the privacy card.
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:41.860]   Facebook has a bad reputation that we're talking about in terms of mining all of this
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:45.380]   data in order to get information about all of us.
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:47.980]   Mark, let's not, hey Facebook, let's talk.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:49.420]   Mark wants to talk to you.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:54.740]   We have to also say they have a terrible track record at security and they've had lots
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:56.300]   of data breaches.
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:03.100]   So that is another part of this is okay great do I trust Facebook as an information provider
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.460]   maybe maybe not?
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:09.140]   Do I trust them technically to not get hacked?
[01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:10.140]   Maybe maybe not.
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:14.020]   Well here's a job for Adam.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:18.860]   To figure out what they are doing, look at what the user agreement doesn't say they're
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:21.500]   not doing and that's what they're doing guaranteed.
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.180]   I mean this is a knock at this.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.740]   Oh but would that be illegal?
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:30.420]   No no what I'm saying is if the user agreement you have a privacy user agreement doesn't and
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:34.380]   all that stuff all the mumbo jumbo that comes along with that product if they if they don't
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:37.660]   say we're not watching you they're watching you if they don't say they're not monetizing
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.540]   I see what they don't say they're doing.
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:40.540]   Yes.
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:41.540]   Assume the negative.
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:45.300]   And if they update their privacy policy to remove something they're doing that.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:46.300]   Yes.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:49.500]   So good luck with that and look forward to your next book.
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.180]   So Valley of Evil.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:55.900]   So it's not just Mark I mean everybody in tech paint tapes over their camera that's kind
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:56.900]   of the default thing.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:57.900]   You've got to do that.
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:01.940]   And yet I think people are putting Amazon Echo shows there's the picture of his this
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:06.820]   was a publicity still he did with a fate with an Instagram frame around his head but if people
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:11.660]   look closely at his laptop which is a Mac there's tape over the camera.
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:14.580]   I think that's just amazing.
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:18.540]   But I but you know I think that's pretty common in Silicon Valley it is that that's another
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:23.100]   thing maybe is there is this thought well we'll protect our problem Mark who says who
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:27.380]   nobody needs to be private bought all four houses surrounding his home for millions of
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:30.040]   dollars so that he could be private right.
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:35.060]   So clearly he wants privacy but is that the Silicon Valley point of view is that well
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:37.700]   you know we want it but but other people don't care.
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:40.700]   Well I'm sorry go ahead now.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:47.060]   I mean I think well we're clearly in a big backlash against Silicon Valley and I think
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:53.500]   that is the perception to get back to this perception is reality that Silicon Valley
[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:58.860]   says oh no privacy is okay for you or you know don't look behind the curtain it's all
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:02.960]   going to be fine but in their personal lives you know whether it's putting they clearly
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:03.960]   care.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:09.760]   It's putting tape over their camera lens because they know what's going on or sending their
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.140]   kids to Waldo schools that's that is the story you know.
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:15.860]   They got the solos in North Dakota.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:19.420]   Different rules the tech elite has different rules and different standards that they apply
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:26.060]   to themselves then they applied to the rest of the world and that's what is is fueling
[01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:33.200]   this massive rage that I think we're just you know that's out there that elected Trump
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:37.940]   to call back then it sounds like Facebook's in trouble.
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:42.940]   I for a long time I was kind of on the oh let's just buy low like this is just a blip
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:50.740]   but now it just seems to the news just gets worse and worse and the excuses look dumber
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.540]   and dumber.
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:59.740]   But where else do you go I mean as a big Google+ fan now that's dead in the water with dead
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:05.000]   social network walking and you know I'm casting about for the thing that I thought Google+
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.680]   was going to be back in back in 2012 I thought Google+ would be the one network where you
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:11.120]   have lots of smart people.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:15.240]   So where do you go for that there is literally no place where you can go where everybody's
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:19.800]   there and you can of course Google+ was never the place where everybody was there but Facebook
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:22.480]   still has what I call a monopoly on everyone.
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:26.160]   They have your cousin your old school mate your former colleagues.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:32.240]   Facebook is the phone book and that's why people go to fit nobody has ever liked Facebook
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.240]   company.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.500]   I got to say though I was surprised because I in order to use this portal I had to reactivate
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:41.100]   my Facebook account I had to reactivate it to set up the portal of course and I will
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:42.100]   deactivate it.
[01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:45.780]   But when I would look to Facebook I thought this has gotten so much worse I'm looking
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:50.180]   at my front page it's a sideways picture of a memory from a year ago that I couldn't care
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:51.180]   less about.
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:54.660]   You don't have don't show the rest because I don't want to embarrass anybody then it's
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:59.120]   a paste at first I think this is a friend of mine the last few years have taught me when
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:03.040]   it's time to leave this body no one can stop it I'm starting oh this is a friend of mine
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:08.160]   and then I read after that copy this message in your wall and she's copied it in fact her
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:11.480]   post immediately after I'm not sure if I did this copy your wall thing right there are
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:16.560]   all these cyber verbs that baffle me so some somebody has posted something somebody else
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:23.480]   wrote okay nice then there's an ad for VMware Fusion useful then there's a big announcement
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:28.600]   about the affordable care act enrollment period that I couldn't care less then there's a picture
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:34.440]   from Axios about of with a kid starving in Yemen then there's finally somebody I know
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:39.680]   and care about Andy Inako who's posted his picture of close a picture of his left over
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:46.400]   turkey left over turkey this is not garbage attractive content but maybe social media
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:51.660]   just is a natural thing that goes in waves like kind of gaming where there's always a
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:56.780]   new one because the kids are into a new thing unlike what we're assuming like oh there just
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:01.400]   has to be one I'm gonna predict something okay I think we're gonna get a social not merely
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:06.300]   an Silicon Valley backlash social media backlash I think people are starting to realize that
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:10.500]   social media is not making them happy it's not making them well it's not good for us and
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:14.980]   people are good kids especially gonna drop out it's already happening I think and but
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:20.100]   you're right about generational stratifications like Instagram is younger than Facebook Snapchat
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:24.480]   is younger than Instagram there is presumably something underneath Snapchat that will happen
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:31.180]   that I'm not aware of yet because my youngest is 13 so but it's gonna happen and Facebook
[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:36.940]   is gonna be replaced not by another Facebook but by whatever replaces it I will say sometimes
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:42.660]   be by the way the what was the name of the Instagram video feed that was a flop remember
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:49.380]   that IGTV IGTV ain't gonna be that yeah so so I do wonder the big question whenever any
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:52.500]   of us sitting at this table try to predict the future is are we are we predicting the
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:56.220]   future because as tech people we see what's coming or are we in the tech bubble and we've
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:59.780]   missed what's coming and that it's very hard to tell the difference but my gut feeling
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:05.220]   is to call it back to our previous sponsor on this episode that private networking like
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:09.900]   Slack where you can choose people you know and throw them in a room and let them talk
[01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:14.540]   to each other and you get off of sort of like the broader public of Twitter and Facebook
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:19.420]   is more appealing to the people I know and so many people I know don't share on Twitter
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:22.940]   anymore and they all just go into Slack what about real conversations with people who are
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:28.100]   sitting across from you oh come on Leo ridiculous well that's great if those people are nearby
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:32.140]   is it is if we found it's so valuable to be able to talk to people geographically distributed
[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:36.700]   that we're gonna put up with the kind of shallow experience and the negatives that go along
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:40.300]   with that misunderstandings and things like that that go along with that or we why not
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:45.460]   just aren't there enough people around you in physical space to keep you entertained
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:48.540]   or maybe not I think that's the secret to the Internet is that you find that there are
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:53.460]   lots of other people like you that are just not interested in the thing that social media
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:58.660]   gives us is that we can make a connection with somebody and retain a connection it's not
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:02.940]   a great connection but it's a connection I travel all over the world we live in one country
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:07.060]   in another country another country another country and social media is the only way that
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:10.540]   we stay in touch I get to see what they're having for dinner what they're doing with
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:14.620]   the traveling the ball but above and I feel good about that but you did say something
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:18.820]   important it's not a great connection it's not a great connection it's a lot of nothing
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:23.820]   with a lot of errors in that connection misunderstandings misinterpretations I look at face gram
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:31.220]   my face gram face gram I see the kids on the face gram and they're really promoting a
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:35.580]   life they're not actually leading their oh yeah it's yes I see a lot of that and I know
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:40.220]   doesn't make me feel good I don't know if I see I know you don't do that Mike but that's
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:47.580]   only because I know you for real yeah and so I think there's so much error introduced
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:53.260]   in that feed yeah that it's actually maybe not healthy I know I on my side you know I
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:59.300]   I remember quitting my job across the country and the only way I knew what all my friends
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:03.820]   were doing is because of the social networks I locked myself in a room for literally four
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:09.620]   years and the only way I connected had any connection with my friends or could do that
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:15.540]   to write this book was because of these the social media and I agree all the flaws are
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:22.180]   there did you see the influencers story in the micro influence yeah was it New York times
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:29.740]   I think it was I my friend I hope I'm not giving away a confidence here my friend a
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:33.340]   penthouse made for instance no that's a good story too but there's one more reason I'll
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:39.780]   find it this week but my friend Trey Radcliffe the photographer who made his bones on Google
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:49.380]   Plus and Facebook has turned and he's writing a book now about how social media is harmful
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:55.860]   yeah oh yeah and I think that that's not unusual I think there are a lot of people like us
[01:49:55.860 --> 01:50:01.660]   like me and Trey it's a Roger Roger Mac to me that one of you know he hated Google from
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:07.580]   day one he wasn't an early investor in Facebook I mean rather I mean I don't know how hard
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:15.060]   I mean a lot of money on it and he just came out with a book zucked you know the education
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:21.260]   of an unlikely activist yeah I mean when Silicon Valley itself and of course you know itself
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:26.540]   is turning but here's what I think is happening in social media I think there is a general
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:32.540]   slow decline in Facebook among certain types of people and that will damage it the biggest
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:38.020]   damage will come from companies corporations who are who get sickened by the games that
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:43.380]   Facebook plays with the you know when they post something one percent get it or something
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:47.300]   like that they pay a lot of money it's a few more percent that that's BS and so corporations
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:51.780]   they're in trouble there with Twitter I think that will always be a bastion for journalists
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:55.900]   and a lot of celebrities and everybody else is kind of souring on it but Instagram is
[01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:00.020]   interesting I think I feel like Instagram is kind of a send in right now but what's happening
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:04.540]   interestingly with Instagram is that people are getting fed up with the BS on Instagram
[01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:10.420]   so I see a shift actually on Instagram where people are posting kind of realer stuff and
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:15.120]   kind of unfollowing the phony baloney look at my beautiful life stuff a little bit and
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:20.180]   so I really think Instagram has a great future except for the fact that if Facebook declines
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:24.540]   too much Facebook as a corporation is going to have to change Instagram because they own
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:28.620]   it to be more like Facebook right that's the danger because I agree with you why do they
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:32.140]   have to do that well I mean at some point if Facebook declines they got to make their
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:36.100]   money somewhere why don't they just change their name to Instagram and they're gonna have
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:40.580]   to wreck the face gram presumably it is not as as monetized as it would need to be a replace
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:46.540]   of a suit well I mean it maybe I don't I agree I all my friends are on Instagram Instagram
[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:52.540]   Instagram's the one that I dropped it's - there's like a some pleasure but it seems like it's
[01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:58.860]   turning junky - you know it's like a sort of car it's turning into a car smart note this
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:05.460]   is wired magazine inside the pricey word influencer Instagram feed she talks about a woman named
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:12.740]   Sahara Lottie who started a lash extension copy company Lasha Phi in 2017 her investors
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:19.220]   said if you want to succeed quality doesn't matter customer satisfaction doesn't matter
[01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:25.340]   only influencers she was told to expect to shell out 50 to 70 thousand dollars per influencer
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:30.340]   just to make her company's name known now this is in a particular category lash extensions
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:34.420]   but make up that kind of thing there was no way around it that's just how things worked
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:39.660]   at the time Lottie found the suggestion observed bordering on offensive she thought paying some
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:44.100]   random person on the internet tens of thousands dollars just because they had a lot of followers
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:49.980]   was beneath her so she brushed off the suggestion looking back now a year later Lottie realizes
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:55.540]   how horribly naive she was she may have avoided folk working over cash sure but she
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:01.580]   end up paying for her decision nevertheless these people social media influencers charging
[01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:06.940]   60 thousand dollars for one video review which by the way doesn't violates FTC rules by not
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:14.220]   saying it's an ad right 85 thousand dollars to publicly disparage a competitor's product
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:18.660]   in so influencers with a sizable following rarely have to purchase products in their niche
[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:23.420]   makeup clothing plants books you name it all come free often delivered to the influencers
[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:28.740]   home or office in a highly instagrammable box it's funny that wired is writing about this
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:34.340]   because I worked at wired and we got everything free you know I actually got off that train
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:39.780]   by insulting everybody I knew nobody sends nobody sends you anything but actually are
[01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:43.700]   you sure I sent this article to Lisa said you know we've got to reposition our advertising
[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:50.780]   as influence yes we're influencers we could charge four times more Sanders Kennedy a popular
[01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:56.300]   YouTuber with over 200,000 subscribers was once offered a couple of thousand dollars to
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:54:01.460]   leave a particular beverage on his desk while filming filming he doesn't recall the brand
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:04.420]   but says a representative told him he only needed to make sure the drink appeared within
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:09.780]   the frame to get his paycheck and therein is the key to understanding Instagram and both
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:16.060]   its success and its nauseating qualities is that not exactly what happens on television
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:20.420]   if you if you tune into a morning show there's a big cup that has like you know it's a branded
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:24.620]   thing and they paid a fortune for it's exactly the same product but the reason Instagram
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:32.340]   is escaping a lot of the problems of Twitter and Facebook is that it's unbelievably frivolous
[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:36.780]   there's no place on Instagram to influence an election for example there's no place for
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:42.940]   you know races trolls or whatever the comments are all vacuuses can be that the posts are just
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:48.620]   irrelevant it's the new television yeah and I think it's I think that's why it's a
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:55.940]   descendant I think you're right and I think you know we talk about influencers the tech
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:01.140]   companies in Silicon Valley are the new kind of you know they're not they're not they're
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:06.740]   finding ways to better extract rents now okay they're no it's no longer we thought think
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:12.540]   about them as innovative but really they're just ret you know YouTube in 2016 bought a
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:19.980]   company called fame bit are you familiar with fame bit no fame bit is an influencers auction
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:26.220]   site Wow YouTube owns this through fame bit YouTube has partnered with over 9,000 brands
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:31.820]   and countless influencers generating revenue from each deal Google YouTube is actually
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:37.740]   encouraging this here's one feminine hygiene tips video looking for the perfect influencer
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:43.580]   up to ten thousand dollars at Nutriblast so that's the name of the product campaign goals
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:49.900]   target if you if you want if you're a youtuber and you think you're right for this you you
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:56.260]   make a bid I applied for that they didn't they didn't want that no uh-huh this is YouTube
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:02.740]   owns this and promotes it incredible I figure Instagram probably does something similar
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:08.580]   fame but fame bit posts reviewed by wired touted potential earnings of up to what 20,000
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:17.460]   dollars for what appeared to be a single review or video I tell you the influencer thing
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:24.140]   does not bother me on its face if they disclose if they disclose it and the audience understands
[01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:27.300]   but it makes me not want to use Facebook or Instagram because it's just loaded with that
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:31.300]   crap well the problem you don't have to follow these people right problem with it is it's
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:35.540]   almost impossible nowadays to get a following like that the way to get a fall a huge following
[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:41.220]   place like Instagram or YouTube is start like five five ten years ago and uh and and do
[01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:46.460]   everything right and take up or be famous somewhere else and if I took off my clothes
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:51.900]   I don't think that would well yeah not you yeah either none of us we're trying to have
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:56.660]   a big Instagram following a big tent out there you never know but anyway it's it's you know
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:57:01.060]   it's it's it's it's very very difficult for somebody starting out today to get a huge
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:05.020]   following on Instagram even if they take their clothes off well who maybe maybe if they take
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:08.540]   the clothes off you should try Jason I don't know there's machine learning to block this
[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:14.020]   picture see okay but but yeah the influencer economy I mean there was another article out
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:18.020]   there about micro influencers there the new target is not people with huge following but
[01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:24.180]   medium sized followings they're cheaper they're micro they're cheaper grow influencer but
[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:29.260]   you you get you get you know a thousand people who each have 10,000 followers or something
[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:34.500]   like that instead of the one person who has a million and that that's like Google um text
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:40.700]   ads yes AdSense for social media ads right where it's what I don't need to buy at a big
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:46.040]   brand anymore I can just buy a huge raft of people who fit a kind of profile and their
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:50.780]   followers will see it yep so anybody wants to influence their following will get a free
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:57.460]   copy of Valley of Genius just right oh read the wired article because it's very sad what
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:58:04.660]   happens to Lasha fight she gets attacked by somebody who's paid to attack her on YouTube
[01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:11.420]   and it hurts her badly and then there's a feud it's it's actually a traumatic story
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:18.500]   that should be a mini series fortunately Lasha fights survived the whole thing and by the
[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:23.820]   way the author's sister has been paid for promotional posts on Instagram that's the entry
[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:28.820]   into the story that's the source yeah she talked to her at Thanksgiving and she said

[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:08.860]   just been doing it that could be the name of a podcast reverse yes everything could be

[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:57.900]   got to do it right when for instance when the stock market goes down that's an opportunity
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:04.700]   not merely to buy but also to do tax loss harvesting a tax efficient investing strategy
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:09.020]   that's complicated but that's why you have betterment on your side they provide unlimited
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:13.460]   expert advice designed to help you make smart financial decisions and I want to point this
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:19.040]   out it's very important they're a fiduciary that's a long complicated word that means
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:24.780]   they have to represent you they're not incentivized to sell funds they don't have their own investment
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:30.580]   products to sell they make recommendations in your best interest the other thing I love

[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:42.220]   your behalf daily hourly month by the minute which sometimes is necessary for tax loss
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:47.020]   harvesting but there's no transaction fees no matter how much money you have to invest

[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:52.980]   betterment.com/twit betterment.com/twit betterment out smart average don't get me started at
[02:02:52.980 --> 02:03:01.060]   my mom's investment advice oh boy he's such a nice guy he has an MBA that's what she said
[02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:04.500]   because I was doing it for right I was helping mom you don't need to do all this will make
[02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:10.220]   it very simple she said no but you don't have an MBA it's an own god he came to the
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:16.220]   house he sat in the living room with me he talked to me he was nice I don't want to
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:21.180]   even ask because because one of the things we had her in mutual funds nicely different
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:27.100]   one of the things he did is he went out and he bought her stock in coke and apple about
[02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:31.700]   six months ago like that wouldn't be a bad move what could be wrong what could possibly
[02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:36.780]   you can buy sugar water and go with apple and change the world yeah kind of is her friend
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:44.700]   John Scully let's see Amazon I was going to talk about this we were talking about what
[02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:49.500]   companies buy and what it tells you about them Disney when they bought Fox Disney owns
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:56.780]   ESPN was told they had to diversify a bunch of sports channels 22 regional sports channels
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:04:03.300]   Amazon wants to buy them is they're bidding on them right now 22 channels including the
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:09.300]   yes network in New York that's the Yankees network man broadcasting games for 40 teams
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:14.260]   from Major League Baseball the NBA NHL this is interesting because Amazon already has
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:20.020]   a deal to stream Thursday night football I haven't watched it on Amazon I watch it on
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:27.660]   real TV but what is real it's literally just rebroadcasting the NFL Network version but
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:34.140]   they did all right last year with the same deal got him 18 million total viewers in 224
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:39.820]   countries cost him 130 million dollars I what is Amazon do they want to get in the
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:44.780]   broadcaster what is the larger goal here I mean they broadcast no but I think they're
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:49.740]   interested in I think all these streaming services are wondering is there a future in
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:55.220]   live sports on streaming because right now live sports is seen as the bastion of the
[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:59.780]   last bastion of traditional broadcast over the top even yeah versus a streaming service
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:05.300]   ESPN is the most expensive cable channel so what I would guess is that they will be out
[02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:11.340]   bid because the livelihood of cable companies depends on these things being on cable otherwise
[02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:14.940]   everybody will divest to the bundle at the same time Amazon's got lots of money they
[02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:20.940]   could spend it and the you probably really if Jeff wants it you can't outbid Amazon the
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:25.460]   challenges are that the RSN's do have cable deals right so they probably even if they
[02:05:25.460 --> 02:05:30.220]   buy these channels they may have to hold on to them for right years before they could
[02:05:30.220 --> 02:05:34.060]   potentially like pull them off of cable and that was the issue with tech TV there were
[02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:39.540]   limits of what we could stream because we're cable channel and cable wants you to watch
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:44.180]   cable by cable but they're experimenting with this and I see why because like live sports
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:48.140]   is one of those things that people who want to see it are going to see it and they will
[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:53.260]   pay for cable just to get their live sports yeah you know when I was doing the book I
[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:59.260]   interviewed Jeff Skoll who is the kind of first CEO of eBay but then famously went down
[02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:05.980]   to Hollywood and now is producing you know Oscar nominations basically and he at the
[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:13.540]   end of the interview he was just yeah he just said it's a just a matter of time before Silicon
[02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:23.180]   Valley just owns owns all the LA owns LA owns every every broadcast anything and I
[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:30.500]   just see this as another step in that direction because as you said you know the no one no
[02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:38.540]   one can outbid Amazon or hell Twitter I think would be you know they bought a live TV type
[02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:43.140]   of stuff would be a smart move you're basically saying if you're a fan of this baseball or
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:46.740]   basketball team that's on this regional sports network and you want to watch most of their
[02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:51.460]   games what you're going to do is just get prime yeah or whatever and or Facebook or
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:56.620]   Twitter or whatever exactly and that you'll then you get it but without it eventually
[02:06:56.620 --> 02:07:01.220]   you won't get it yeah there's no loyalty to the cable networks per say no there's nothing
[02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:06.700]   but enmity it's just team team exactly I like the Yankees on now here's another interesting
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:11.980]   thing we were watching football and Thanksgiving and somebody said you know it's really frustrating
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:17.340]   because the networks cut away from the thing I want to see to show you know the celebration
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:23.140]   dance or I want to see the larger game so I can see the play but instead they're focusing
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:27.580]   on the quarterback and I said I don't think it's a it's going to be long before you get
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:31.580]   to choose the shot yes bands already experimenting with that and that part of that is that they
[02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:35.900]   they have multiple cable channels right they got to be able to do it so so for the for
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:39.860]   the I think it was college was the college football championship game or or something
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:47.300]   like that they did a big game where they they did everything was like you could get the
[02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:51.860]   version of it that was on ESPN that had the regular announcers and the version on ESPN
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:56.760]   too that had the coaches who were analyzing it more and they had an all 12 or all 24
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:01.860]   of you I guess are all are all I guess no 22 12 11 11 guys on that where it's that where
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:06.580]   it's just the whole you can see all the players and and they're just every channel had it
[02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:09.220]   because they figured nobody is going to be watching those channels on the night of the
[02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:14.540]   college football championship game but I I kind of feel like we are we are on the precipice
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:19.340]   and on streaming you could easily do that Amazon's NFL broadcast have an alternate broadcast
[02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:25.140]   that's paid by Amazon that does play by play that separate from the the the network version
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:28.580]   that they've thrown in there so you could have alternate audio streams alternate video
[02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:34.020]   streams were perilously close but it's already being experimented on the World Series or
[02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:37.780]   one of the baseball playoff games ESPN had two broadcasts and it was literally the same
[02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:42.740]   broadcast but one of them had different announcers and they had the the sort of stats oriented
[02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:47.100]   and the kind of old jocks oriented version stats oriented version was amazing by the
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:51.260]   way a way better version I think ESPN may have watched that and said say maybe we should
[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:55.820]   say baby we should change how we do our broadcasting but they didn't have to make fans
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:09:01.380]   choose they got to watch either one I think it's I think that that's something that streaming
[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:05.820]   can bring to the table that cable just can't do very well unless you happen to have five
[02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:09.740]   channels who don't and you're not willing and you're willing to give them all five up exactly
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:17.380]   but Amazon could there's an infinite infinite versions I mean what if you could do your
[02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:22.540]   version of the Super Bowl imagine a twitch you know people are streaming the Super Bowl
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:29.940]   with their commentary yeah who owns twitch I forgot oh Amazon it's amazing right imagine
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:33.780]   if you're in your twitch control panel and you have access to all the cameras and you
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:39.300]   can and I own which my own Super Bowl and you just make that out there and it's legal because
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:44.700]   you've got their ads in it yeah I think that'd be I mean I think that's gonna happen super
[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:49.260]   cool I mean I know why they want to buy the regional sports netwits I don't think it's
[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:55.940]   gonna happen yes eventually eventually sure but like but but the thing is this sports to
[02:09:55.940 --> 02:09:59.880]   go back to what I was saying at the beginning sports rights so valuable because they're this
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:04.480]   last bulwark against everybody cutting the cord like the Dodgers sold the rights to Time Warner
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:10.420]   Cable in LA for like 20 years for tens of billions of dollars and that's the challenge
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:13.840]   in all of this is it's not the technology advancement that's gonna prevent this from
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:17.840]   happening it's the contracts it's the lawyers money and the contracts because a lot of these
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:22.560]   regional sports networks have 20 year rights deals 30 year rights deals and they because
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:28.480]   they knew this day was you know who doesn't have all those rights deals e-sports for tonight
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:32.260]   it's true MMA and a lot of fighting stuff is going to streaming now because they don't
[02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:36.480]   have the long term rights baseball football and basketball be get better be careful because
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:41.180]   they could actually put themselves out of business by holding on too tight baseball has
[02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:47.220]   done a pretty good job of you know I mean Disney bought their streaming service technology
[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:53.100]   because it was so good right but you're right they they're all risking because the next generation
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:57.120]   people is not going to be using cable to watch whatever thing that they're a fan of right
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:02.000]   so if they're not present on modern streaming services I mean that generation of fans will
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:09.240]   be gone baseball already is for old people you know football you know everywhere he goes
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:16.220]   Adam Fisher ladies no I feel like Jason and I are baseball fans it's yeah and it's not
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:20.900]   entirely true if you look at the financials of of baseball baseball is actually everybody
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:24.720]   always says baseball is dying but baseball actually makes a lot a lot of money well how
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:30.440]   about football in this you know head injury problem they have I mean you know with no
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:36.360]   mom is going to let their kids play pop Warner unless they're sure Texas I guess I don't
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:42.920]   know I could see you know sports being something of something I can see Mike Elgin glazing over
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:48.660]   because he is sports like more speaks has no interest in handball but but but but the
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:53.000]   sports stuff is changing for sure I mean this morning I was watching I turn on the TV this
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.320]   morning and they were live broadcast of the English Premier League I know the Bundesliga
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:03.200]   in Germany and siri ah from Italy and it's like American sports channels are now bidding
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:08.280]   for the rights to soccer European soccer yeah part of that part of it is because there
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:12.200]   are people who like soccer Leo I know some of us do like soccer believe it or not growing
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:15.400]   Latino community yeah I know there's a lot I mean that's part of it but there's also
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:19.800]   the Americans are used to watching the best in the world and in soccer the best in the
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:25.200]   world don't play sorry MLS don't play in America and so they do play in Europe and
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:28.840]   they've they've made those sales but what's interesting to me about it trend wise is just
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:34.600]   that is not a sport that was really on anyone's radar in the US and yet there is a huge investment
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:40.760]   in some growth in it because terrible TV sport I'm sorry it can be good in a little
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:45.920]   slow anyway it's also there's nowhere to put commercials well but they've somehow the English
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.880]   Premier League has managed to be survived billions and billions of pounds I know it blows me away
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:55.360]   with these guys make it blows me away so anyway so yeah this I think sports will always be
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:13:00.320]   with us but the nature of the may change and yeah maybe e-sports is the future my son does
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:03.800]   nothing but watch people play video games on YouTube so think about the generation growing
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:07.840]   up you're gonna watch Fortnite is very engaging to watch people play Fortnite is actually
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:12.720]   is much fun and there's no head injuries there might be cheeto overdoses but yeah that's
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:18.440]   yeah you pull up pull a hamstring getting out of the chair at the end all right ladies and
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:23.920]   gentlemen thank you for being here this week it has been a lot of fun Mike Elgin and when
