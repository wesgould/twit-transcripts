[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.040]   the World. Lots to talk about. Apple tells Congress, "You're going to hurt yourself if
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.580]   you try to fix your phone. Are they right? Police can keep that ring camera video forever.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.920]   And why is Honey worth $4 billion? It's all coming up next on Twit."

[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.200]   It's time for Twit. This week in Tech, show we cover the week's tech news. I can't wait
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.960]   to get talking because we're going to have a lot of fun Seth Rosenblatt is here from
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.120]   Electric and he is perfectly timed. No? No, you're not from Electric. You're from the
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.320]   parallax. Thank you. I confuse you with the other Seth. He's from Electric. To you
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:21.840]   mind, forget that we're going to talk about electric vehicles in any way. We're talking
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.440]   about security. The dash parallax.com. I'm sorry, Seth. That was completely a mind. I just got back for vacation. I'm not fully here. Well, you look like you're
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:35.280]   corporally, corporally. Speaking of corporeal, Alex is here. Alex Wilhelm, formerly editor
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.960]   in chief of Crunchbase News. You made the announcement this week. You're leaving Crunchbase News. You actually
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.400]   decided in October and didn't tell me. I agreed to a period of transition helping things
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.920]   kind of smooth from my exit. That's a nice thing to do. I wanted to respect that and give
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.400]   everyone a good chance to find a normal and that ended on Friday. Are you ready to announce
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.040]   your new gig? Because you have a new gig, I understand. I do. I don't want to. But I
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.600]   will just say that I'm still writing and I'm still doing the podcast with TC. The things
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.880]   that people have read of my stuff is still going to be happening. We love it. I hope you'll
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.120]   still be on. Although now, part of the reason you're leaving is because you won't be spending
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.200]   half your life in California. You'll be going back to Providence where your wife lives and
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.780]   now you live. Yes. And that commute must have been killing you. If I never flew United
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.760]   Economy again, it would be fine by me. I have done... Well, I say that and I've only
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   fallen them a hundred times. But I will be trying to come on whenever I'm in town. I
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.800]   will let you guys know and see if I can come up and still take part. So hopefully it won't
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.440]   be too much of a... I hope you will. You know, we love having you on. You know, I shouldn't
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.000]   say this because we have an all in studio panel today. But you can always be on Skype.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.240]   A lot of our hosts are on Skype. I want to make sure my audio is good enough because I
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.240]   did Skype in one time and my audio wasn't good and you were cross with me. I was cross.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.760]   I was saying... I do not want to once again come under the lash. We did a triangulation.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.680]   Really good one if you want to watch it on Friday with Scott Petrie who single-handedly
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.720]   he was Apple product manager for Newton created Postini which single-handedly eliminated
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.080]   the spam threat. Google bought him. It's what Gmail uses. And now is a new company where
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.600]   he's eliminating browser malware with authenticated virtual browser. But Scott wore helicopter
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.880]   pilot headsets with... They really isolate the green ones. The green ones. And he reset
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.400]   the power. Yeah, rewired it for USB. And the... Heeks. We'll do these things. And it sounded
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.240]   great. So we're going to get you a helicopter headset. I guarantee I will wear that if that
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.400]   happens. I will look from the industry. It does not come with a helicopter. Oh, that
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.600]   changed my answer a little bit. Helicopter not included. I'll give you a little bubble
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.120]   thing you can put around. Done. Also, here Mike Galgan off the road once again. Our digital
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.000]   nomad. Hi Mike. How you doing? I'm doing great. Thanks Lee. I'll meet Coffee and Chocolate
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.080]   from Mexico City. That's right. You're always welcome here. Thank you so much. Thank you.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.960]   Where are you going? Where have you been? Well, we are going back to Mexico City in about
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.680]   a week and a half. Nice. Then we're going to El Salvador for the new year. That's where
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.840]   your wife's from. She's originally from El Salvador. We haven't been there many years.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.480]   And we're bringing squishy face, Kevin Nadia with the whole family. We're going... And
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.600]   then we're going to Mexico City again to do another experience next year. Prosecco Hills
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.720]   to do another experience in Provence again. Well, life. It's gastronomad.net. If you want
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.760]   to, yes. Join Mike and Amira on their journeys. Last time you came to our house, Amira brought
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.600]   us some penello, which is kind of raw sugar from El Salvador. That blew my mind. It's
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.240]   so delicious. Put it in everything. She makes a dessert that is basically but butternut squash
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.720]   and penella and vanilla roasted. And you would think you're eating the finest
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.560]   flan you've ever tasted. It's amazing. But it's butternut squash. It's butternut squash
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.480]   and this raw sugar and we roast it and it's... Oh my gosh. It's the first time I've ever
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.640]   actually wanted to eat squash. But now I do want to eat. It will make you a squash fan.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.720]   I guarantee. Because I've been a squash hater for a long time and I got off that for it.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   How do you live in Rhode Island and hate squash? Yeah. You live in the way of squash.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.680]   I'm an aposecatech. Look, wherever I go, I don't fit in. So I might as well just
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.440]   go lean into it a little bit. Liza, do you love squash? She loves squash.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   All right. I mean cook it first but... I don't eat raw squash. So all right, even though you're
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.120]   not the Seth I thought you were, let's talk about... Oh boy. Electric vehicles. There were
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.960]   two big announcements this week. There was one that got a lot of people upset and that was the
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:52.560]   Ford Mustang Mach-E, which doesn't look like a Mustang. It's Ford's first like high-end electric
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.280]   vehicle. I liked it so much I put a deposit down. I was gonna ask about that. Yeah, immediately.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   Yeah. Wow. Because it basically they cribbed the Tesla Model X. They have the big screen in the
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:09.840]   middle except it's got a knob on it. It's very a Ford slant on the Tesla. But I think it looks like
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.360]   a great vehicle and unlike Tesla they probably have parts. They probably can get parts fixed.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.840]   You probably don't have a crazy... Is that me talking? Not me. I think it's your butt.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.240]   Yeah, sure. It's not. You know, I must have said the... It's a pretty julienne. It's really julienne.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.920]   He's here. Yeah, I know. And Lila is now the cybersecurity expert for the president.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.520]   So it's a series that says she's very fond of better job. Well, thank you for chiming in.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.960]   Thank you, sir. It's great to get all the perspective. The funny thing is she was way back there.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.200]   I don't know how she even heard that. That's impressive. The Mach-E. But that's really not
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.800]   the news. They got completely eclipsed by once again Elon Musk and the Cybertruck. Yes. What do you
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:59.120]   think of that? Book Reef. Yes. It looks like an urban assault vehicle. I want a Mach-E because I
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.760]   like the idea of an electric muscle car. To me that seems very American and I like it. It doesn't
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.720]   look like a Mustang traditionally but it's very attractive. If you sit... If you look at the cockpit
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.800]   it actually reminds me a lot of my... Because I used to have a Mustang for a long time before.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.040]   Oh really? Mustang. Bright-red 5.0 GT 2009 Mustang. 2009 Mustang.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.640]   And it looks the same. So it's weird and the lights are the same. So they've got some Mustang touch
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.600]   but it's a crossover. It's not a muscle car, a sports car of any kind. But here's the funny thing.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.200]   And I don't know if this really got a lot of attention. They have recordings that play
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.160]   in the cabin while you're driving to make you feel like you're driving a Mustang. There's three
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.120]   levels. There's a relaxed level which is kind of... That's just loco. But when you turn it up to the
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:52.160]   like aggressive driving level it's got clunks, it's got clunks, it's got muscle car sounds
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.920]   playing into the cabin. Are they live or are they recording? No no no they're recording.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.320]   Because they're... Electric vehicle's silent. In fact one of the problems with electric vehicles
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.960]   is it's... You know pedestrians can't hear you coming. Especially blind pedestrians can't.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.920]   Yeah right. So a lot of electric vehicles now have some sort of sound especially at low speeds.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.040]   And I imagine these sounds are piped outside as well. I don't know. But the Mach-E is quick.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:23.600]   It's a fast vehicle. It is as... Especially their high end they have one high end expensive model
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.560]   that is zero to 60 in three seconds. Yeah see that's why I want it. Isn't the real question how
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.920]   many polygons the Mach-E has? No that's the cyber truck. Well we know how many polyclicks right
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:41.840]   are. We can't... We can't help them. Yeah no the Mach-E like all other modern cars the metal is
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.440]   so I don't understand metal. Yeah. Metalurgy exactly. But to get those soft things I guess that's a
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.960]   lot of work. The way the cyber truck is made it's made out of three millimeter thick
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.600]   hard rolled stainless steel. So it's apparently very hard. And they just you know you put a little
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.400]   crease in the bed. And so there's no soft lines at all. It looks like polygons. Yeah.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.200]   When they debuted the Mach-E did anyone take a sledgehammer to the windows? No.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.520]   Okay I feel a little bad for Elon. I think there was a misunderstanding. I understand.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:25.040]   Yeah they rolled the wrong truck on stage. Well the windshield is armored right. It's a it's
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.760]   multi-layered polymer and it's apparently is very impervious. Yeah. Elon didn't get the memo that the
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:39.120]   side windows are just glass. So he had his chief designer have to shot with Klaus or someone. Klaus
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.480]   huffed it a shot put the side of a baseball through it and whoops it broke. And then they laugh so
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.400]   awkwardly. Well it threw Elon I think the biggest mistake Elon made was well okay let's try the other
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:59.440]   window. Which they did. And let's let's try it again. Maybe that one will not break. So Klaus
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.800]   throw it again. Let's show him that it won't break. So then what they didn't think of is Elon now
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.120]   has to do the entire rest of the presentation with a broken car with two broken windows.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.280]   And every once and it completely threw him. I mean his presentation was completely thrown.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.800]   And every once in a while you can see him look over his shoulder at the hole in the window.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:25.600]   He said we'll fix it in post on stage which was hilarious. But then they did put out a video
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.640]   of them before the show trying it trying it and it worked on those windows on the side window of
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:36.880]   the car. I guarantee you that Tesla will sell stickers that place those same broke broken rolls.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.680]   So you can have a Tesla. That's really. Yeah exactly. And the cost 50 bucks each. Exactly. And the
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.880]   whole margin on the car. So so worse than the than the windows which are funny. Who is who
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.720]   actually drives a pickup truck and uses it in a pickup capacity that is looking at this thing
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:59.440]   and saying oh I need that in my life. I mean you can't do anything with it. How many orders did they
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.480]   take? 146,000. I think was I think was a mistaken it was a missed opportunity because
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.720]   with the capacitor they have. That's your answer. Yeah exactly. Instead of the pickup truck they
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.760]   should have filled that with batteries and then put a solar panel on the top and you have an electric
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.720]   vehicle that can go coast to coast without on a single charge. That would have been amazing.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.120]   Now I don't know but it looked like so they have a hatch on the back. Yeah which opens. In fact they
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.800]   showed at the end one more thing an ATV designed to go in the hatch. That's. Oh yeah. That this was
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.360]   like a transformer from 1983. It's like a little lily that can. And then it's funny because the
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.760]   driver of the ATV plugs it into the bed of the pickup so it could be charging while you're driving
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.400]   around. But look at this back. I think that back actually could have solar panels maybe. I don't know.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:49.120]   Certainly should. It looked like it kind of looked like it did. So I don't know. But you can't generate
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.240]   enough electricity with solar panels to. No but you can maybe extend it a bit. And you have a
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.800]   pocket at night and the sun will come out. It's just the two shattered windows as they show off. Is this sad?
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.200]   Okay so sad. But this is not. At least on the other side and then they could.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.280]   They should have spun it. But this is not designed for people who want to have a serious truck to
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.800]   drive to a work site. It's for the people who buy those like AR-15s with all the extra kit on them.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.360]   People who want to look tough. Not people actually use this stuff. Like no one who goes to actual
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.000]   construction sites that are showing up in the cyber truck because they'll get laughed off the
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.080]   site. It's literally a road warrior vehicle. In the worst way possible. Or the best way possible.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.600]   I still want one. I'm going to make fun of it. I want one. Oh absolutely. Now he
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.200]   announced a price of $40,000 which is probably undoable. Yeah. It won't be available for two
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.880]   years. Nevertheless. And they're going to have to stick side mirrors on it somewhere.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.040]   Because otherwise it won't be streetless. No it's not legal. Although I'm wondering if in a couple
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:50.400]   of years finally the Department of Transportation will say okay cameras cameras. In Europe you can
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.200]   and there are cars with little screens and instead of having mirrors they have cameras. And I
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:01.360]   you know the Ford doesn't have door handles. Did you hear about the brake pedal on the
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.680]   cyber truck? No. Have it doesn't have one? I read tweets about this. It doesn't have
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.080]   I read an interview with Elon that said he doesn't have a record. If you run into somebody you're
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.640]   going to win. I don't know if that was the logic but it's one of those things that here's what I
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.240]   like about it. What is it do to stop just I think it's supposed to be intelligent to do it for you.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.200]   You're hanging your foot out the door. I think you're screaming terror.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.880]   And the louder you scream the more it stops. But here's what I like about it. It's fun to make
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:30.320]   fun of. It looks like a doom video game sprite. It has no detail. It looks very low-round. It's not
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.560]   practical. It's to give you cost more money. But here's Tesla just being weird. And going out there
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.360]   and doing stuff that no one else is going to do Ford made a crossover. Well, you know, they made this.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:45.440]   This is what I would say in response to all of this is it's Elon. He thinks he's living in a
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.120]   simulation. He takes drugs. He does not think about who's going to buy this. Right. And do you
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.400]   know which ones? I've seen him do it. All of them. Well, we saw him smoke on joint on exactly Joe
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.960]   Joe Rogan. But I think he's taking hallucinogenics a lot more. But nevertheless, who cares? Elon
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:09.680]   is the kind of entrepreneur who says, I'm just going to do it. I don't think about who wants this
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.760]   or whether that's a showstopper. I don't think he's really thinking about a market. He says,
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.840]   this is what needs to be done. And I like it. And I bet you there are other people. And he's right
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.080]   because they've got a lot of orders for it. I would buy it if I needed to pick up.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:28.800]   Imagine arriving at the job site in this thing. You'd be the envy of all your coworkers.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   Do you still have a model X? I don't. And I'll tell you why I decided I want the Ford instead of a
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.360]   Model X. My Model X lease ran out. I turned it back. I'm never again buying a gas vehicle. I
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.960]   really maul in, especially here in California on the EVs. But I don't trust Tesla because
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:50.320]   Elon lives in a simulation and he doesn't. He's not worried. So you've heard maybe you've heard
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:57.280]   the rumors that if you break a window on your Model X or three or S, it could be up to three
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.200]   to six months before you get a replacement. Now, if that's the windshield, you're not driving
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.360]   the car for that time. And there's a lot of other little things like that. Tesla's not a car
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.600]   company. It's a software company. My wife always said, we're driving a beta. And she's kind of
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.840]   right. The door would hit her in the head. She didn't like that too much. She'll fix it later.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.880]   No one likes that. The goal, the stock on wing on the Model X, if it was raining,
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:29.840]   when you open the door, the gap would suddenly pour a sheet of water down the side because it
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:35.440]   was trapping the water. And then as you get out, you'd be walking through a waterfall. There's
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.240]   little things like that that honestly, Elon doesn't care. I don't think they care. They want to change
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:45.360]   the world and they have vision and make our two of them. Like all car companies, they make
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.320]   concept cars except Tesla. They sell them. Right. That's what cyber customers. It's a concept.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.440]   People keep buying them. They're still building battery factors in China and Europe.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.280]   I love my Model X. I didn't mind that it was beta.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.600]   Because I'm a geek. And so that model of vehicle as software, where you're constantly
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   updating, constantly iterating, if it breaks, and this happened, you'd get updates.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.680]   Things would break a week later to get fixed. It was like software.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.720]   Well, the difference with, I mean, not to be a negative Nancy here, but the difference with
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.880]   vehicles when they're beta and they ship and they're on the road is that they kill people.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:26.240]   One of the problems with this is that you actually want
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.400]   computer-aided driving or fully computerized driving on the roads. You want to have the added
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:39.520]   level of safety that Google and others have been promising since 2013. But the problem is,
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.680]   is that they're not there yet and they're putting these vehicles on the road, which is,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.840]   I think in the long run, actually going to harm the rate of adoption because they're not road ready.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.360]   In Tesla's defense, they sell very safe cars. I mean, Teslas are safe.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:01.200]   They're driving. Well, they're very aggressive about rolling out and driving,
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.480]   so it was big safety. Ideas.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.920]   I felt safe in the Model X.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.440]   Where's the industry? How many people are you?
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:14.160]   You can't blame a company like GM or something like that for all the people who die because they
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.800]   haven't been aggressive in rolling out new safety features.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.760]   Let's not forget.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.120]   But Ford shipped a vehicle that burst into flames when we're ended.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:29.760]   And looking at the number of people who die in car crashes across the United States,
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:36.800]   as a percentage, I'm pretty sure it's lower than it was in 1980 when there were no safety
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:42.160]   features and seatbelts were optional. So in that sense, there has been improvement over time,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.040]   but now that we're getting computers involved, my fear is that people will become afraid of
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:52.880]   computer-aided driving when we know that on the whole it's going to improve things.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.200]   We have 30,000 some odd people get killed in car crashes every year,
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.400]   and it's not broken out as to whether they're pedestrian or in the car or whatever.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.680]   But ultimately, we can benefit from this if it's being done in a way that I think
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.200]   takes into consideration pedestrians, takes into consideration other people on the road.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.920]   And we don't have that. And that's what worries me.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.640]   And we see what happened with Uber a year and a half ago.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.280]   It was just about to say.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.360]   We're going to talk about that, actually, a little bit because the final investigation is finished.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.320]   Yeah. And it was found that it was human error.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.760]   What a shot.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.040]   Well, it was the safety. I guess we were talking about now the safety driver.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.160]   And we knew this because there's a video of the safety driver not paying attention.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.600]   Sure. Looking down or something. They were watching safety driving.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:45.120]   But also, Uber's software didn't account for pedestrians anywhere but in the crosswalks.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:51.200]   It didn't help that the woman who was run over walked into traffic in a poorly lit area.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:57.600]   She was apparently on meth because she had a very high level of methadrine in her bloodstream
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:03.440]   plus some marijuana. So she was a homeless person. She kind of stumbled into the street,
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.640]   but a normal driver would have not hit her.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   Yeah. And that was an area where the crosswalks were over a quarter of a mile apart.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.520]   Yeah, I can't blame it.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.960]   It was people would have probably happens is people who even are not on drugs are crossing
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.480]   there because that's where as a community, the people want to go.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.520]   That's where they need to cross.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.000]   It's not a pedestrian-friendly area.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.360]   Yeah, that's an understatement.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:33.760]   But just to go back to Tesla, one of the innovations is their documentation of everything.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.560]   They use the sensors on the car to figure out everything that happened.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.520]   They zap that back to headquarters and they crunch that information.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.320]   That also bugged me because they know exactly what I do.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.120]   But if there's an accident, they say, "Well, why was it an accident?"
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.240]   They know why and they can-
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.240]   Again, they treat it as software.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.200]   Exactly right. They're getting telemetry and they're improving their software.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.440]   I think Tesla's a safe vehicle. I think if they did something wrong, it's marketing it as autopilot.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.560]   Which it does not.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.720]   It's not. And so I as a Tesla driver never treated it as such.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.320]   I treated it as driver-assist, lane-keeping, adaptive cruise control.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.960]   That's what other companies call these technologies.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.080]   That's fine. And there is a one feature that I didn't really like,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.520]   which is if you hit the turn signal in autopilot, it'll change lanes for you.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.800]   I tried it once and it cut off a car behind me because it didn't judge the distance properly.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.080]   And I never used it again.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:33.040]   So the fact that you are approaching your Tesla experience from a more rational point of view
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.320]   does not seem to be the way that one, they're marketing it, which is a big problem.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:36.880]   That's the big problem.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.760]   And two, that people are actually applying it.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.560]   We know that there are people who are seeing that there's crashes and everything from people
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.760]   because they put on their autopilot and they think it's a full self-driving car.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:47.760]   Right.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:54.240]   And it's not. And ultimately, it's going to be people who are going to die and get killed.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:02.160]   And that's what I think is the real concern here is Tesla is innovating perhaps in some ways
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.840]   and how they're building cars and how they're treating them as mobile computers, which is good.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.920]   But the marketing is chaotic and leading to bad driver behavior.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.160]   And ultimately, it is people behind the wheel of these vehicles.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:24.400]   And until we change our insurance industry, that's how crashes are going to be blamed
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.720]   for whomever owns the vehicle or is the driver.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.640]   I want to give Tesla a lot of credit because they jump started at the EV movement.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.520]   I give EVs of the right solution. They reduce pollution.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.320]   I think they're a good, they're lower maintenance. They're really a good solution.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:38.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.920]   And so Tesla and Elon get a lot of credit for long before anybody else believed in it,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.240]   stepping up and showing people will buy these. However,
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.960]   there are problems. Seth, you showed us this tweet.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.960]   So remember, you may remember there was a whistleblower at Tesla.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.800]   Mark Martin trip.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.760]   Yeah. What was he whistleblowing on?
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.880]   Safety. It was safety related stuff that was happening in the manufacturing of cars that they
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.560]   didn't want the information to get out.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.000]   So Tesla's response, according to, oh, this is a police report from the Story
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.640]   County Sheriff's Department of Virginia, sitting in Nevada.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:26.000]   According to this report, Tesla, not only did they like try to shut this guy up in a lot of other
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.080]   ways, they tried to have him swatted, arrested, and placed on a mental health hold.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.920]   Now talk about low behavior.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.520]   It's about as bad as it gets because you can die to a swatting.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.360]   That's not a joke.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.040]   Well, it's highly illegal.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.680]   That too.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:49.520]   And the fact that the police who handled this case, who were called in,
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:55.680]   did not actually shoot this guy and did not respond aggressively to the swatting claim,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.560]   and instead took a very measured approach, is I think remarkable.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.920]   More and more, we've been swatted. And more and more police departments are recognizing that
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.480]   this is often, quote, prank, a very, very dangerous prank.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:14.800]   The police report said that Tesla's call center called them because they said they'd received a
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.280]   phone call, which a female subject stated she was friends with Martin Trip, described him as
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.320]   being heavily armed and distraught, was on his way to shoot up Tesla.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.360]   So they said, the good news is they sent an intelligent deputy, chief deputy, Dosen,
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.920]   who went there to see if he could make contact.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.600]   They did not send the SWAT team.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.640]   They did not send a bus of heavily armed police with armor, body armor in.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.800]   And so he wasn't harmed, but this is a police report.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.400]   So I think this is fairly credible.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.080]   Well, Elon has a history of lashing out against the wrong people.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.000]   There's the diver from--
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.880]   Right, the Pito--
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:49.920]   --he was calling it--
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.560]   Accusational.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.120]   Yep, exactly.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.320]   So this was enough to-- this was also kind of part of the reason why I thought,
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.520]   I'm not sure I want to support-- I support what Tesla's thing is.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   But I can't really support this company any longer.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.640]   Their leadership is overly aggressive in the wrong ways.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.400]   And so if they could fix that part of it-- because I think the marketing we're talking about
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:16.000]   of the safety features as autopilot, et cetera, that's part of this super aggressive attitude
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:16.720]   about everything.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.920]   And if they could just--
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.320]   Well, look at the cyber truck.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.960]   It's designed to carry weaponry.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.840]   I mean, honestly, there's going to be somebody who buys this and arms the hell out of it.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.760]   But if you put a little child on the back, you got to have a tank.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.120]   It looks like a military vehicle.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.920]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:32.960]   Oh, good.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.640]   That would be popular in Mexico City, I'm sure.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.440]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.120]   It's armor.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.160]   You could shoot at it.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:38.560]   Right.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.680]   It's an armored vehicle.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.960]   Just don't throw a shot put out the windows.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.360]   Exactly.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:41.680]   That's the--
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.640]   --is vulnerability.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.840]   But for the longest time, Elon was a benefit to Tesla.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.680]   His call to personality, brought in attention, his antics got media hype,
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.760]   and the cars were essentially cars.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.360]   But in this case, now the argument I think we're making as a group is that his personality is
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.040]   now a detriment to the corporation itself and it forces us to trust the--
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.280]   He did say he was stepping back from Twitter.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.960]   He's not going to use it as much.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.320]   I've said that before too.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.440]   Never been true.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.000]   I've said it.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.560]   We've all said it.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.120]   We've all said it.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:07.120]   We've all said it.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.200]   You quit publicly like four times.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.040]   I can't quit it because I have half a million followers and I've been told many, many times
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.320]   about my marketing team.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.760]   Why would you quit?
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.040]   I don't actually think Twitter is that useful for publicity or for anything else.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.360]   So I actually have a really quick aside.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:31.840]   There's a lot of great threads that occur on info sec Twitter, in the cybersecurity community.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.480]   And I've been able to convince one of the authors of one of these threads
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.480]   to convert the thread into an opinion column.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:40.960]   Yes.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:48.720]   Which was a very-- I mean it was a very non-controversial column.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.760]   It was about how an EMV chip works in your credit card.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.840]   But the problem that I have with Twitter threads is that they exist only on Twitter.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.200]   Why do people write a medium post or a blog post and put it
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.920]   to under characters at a time on Twitter?
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.640]   It's the worst possible way to publish.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.200]   Exactly.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.440]   I don't understand it.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:05.760]   Exactly.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.080]   It's limited and it doesn't have the reach that you want for a lot of these things.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:16.160]   Seth Abramson, the author who's been doing a lot of investigative journalism
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.800]   great work into Trump, he goes on these threads which are phenomenal.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.160]   But I'd rather see them as an op-ed in the post or in the times or any other legitimate
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:32.880]   news source because the reach will far outstrip however many thousands or even hundreds of thousands
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.240]   of people retweet them.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.080]   It's not going to have an impact if it's limited to the Twitter sphere.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.240]   It baffles me.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.040]   I think Twitter people-- it's overvalued.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.760]   I think people for some reason think it's more valuable than it is.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.280]   And I just don't think stuff you post on Twitter has the reach you think it has.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.920]   Even if I post for my quote half million followers, first of all half of them are bots.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:01.440]   Second, of the 250,000 who are not bots, how many of them are on Twitter at that moment?
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.080]   Twitter has tried to fix that.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.160]   So this is an app I use called Threader, Threader.app that creates threads out of--
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.320]   here's Seth Abramson's thread.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.600]   It creates threads out of multi-tweet posts.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.120]   But why should this exist?
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.080]   Why does this have to exist?
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.120]   I'll tell you why it exists.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.120]   Because people don't leave Twitter.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.520]   If you put a link to an article-- see, in a perfect world, everyone would post wherever they
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.400]   want to.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.800]   And then Twitter would be the social network.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.760]   We just go read this over here, read that over there.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.720]   That's how it should work.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.280]   But we all know if you look at the engagement numbers on a tweet when you have a link,
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.600]   I got-- I have 36,000 followers on Twitter or something like that.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.720]   Not great, not bad.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.560]   I post a link to something, and five people will look on the link.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.640]   5,000 will see the tweet.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.920]   That's why people do Twitter threads, because people don't want to leave Twitter.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.800]   And that's a problem.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.520]   You know what?
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.120]   Google should create a social network.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.080]   Oh, no.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.920]   Again, that's a great idea.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.880]   It's only--
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.000]   How many have they failed at?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.840]   I know, it's 12.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.320]   Google, wait a minute.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.200]   They've already got the record.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:09.760]   Why not?
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.560]   Yeah, keep it up.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.600]   I want you to--
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.360]   No, my stuff should do phones.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.160]   Yes.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.520]   That's brilliant.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.680]   Microsoft is doing phones.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.800]   Don't use the P word.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.360]   Don't use the P word.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.560]   Don't use the P word.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.400]   So I just want you to touch my underwear, Alex.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.200]   Oh, dear God.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.760]   Nothing would make me happier in my entire life.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.200]   I've waited for this moment.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.000]   Neither of the mind.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.960]   Do you know Mac Weldon?
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.920]   Do you know about Mac Weldon?
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.560]   I do not.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   They make underwear, they make socks, they make shirts and undershirts, hoodies and sweatpants,
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.880]   starting with these performance fabrics, innovative fabrics,
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.200]   that each have their own unique purposes and story.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.760]   For instance, silver is antimicrobial.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.480]   That's right.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.360]   So no odor.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.640]   You feel cool and fresh all day.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.880]   It doesn't feel like it's made of metal.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.840]   I'm not saying that.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.720]   It's very fine.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.080]   Silver threads.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.640]   In fact, they have this in their underwear and they also have it in their shirts.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.240]   That is so cool.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.120]   Literally.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:01.680]   Cool.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.000]   Whether you're working out, going to your job or out in a date,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.120]   they look good, they fit well, they never smell, and they last forever.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.240]   And by the way, there's no challenge to trying this because if you get a pair of underwear from
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.320]   Mac Weldon and you don't like it, keep it, they'll refund you, no questions asked.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:20.800]   Look at that.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.560]   That is, you're going to need this.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.880]   I'm going to give you this for Providence because winter is coming and it's going to be,
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.400]   you have no, he has no idea.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.440]   It doesn't know what winter is.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.560]   He has no idea.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.240]   He's a California boy.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.880]   He's going to go to Rhode Island and you're going to actually,
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.400]   fortunately, Providence doesn't get that cold.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:43.040]   But this is like long underwear. This is a very thin, pliable, comfortable fabric
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.880]   that will insulate you like you won't believe.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.360]   You could actually just walk around in the middle of winter with a shirt and this is an
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.440]   undershirt and you'd never get cold.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.600]   It's going to change your life.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.920]   He's going to walk around with the underwear and the shirt and that's it.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.480]   That's all he means.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.400]   That's what he calls it their warm knit.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:05.120]   And you see, it's got the warm knit fabric and your skin and your body heat is insulated and
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.040]   entreped. But moisture is not.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.800]   It is wicked away from you.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.640]   I used to have to wear wool to do that, but please don't wear wool underwear.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.320]   It's scratchy as all get out.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.560]   This is not scratchy.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.360]   This is comfy.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.520]   I am a big Mac welding fan.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.320]   It's a premium men's essentials brand that believes in smart design premium fabrics.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:31.520]   And the reason they advertise on Twit because they know you guys are high tech aficionados.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.640]   And so you are going to be open to the idea that there is a better technology for clothing.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.920]   And this is it Mac Weldon, M-A-C-K-W-E-L-D-O-N.com.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.040]   If you use a promo code to it, you'll get 20% off your first order today.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.640]   And like I said, no risk if you don't like your first pair of underwear, keep it.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.320]   That will refund you every penny.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.160]   MacWeldon.com promo code to it 20% off your first order.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:03.120]   If you are smart enough to understand the tech of performance and clothing, then you will love
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.640]   MacWeldon. You also enjoy it.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   Maximum breathability, four-way stretch, air-knit technology, and silver.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.240]   One small correction, though, to that, which is that you said winter is coming in Providence.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.440]   Winter has its arrived.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.000]   Is it cold?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.400]   It's cold.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:18.800]   It's cold.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.240]   We flew back to California.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.080]   We were like, oh my gosh, blue sky is nice.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.200]   I always forgot this.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.640]   I missed fall, though.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   See, I grew up in Providence.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.000]   I grew up in your house, actually.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.720]   Let's be fair.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.920]   Literally.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.640]   This is a long story, but Alex is living in my childhood home in Providence.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.520]   Leo haunts me at night.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.800]   It's not very pleasant.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.520]   Just stay away.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.320]   You can disable those elections.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.040]   From the bedroom on the third floor to the right.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.360]   Just stay away.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.320]   Anyways, it's cold there.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.240]   And I don't like it.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.200]   I like fall.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.480]   Now they used to, in my day, rake up the leaves.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.600]   They're done kind of.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.480]   This is the end of that season.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.240]   They put them in a big pile and they burn them.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.120]   They don't do that anymore.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:55.600]   No.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.000]   But that, to me, is fall as the smell of burning leaves.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.080]   But the thing is, this year, on the east coast,
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.320]   we went from a pretty good summer.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.320]   And then there was a week when all the trees died.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.600]   And now it's just cold.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.880]   Well, my mom's still in the area, so I'll send her over.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.400]   Anyway.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.240]   Mac Weldon, I'm telling you, you need Mac Weldon?
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:12.880]   You'd be happy.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.600]   I don't want to be cold.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.920]   We brought up something I wanted to--
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:21.760]   They got-- apparently they got the guy from the Chuckling Club.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.040]   Right, Seth? What's that called? The Chuckling Guild? The Chuckling Club?
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.880]   Don't look at me like that.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.160]   The guys who hacked--
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.920]   Jack's Twitter account.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.960]   Jack's Twitter account.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.840]   Oh, squad.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.320]   Okay.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.040]   Chuckling Squaw.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:33.840]   Yes, sorry.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.240]   Sorry.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:34.880]   Squad goals.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.600]   Took a moment.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:35.840]   Yes.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.600]   Not the Chuckles.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.480]   Not the South of the ice.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.680]   I am, but I wasn't sure-- like how we got from--
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.200]   I was still in Providence, Rhode Island.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.080]   [laughter]
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:44.480]   I know.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.400]   There is no conversation dreaming of us.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.760]   So this is from motherboard.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.000]   And actually, this kind of bothers me.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.160]   You tell me if I'm nuts.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.960]   Authorities arrest alleged member of the group that hacked Jack Dorsey.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   The Chuckling Squad.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.360]   How do they know he was a member?
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.080]   Because the leader of the Chuckling Squad told them.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.200]   That seems a little odd.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.120]   Doesn't it?
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.080]   So he was--
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.600]   He was ratted out by his own team.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.000]   I don't know.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.240]   The alleged member was arrested around two weeks ago.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.120]   This is motherboard.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.960]   One of the leaders of the Chuckling Squad,
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.280]   who goes by the handle debug, told motherboard.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.640]   Quote, "He was a member of Chuckling Squad,
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.840]   but not anymore.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.440]   He was an active member for us
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.920]   by providing celebs, public figure,
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.520]   phone numbers, and helping us hack them."
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.240]   That's we know how Jack Dorsey got hacked.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.720]   They, Sims swapped his phone number,
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.280]   and then used a feature now disabled on Twitter
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.440]   to post from his phone number, didn't do any authentication.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.720]   The 404.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.400]   Ability to text in.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.680]   It doesn't authenticate because it says,
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.520]   well, it must be you because it's your phone number.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.120]   Oh, that's a really interesting flaw.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.160]   Because that was a Twitter got started,
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.520]   but you would test that number.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.480]   I used to use it all the time.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.200]   Gosh, that's--
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:49.840]   404.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.160]   So.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.000]   So they disabled it after Jack got hacked.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.920]   But Seth, when somebody's arrested because they're a hacker,
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.840]   and the leader of their group says, yeah, that's him.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.200]   To me, that sounds like that's not him.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.080]   Why would debug turn in in his one of his own homies?
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.120]   Oh, who knows?
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.160]   I mean, he didn't like it.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.000]   I don't think there could be any number of reasons
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.800]   that there was some sort of infighting in the group.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.440]   Maybe he was caught.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.640]   I think that's what happened.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.080]   I mean, I can't speak to this from any investigating that I've done.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.240]   But--
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.640]   This is what debug said.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.160]   I mean, he said, this guy would be weird.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.080]   Swatting celebrities for a follow back.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:43.120]   So maybe the chuckling squad and their high standards for membership.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.400]   Yeah, I was about to say.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.280]   You had to be pretty weird for this crew.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.640]   Name the chuckling squad.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.760]   You have to be able to chuckle.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.400]   Oh.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:50.960]   He starters.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.720]   They threw him out because he was weird.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.680]   So--
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.600]   Wow.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.720]   I mean, what kind of weird do you have to be to get booted from a group like that?
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.520]   From a guy like the squad?
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.120]   I have no idea.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.160]   Anyway, it's not much to say he was busted by React.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.360]   We've heard about React before.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:11.520]   This is the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office special tech squad.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.840]   They're elioteness tech squad.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.160]   Regional enforcement allied computer team.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.720]   And it's a bunch of people, sheriffs and other in the area.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.080]   And the only reason I know this name is because these were the guys
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.280]   who banged at broke down Brian Lambsdore when he had the stolen iPhone.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:29.840]   Oh, well--
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.520]   These are the guys Steve Jobs called out.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.800]   The stolen iPhone.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.320]   The found iPhone.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.600]   Yeah, I don't think it was stolen.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.280]   He bought it from the guy who found it.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:37.440]   Yes.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.880]   But anyway, he got rouseded by React.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.280]   And React specializes in sim swapping.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.560]   So that's their thing.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.200]   That's their thing.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.360]   So that's part of the reason why this was on their radar.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:47.840]   They should.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.280]   Could you explain to idiots what sim swapping is?
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.000]   Because I have an idea, but I'm not entirely sure I have it correct in my head.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.720]   Well, do you have a sim?
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.160]   Let me give you mine.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.200]   And you can give me yours.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:57.760]   A Monverizon.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.280]   No, Seth explains sim swapping.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.000]   No, I mean, that's it.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.960]   Sim swapping is when you are able to--
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.920]   When you physically swap sims.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.480]   I don't know how--
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.120]   It's usually done--
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.720]   How sim swapping works with e-sims, though.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.760]   Yeah, it's usually done by social engineering.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.520]   So a bad guy will call your phone company.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.680]   Let's say-- but you need to-- it's a targeted attack.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.560]   So they need to know--
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   And this is why they need your name.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.360]   They need your number.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.400]   They need your number.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.960]   So I call up say, "Hey, I'm as Jack Dorsey."
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.520]   Or maybe it's Jack Dorsey's assistant.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.400]   And Mr. Dorsey has lost his phone.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.040]   Can you send us another sim?
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.520]   And now remember these customer service people are customer service people.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.640]   So they're going to say, "Well, sure, we have the number--
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.600]   the address on file."
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.400]   Oh, no.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.800]   Can you send it to work because Jack needs it?
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.600]   In fact, if you could courier it over to work, that would be great.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.520]   Here's the address.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   And that way they get your sim.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.400]   Now they're your number.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:54.880]   They're you.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.480]   Things like that.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.640]   It's social engineering focused on a particular
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.840]   outlay of the technology.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.320]   Right.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.120]   But it's pretty hard to do.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.160]   You can't do this on a whim.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.880]   You have to work pretty hard to get someone.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.280]   Well, that's why it's used to target celebrity.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:09.680]   Right.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.120]   And his own Jack Dorsey, who's attack--
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:11.600]   Ansel.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.000]   Will Helm.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.480]   Exactly.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.200]   Do you think the Lord, I do not qualify for anyone to care that much about me?
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.680]   One way to especially avoid this, and I recommend this anybody listening,
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.520]   is to make sure you have a pin number with your cell carrier.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.440]   Most cell carriers will allow you to do that, but it's not set by default.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.120]   If you have a pin number, then they'll say,
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.680]   "Oh, sure, Mr. Dorsey's assistant, and what's his pin number?"
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.440]   And stopped.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.320]   Okay.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.200]   Embarrassing, though, for someone who's in charge of a lot of other people's security,
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.440]   do you be hacked in such an obvious manner?
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.400]   Well, it was.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.640]   And React got him.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.520]   They got the man.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:53.520]   Anyway, that was the other Twitter story I wanted to mention.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.040]   I don't think there are any others.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:55.360]   How about--
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:55.600]   Let's--
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.160]   Alex, is there something--
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.480]   Alex got here like an hour early and was preparing.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.280]   Yes.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.400]   Which I thought was wild.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.000]   I've never seen anybody do that.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.640]   Well, on this show, there are a diversity of topics,
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.280]   and I like to have something in my head about each one.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:13.680]   Okay.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.280]   So when they come up, it's not just Mike telling me things.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.680]   So you've--
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:15.840]   What--
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.240]   I didn't try them in.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.560]   Well, we need Mike to tell us things, but you've read the stories.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:18.720]   It's one that--
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.080]   It's one about Stadia.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.120]   I thought you might.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.360]   Because this is something that I was very excited about when they announced it.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.720]   If you don't know Stadia as--
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.600]   They were back in the old days when Sun put out those little like blades,
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.000]   and you could just log into your computing environment from anywhere.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.040]   Like a thin client.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.360]   A thin client or a thin PC, they recall.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.240]   Imagine that terrible idea that never took off back in the 90s,
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.600]   now with fast interactions and gaming.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.200]   So instead of booting up your PS4 like I do after two weeks,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.280]   and all the games updated and taken forever,
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:49.920]   Oh, I hate that.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.600]   You just log on to Stadia theoretically, and then off you go.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.240]   Now, if you're an adult with a job and stuff,
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.480]   your consoles are off and off for a period of time,
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.760]   and you want to game occasionally,
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.160]   Stadia, I thought would be a good outlet for it.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:02.880]   The issue is--
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.000]   By the way, just before you go with the issue,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.600]   this is not a new idea.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.720]   It's been around for a while.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.680]   Remember online?
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.040]   I was like, oh yeah, online.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.280]   They tried to do it and failed for some economic reasons.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.720]   They couldn't have enough servers to handle the peak traffic.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.560]   Google, I'm sorry, a Sony bought a company called Guy Kai,
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.960]   and Sony has a service that does this.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.200]   Microsoft announced their XCloud service,
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.600]   which will be based on Azure, which will do this.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.040]   What's interesting about Stadia,
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.240]   it's not particularly the technology, is that it's from Google.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.080]   With no history in gaming whatsoever.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.920]   What's the difference, obviously,
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.520]   showing my non-gaming colors here,
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.240]   but between Stadia and Steam?
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.280]   So Steam is a store, essentially,
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.200]   in a place where you can go and purchase games that will work
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.120]   mostly on the PC or on VR.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.440]   Stadia is an environment where you can play games,
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.760]   I believe for a variety of systems, but through the internet.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.720]   So on Stadia, I could play Destiny 2,
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.880]   just like I do on my PS4, but I don't have to have a console,
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.200]   and it should always be updated and fast.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.880]   The issue is, which everyone already knew
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.080]   was going to be the problem,
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.040]   if you don't have a blistering the perfect internet connection,
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.880]   or Stadia itself is a little bit laggy, this doesn't work.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.960]   And the response that I read from all the gaming reviewers
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.200]   that I trust is that it's cool, but it feels very beta.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.160]   It's not quite there yet.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.640]   I paid for the Founders edition and canceled it
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.040]   days before it was to ship.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.880]   I literally canceled it last week,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.680]   because we had a review on our hands on tech show.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.840]   Jason Howell reviewed it, he's a founder.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.640]   We also had a copy here, Anthony Nielsen,
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.600]   let me play with it.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.720]   It was actually pretty good.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.160]   I just decided, here's the,
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.840]   there are a couple of problems,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.520]   and actually I'll let Mike address one of them,
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:52.080]   but one problem is you pay right now anyway,
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.640]   $130 to get the Chrome Ultra, Comcast Ultra,
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.320]   and the joystick controller, and then $10 a month
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.360]   for a subscription, but you don't, you get Destiny 2,
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   you get a free game, but everything else you have to pay for,
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.640]   and it's the same price as if I bought it for my Xbox,
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.960]   or I bought it on Steam at $60,
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.720]   you don't hold the game, they hold it,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.960]   it's on their servers, running on their servers.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.000]   So that was to me, problem number one,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.720]   and it was a problem to me because of what I want you to address,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.600]   which is Google's not known, A, for gaming,
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.680]   and they're not known for stamina.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.080]   Right, they're not known for not canceling things.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.040]   Double negative there.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.400]   However, and that's true,
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.720]   and I think they're gonna have a hard time getting people to buy in,
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.400]   because people, both gamers and the game makers,
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:46.560]   want a platform in the gaming space that's gonna be around for at least 10, 15, 20 years.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.800]   Yeah, consoles typically are 10 years less than a game.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.760]   You invest yourself in a game to really master it, and so on,
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.880]   so people get really like, look at Paul Therat with a,
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.960]   he's played Call of Duty for decades.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:57.760]   I mean imagine.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.400]   I'm not surprised Paul plays Call of Duty, that makes perfect sense.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   He plays other games occasionally, but nothing's ever as good as Call of Duty.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.200]   But you're right, it's a franchise, and they release every year,
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   a new Call of Duty, it's a, it's a, it's a, anuity for that company.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.960]   It's part of the gamer's identity, what game they're really into.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.840]   So, so it's a problem, they're reputation for killing things is a real problem,
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.800]   but here's the thing that makes, gives me pause when I want to criticize this,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:28.320]   which is that for many years, I was completely, since back when Oracle was talking about the
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.600]   Net PC, remember that?
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.200]   They were gonna have this cloud based everything, and you're gonna have this thin client where you
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.880]   can, and I was just the most anti Net PC, anti cloud device person ever.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.480]   At that time, it felt like a step backward, because that's where we'd come from,
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.680]   was the old client, you know, a VT 100 terminal, or a teletype connected to a
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:53.600]   time shared computer across town. And when we got personal computers in the 70s,
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.880]   it was like, I have my own CPU, so this is incredible.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.480]   But, but the point, but my point is that in the last two years,
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.920]   it became a rabid Chromebook fan, because I have the Pixelbook,
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.400]   it's the fastest way to use the internet.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.480]   Now you see the cloud is now okay.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.280]   Exactly.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.800]   So, so two questions.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.000]   One, is this a play for countries that have better internet than the US?
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.280]   It was in other words, all of them.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:19.760]   In other words, all of them.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:19.760]   In other words, all of them.

[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   In other words, all of them.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.760]   In other words, all of them.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   In other words, all of them.

[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:33.120]   In other words, all of them.
