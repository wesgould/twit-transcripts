[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.040]   A hundred and eight of them?

[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.040]   He's going to adjust your microphone.

[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.840]   >> In the whole baseball--
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.840]   >> Calistificos.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.840]   >> Yeah.

[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.440]   >> There's a hundred eight stitches in a baseball.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.440]   >> Absolutely.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.200]   >> And 108 beads in a rosary.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.480]   >> Coincidence, I think.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.440]   >> And that's when I decided to give Calistificos a chance,

[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.160]   Molly will be--
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   >> Yeah, hancheau.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.160]   >> Molly can now be me up.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   >> She'll beat us both up.

[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.880]   >> We'll let him announce this, but something new and exciting.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.320]   Are you going to announce it on the show today?
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   >> Well, there's not much to announce yet.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.160]   We have a couple of weeks.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.760]   >> OK, so we'll just kind of veiled illusions.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.680]   We'll just be contaminating those.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.600]   >> What's up with that?
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.720]   >> Well, speaking of veiled illusions, Mr. Patrick Norton,
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.600]   so you told the world you on the last ELTV
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.480]   that you were leaving?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.040]   >> Well, a couple episodes now.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.200]   >> Yeah, I guess it's been more since then.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.720]   I don't know.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.880]   I haven't watched again.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.320]   >> Oh.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.960]   >> I'm so sorry and sad.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.920]   >> Nice tone in that voice.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.000]   >> For Robert Heron and Pat and Roger Chang
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.800]   have to go all alone without Pat.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.720]   >> They will carry it mightily upon their shoulders.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.120]   >> And you also announced that you're with Child.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.800]   >> Yes.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.280]   >> Which is great.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.920]   Congratulations to us.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.800]   >> I thought it was this way.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.280]   >> It is his way.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.960]   >> Well, she is with Child.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.280]   We as a householder with Child.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.680]   >> They'll be with Child soon enough.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.640]   She's too soon.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.200]   >> Yes.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.680]   >> Middle October.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   >> And I forgot, do you know if it's a boy or girl
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.280]   or do you care?
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.520]   >> We're doing an old school.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.480]   We're keeping it completely apart.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.760]   >> You'll check when it arrives.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.400]   >> We're just looking for a clean bill of parts.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.320]   >> That's right.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.400]   Just a good app car scores all I ask.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> Wack.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.560]   >> It all begins with the app car score
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.400]   and then for the rest of your life,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.720]   it's test scores all the way.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   >> Actually, we're thinking about getting them
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.800]   in the union training program for painting in San Francisco.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.440]   >> Good money.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.160]   >> It'd be amazing money.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.240]   >> Did you just have your apartment painted?
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.200]   Is that why you're thinking that?
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.560]   >> No, I just was looking at career
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   options and thinking, you know, if I just become a union
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.920]   like Trisha and I do so much more money.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.480]   >> I'd be retired in like five years.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.600]   >> It's a good point.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.920]   It's sad for those of us who labor in the ink stained fields.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.720]   >> Well, it's also just, you know, one of the running jokes
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.360]   and I know you've had this feeling when you've looked around
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.440]   and I, Tom, you've had this feeling too
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.880]   where you look around and go, so when do the little thing
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.640]   in our palm turn, silver and everybody in like television
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.160]   and prints and audio, like radio explodes, you know?
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.800]   I mean, because there's like nobody over the age of 50
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.040]   and there's like 350 year olds.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.480]   >> I just heard that the Chronicle is laying off
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.240]   more than a quarter of its staff, over 100 staffers.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.000]   Bad time to be in print media.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.040]   >> Bad time to be in print media,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.080]   it's been rough actually across magazines and newspapers.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.880]   >> Now I'm hoping for a return to patronage
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.200]   where you can just have, you know, a very rich person
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.240]   just pay you to write stuff for the rest of your office
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.600]   and she's in a cued them.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.520]   >> We tried that at Tech TV, it was awkward.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.720]   >> Yeah, we did have a patron.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.560]   >> Really well.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.000]   >> That's a very good point.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.200]   Paul Allen was our, was our Medici.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.160]   >> Wow, I didn't even think of that.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.560]   >> Well, if we'd done it more directly
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.120]   to satisfy the Paul Allen needs,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.360]   I think it might have been more successful.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.200]   >> I think you're exactly right.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.680]   I think maybe one of the flaws of Tech TV
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.400]   was it didn't serve the patron.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.600]   >> Yeah, probably unless the billionaire tells you
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.160]   what the billionaire wants, well,
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.480]   we'll, we'll, umpti billionaire.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.400]   >> Right.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.320]   >> It's hard to serve the billionaire market
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.160]   'cause what-- >> He did.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.440]   He wanted eight hours of live news programming
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.280]   in a Mac show.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.840]   >> And he changed his mind then right after that.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.520]   >> He said, no, I don't think so.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.840]   I made a mistake.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.120]   So Patrick, I would be remiss if I didn't say
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.080]   where are you going, are you gonna get another job?
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.920]   Are you gonna stay at home?
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.760]   What are you planning?
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.560]   Everybody's saying, you know, he's going to revision three,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.800]   but I keep telling him that was the valley wag.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.040]   There's no confirmation of that.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.480]   >> There's, there's no confirmation of that.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.640]   I'll actually be able to talk about it.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.960]   I think next week.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.480]   >> So look for an announcement next week.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.720]   >> That un-east me twist.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.920]   >> Yeah, un-east me, yeah.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.680]   I've promised East Meast West an exclusive.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.000]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.800]   >> No, no, no, wait a minute.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.720]   That's not right.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.200]   >> No, no, no, I've just been working very hard
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.280]   to promote East Meast West.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.440]   The fabulous podcast done by Roger Chang and Tom Merritt.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.200]   It primarily covers international relations and,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.320]   and who's East Meast West.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.440]   >> Doesn't primarily, particularly.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.800]   >> Primarily doesn't do nothing.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.720]   Well, I'm really glad to have you all on board.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.760]   John C. de Vorex says he can't be here today
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.520]   because he's in the North country.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.360]   Which sounds like--
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.200]   >> It sounds like a--
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.560]   >> No, it sounds like a Bob Dillingtune.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.360]   >> He's a sad-eyed man of the North country.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.000]   But there are lots of things to talk about.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.080]   I hardly know where to start.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.960]   I guess we should start with Defcon
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.760]   because that's where you were last week, Patrick Norton.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.400]   Did you go to Black Hat 2 or just Defcon?
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.600]   >> Just Defcon.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.440]   Basically got into Defcon on Friday.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.920]   And it's-- I mean, for those of you who don't know,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.000]   Defcon is sort of the rowdy little brother of Black Hat.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.880]   Black Hat's one of the more famous security conferences
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.280]   for people who research security flaws
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.960]   or try to protect their networks
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   or pretty much anything.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.480]   >> But then they hang around.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.520]   >> You get a lot of the same presentations.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.560]   For a hundred bucks, you get a lot of the same presentations
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.400]   that cost you a few thousand bucks at Black Hat.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.880]   You just have to deal with larger crowds, less seating.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.480]   >> And Dateline NBC Dateline reporters.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.800]   >> Oh, that was absolutely brilliant.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.000]   What was-- >> Did you see it?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.600]   >> No, actually, I was actually on the phone
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.920]   with somebody when it happened.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.080]   What was really funny is the Dateline Report.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.000]   >> We all saw it on YouTube.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.400]   I should say there was a good video of it.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   >> Well, there's the good--
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   One of the videos on YouTube has my friend Grant
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.440]   from the Nerds List.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.280]   And there's sort of the Nerds List
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.280]   is this listserv of a bunch of people who are kind of geeky.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.040]   And we basically have gotten almost everybody together
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.960]   at Defcon.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.080]   And we do a dinner on Friday night.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.160]   We talk about the sessions.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.520]   And actually get to see these.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.120]   Because we-- the listserv on a good day is like two emails.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.160]   On a bad day is like 200 emails if the arguments kind
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.280]   of get frothin'.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.600]   And so Grant turns out to be friends
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.880]   with this Dateline report.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.720]   >> He knows her.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.040]   >> He knows her, all right.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.800]   And is walking into the building
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.200]   as she is sprinting out of the building.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.040]   >> Yeah, I kind of felt bad after watching that video.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.640]   I felt like she was really being almost harassed.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   >> Well, here's the thing, right?
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.720]   >> We should just explain the story is that--
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.560]   >> Sorry.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.720]   >> She was an associate producer of Dateline NBC.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.920]   Doing the traditional Dateline--
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   >> Probably still is.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.160]   >> Yeah, probably is.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.960]   Doing the traditional Dateline NBC Secret Cam thing,
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.160]   the pinhole cam, the-- to catch a hacker,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   to catch a predator.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   >> Yeah, well, here's--
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.520]   >> She had refused press credentials
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.800]   and snuck in essentially.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.960]   >> Well, yeah, here's the thing.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.360]   I don't want to take sympathy away
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.440]   from an intrepid reporter, but here's the deal is they basically
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.360]   pitched that they were going to--
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.520]   they basically pitched-- her-- there's layers
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   to this story of--
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.080]   >> You know more than others, I think.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.480]   >> Well, I've, you know, people get intoxicated.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.600]   I'm sober, I remember what they say.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.280]   But let's just put it this way.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.720]   She was offered press credentials several times,
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.080]   at least twice is my understanding before DEF CON.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.200]   And she was offered press credentials a couple times
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.160]   at DEF CON.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.320]   Now, this is important because DEF CON is a gathering
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.520]   of not just, you know, hackers, but also security researchers
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.640]   and also a lot of people who work in federal government.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.880]   And a lot of these people do not like to be photographed,
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.920]   period.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.640]   And part of the reason-- part of the deal
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.600]   with being pressed at DEF CON is the only way you're supposed
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   to, you know, you're-- the terms of entrance is that
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.000]   if you're pressed, you wear a press badge
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.040]   and you get permission before you photograph anybody
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   or videotape.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.880]   >> Perfectly reasonable.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.400]   >> Yeah, it's really simple.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.240]   And, you know--
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240]   >> And she didn't want to do that.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.560]   She wanted to catch hackers on tape saying,
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.760]   and then we're going to take over now.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.520]   It's much more obnoxious than that.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.920]   She wanted to catch a hacker doing something illegal
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.880]   in front of a Fed to show how federal--
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.760]   >> Oh, how that collision was happening.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.200]   >> Oh, God.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.160]   >> Yeah, because, you know, and there's, you know,
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.240]   there's been some really good writing on this,
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.960]   but essentially she wanted to expose federal agents
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.520]   letting illegal things happen at DEF CON.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.480]   And so she's, you know, it's like--
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.400]   it's classic, sleazy, let's grab attention headline reporting.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   >> That's how Dateline works.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.880]   What makes me sad is it's also how just in general
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.160]   technology coverage on the networks is.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.760]   It's all about sensationalism and not about--
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.320]   >> Is your computer going to die?
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.520]   >> And I thought as they followed her out to the parking lot
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   that they definitely walked the line,
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.840]   but people didn't try to obstruct her.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.160]   They didn't touch her.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.400]   They merely tumbled her.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.840]   >> They were verbally abusive.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.120]   >> And mostly what they were saying was,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.800]   we just want to ask you some questions.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.120]   We just want to ask you some questions,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.240]   which is exactly what the Dateline reporters do
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.560]   when they're hounding somebody.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.920]   So yeah, it probably was verbally abusive,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.360]   but there's certainly some irony there
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.600]   of somebody who makes their living running after people
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.640]   getting run after.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.080]   >> Well, the funny part was also is it's been interesting.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.000]   There's been more and more--
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.720]   there's a classic DEF CON game, which is called Spot the Fed.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.080]   And the idea is you look for some--
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.520]   and there's a lot of feds that go to DEF CON from--
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.000]   >> And they know that this is going to happen.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.200]   >> Yeah, and they're invited.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.480]   Matter of fact, they do a panel that's like meet the Fed.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.480]   And some pretty high level people come out
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.720]   and they spend a lot of time talking to people
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.440]   during their panels and then after their panels.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.040]   It's pretty cool to see this interaction
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.440]   between sort of the hacker community,
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.600]   the security researchers and the people who are sort of
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.040]   enforcing the law for the FBI, the DOJ,
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.040]   and so the opening of the Meet the Fed panel,
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   which is unfortunate, I was like dealing with the deadline,
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   and I would have loved to have seen the guy that runs
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.480]   the conference standing up there and going,
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.040]   instead of doing Spot the Fed, we're going to do
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   several little interesting, it's Spot the Embedded Reporter.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.040]   >> That's what he said, yeah.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   >> At which point the Embedded Reporter stood up
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.040]   and sprinted out of the--
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   >> She knew what was coming.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   >> They didn't even get to show her picture.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   That was the next thing they were going to do.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   >> And it's funny, you can get into the whole, like,
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.040]   well, you know, it's against the First Amendment
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   to restrict people, yeah, I know, but it's like--
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   >> That's a private meeting, and I think that
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.040]   there were ground rules and she didn't follow
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   the ground rules, I thought.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   >> Yeah, and they offered her, they said,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.040]   if you'd like to register, you can stay.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.040]   They said that they didn't even--
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   >> They didn't even see her out.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.040]   >> Yeah, they said, come get your press credentials.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.040]   >> She just wanted to-- she had this agenda,
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   and I shouldn't even say she.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.040]   Date line had this agenda.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.040]   >> Date line had the agenda.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   >> Let's blame Date line, because I don't think
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   it's necessarily her fault.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.040]   >> Unless she pitched the story in the--
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.040]   >> I mean, we don't know who pitched the story.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.040]   >> Either way, do yourself a favor if you're going
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.040]   to Def Con as a reporter, be opening up front about it.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   >> You don't think there'll be repercussions for her,
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   you don't think they'll hack her and try to mess
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   with her and all this?
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.040]   >> Well, it's not.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   >> She took her Facebook page down, I know that much.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.040]   >> Did she?
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.040]   >> Smart move.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   >> Yeah, but it's an interesting thought, right?
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.040]   I don't think anybody-- I don't-- yeah, I don't know.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.040]   >> There are enough childish people at--
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   I shouldn't say this.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.040]   >> There's enough childish people in the universe.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.040]   >> In the universe that somebody could decide,
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   hey, I'm going to make an example of this girl,
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   and certainly-- or this woman, and certainly--
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   >> Or Twit.tv for me.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   >> Or me, and that's why I shouldn't be saying this.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   Anything else interesting at Def Con, do you see any
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.040]   presentations you thought were compelling or?
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.040]   >> Nothing that's not going to make me sound like I'm
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   waving the fear, uncertainty, and doubt flag.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.040]   Couple of embarrassing presentations, Visiviz using,
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   basically exploiting some holes in the way browsers work
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   to allow you access to secured networks.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   And I'm not going to even get into that, because I'll screw up
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   explaining it.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   >> Crash to the passport RFID readers, do I understand?
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.040]   >> That was a magnificent presentation, because what the
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:44.040]   guy's done, he's basically-- I wish I could think of his name,
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.040]   and it was an amazing presentation, because he basically
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   built a bespoke box that if he hooks it into a card reader,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   basically unscrew the-- you know, he's like, are you being
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   protected by a piece of plastic and two screws,
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   was kind of the theme.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.040]   And he basically did the underlying technology of all
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.040]   the existing pass card readers, and which ones were
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.040]   grossly useless and sort of going up through the level of
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.040]   security.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   But he goes up to one of the more secure kind of passes,
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   which it's not an RFID tag, but it's a similar piece of
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   technology.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   But what was interesting is he basically built a piece of
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   electronics that patches into the line, and then he can program
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   that little IC and PCB board to allow to either clone somebody's
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.040]   pass, or to clone the last pass that comes through,
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.040]   or to deny anyone access to that room, or-- and then he sort of
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   has stages of developments of this, and like stage four will be
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   with a GSM module, so he'll be able to track who's going in and
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   out of a building anywhere in the world.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   Very tough crews, I like it.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.040]   Well, it's really interesting, and it's-- physical security has
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.040]   been something that's been-- something people have seriously
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.040]   been looking at in the past few years, the bump-- the--
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.040]   The bump keys, yeah.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.040]   Bump keys, and just lock picking before that, and
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   understanding that physical security, it's much easier to hack a
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.040]   network if you are inside the building.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.040]   The field there, yeah.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   And a lot of physical security is kind of like, you know, you're
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.040]   being protected by a lock that says secure.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   Well, those MedCo locks, I thought that was very interesting.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   They made a bump key for the MedCo.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   Supposedly--
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.040]   Yeah, MedCos are pretty badass.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.040]   Generally, the scary lock picking people usually say
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.040]   things, MedCos.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040]   We'll stay away from those.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   MySpace, kind of little slap to a security researcher, this closed
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   security vulnerabilities in the MySpace site, so they yanked his
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   profile.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   He was speaking at DEF CON Rick Deacon.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   I don't know if you saw it.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.040]   It was a cross-site scripting attack that uses JavaScript, i
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   frames, and a separate web server.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.040]   It's a pretty nasty hack.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   All you have to do is get the MySpace user to click a bogus link
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.040]   and you can copy their session cookies and their log data, or
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   actually modify their MySpace session cookies and log data.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   MySpace apparently knew about the talking.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.040]   Sent a Terms of Service violation notice to him and kicked him
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   off MySpace.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.040]   But they also fixed it.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   Did they fix it?
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.040]   That's the main thing.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   I think I read so well that they actually took his research
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   and then fixed it.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   I would hope so.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.040]   Yeah, apparently MySpace-- this is according to T.G.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.040]   Daily-- MySpace apparently fixed the vulnerability a
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.040]   short time later, and Deacon's attack now redirects to a Google page.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.040]   I guess, in a way, when you do that kind of thing, you are
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.040]   violating the Terms of Service.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.040]   Right?
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.040]   I mean, if-- I mean, that is a violation.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.040]   But if you're doing it publicly and telling people about it,
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.040]   you're doing them a favor.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   Did you see the Facebook source code leak?
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.040]   There's apparently a PHP, some sort of flaw in PHP, and the
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.040]   source code for Facebook's main index page is leaked.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.040]   It's been posted on a blog called-- it's really a one-time only
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.040]   blog, an anonymous blog called Facebook Secrets.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.040]   And the thinking is that it was-- it's a well-known whole in
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   PHP, but this is out there, and almost everybody agrees.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   It's the real deal.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.040]   Just putting it out into the GPL.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   Of course it's--
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   Say how we meant to do it.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.040]   I mean, it's not like Facebook source code.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.040]   It's got magnificent industry secrets.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   Like, you know, they're fantastically efficient friend-adding
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   technology or something.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   Right.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   Well, and that's what they say.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   They say it was a misconfigured server.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   It was our source code.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   It's not a security breach.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   It doesn't compromise user data in any way.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   And however, the reprinting of the code violates laws, and we
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   ask that you don't repeat it.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   So it's useless, but please don't hand it out.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   Sorry, this just has me all excited about SCO finding it
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   and getting slapped to the ground and kicking it to the--
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.040]   Yeah, it's over.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.040]   Our long national nightmare.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   Well, it's almost over.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.040]   SCO SUSE in 2003, SUSE IBM, and ultimately no fail over SCO
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   for lack of any viable business model decides to sue.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.040]   It was larger than stock computing.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   It was real good for their stock for a while, but it dragged on
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040]   and on.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   The stock came back down and now a judge this week says that
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:55.040]   the trademark Linux--or Unix and the rights to Unix are
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   legally officially part of novell.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.040]   They've got it legitimately.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   SCO has no rights to this.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   And the good news is I think that that means the IBM case,
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.040]   which is still hanging out, which is supposed to be decided
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   at the end of the month.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.040]   It'll probably go the same way.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.040]   I mean, it's hard to imagine it going a different way after this.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.040]   So it's over.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   We've been talking about it since day one on Twit.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.040]   So I'm glad we can finally close the book on this one.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.040]   So it's in the pre-date?
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   Yeah, pre-date's Twit by a couple of years.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.040]   The IBM case does, I think, right?
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.040]   Let's go.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.040]   Sue, IBM in 2003, yeah.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.040]   So pre-date's us considerably.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.040]   I remember you talking about it back then.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   On tech TV, we probably talked about it.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   So anyway, it's over.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.040]   Thank goodness.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   Even Mowglen, who I really like, even, we interviewed him for
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   "Lost Weekly."
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.040]   He's the guy who did GPL3.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   He's at the Software Freedom Law Center.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   He said it was argued that this was supposed to suggest riskiness
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   and open source.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   It turns out the open source world was rock solid from the beginning.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.040]   So a big victory for open source.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   Maybe a Sko can go partner with Perfect 10 now.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   They're going-- they're with Perfect 10, Sue's Microsoft.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.040]   They lost against Google the thumbnail image issue.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   They're a porno site.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   Google was in there--
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   Microsoft have like bigger thumbnails or something.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   Well, there's an argument about that.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   We're going to talk about the guy who has always thumbnails a little bit.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   It's called the biggest.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.040]   Is it Microsoft or Google?
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   According to Perfect 10, they sued Google.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   They sued Amazon.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   They're appealing the decision.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   They claim the MSN search engine can find passwords that have been
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   improperly posted on other websites in Enable Access.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   So now it's not thumbnails.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   It's illegally posted passwords to Perfect 10.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   Hey, it's just--
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.040]   Where page is there, isn't it?
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   It's like Microsoft finds information posted for the internet.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.040]   Well, it's awesome.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   But having it--
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.040]   It's quite a shocker because that Microsoft search engine can find anything
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.040]   is pretty impressive.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   And I thought--
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   But you want to go ahead and see Google for the same thing.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   I don't know.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:56.040]   It seems like-- you know, isn't the code to be able to detect multiple logins
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   from different IPs across the same password?
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   Pretty rock solid at this point.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   Couldn't they just kick these people out?
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   They could have figured--
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.040]   They claim they're losing $4 million a month.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   That's pretty bogus.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.040]   And if they win this case, of course, search engines go out of business
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   because what are you going to say?
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   Well, we got to see what we're indexing.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   Is that a password?
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   Better not.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.040]   I just have a feeling they thought Microsoft probably didn't have it
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.040]   as together as Google, which is silly.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.040]   Right.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.040]   Of course, Microsoft has a very good team of lawyers.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.040]   Why you go after them next?
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   I don't understand.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   There's plenty of smaller search engines they could have gone after.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   It's probably just pure publicity, right?
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.040]   It's that short guy at the bar that goes from fight to fight to fight.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.040]   Right.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   Who's the next biggest bully?
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.040]   I'll tell you, who does have smaller thumbnails?
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.040]   The North Denver fella-- I know.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.040]   This does not ring true to me.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   Thomas Martell, he's actually in Bonnie Break, Colorado,
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   had his thumb surgically altered to work better on his iPhone.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.040]   It seems to be a legit story.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   It's certainly being reported everywhere.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   Whittling.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   His thumbs were whittled down.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.040]   He said he's a heavy PDA user, and he's always been frustrated that his
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   thumbs were too big to properly operate PDA keyboards.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   I know, this doesn't seem like this should even be legal.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:15.040]   The procedure is both making a small incision into the thumbs and shaving down the bone.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   That's got to hurt.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   That has got to hurt.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.040]   He says he has no problem lifting anything.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.040]   He just has a surprise by the fact that he can't open spaghetti jars.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   The spaghetti sauce jars as well as a used to.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   I wish we had pictures.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   I'm glad we don't, actually.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.040]   Apparently his thumbs now are out of proportion of the rest of his hand.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.040]   I have this vision of six foot eight contractor dude who can pick up a little
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   bird's phone.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   Yeah, with a little tiny thumbs.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   You've got girl thumbs.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   Oh my god.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   Back to security, the Open BSD team mocked at the first ever--
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   Now do we have to pronounce this Poney Awards?
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.040]   Yes.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.040]   Were you at the Ponies?
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   Were you at the Ponies?
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   I often get emails criticizing me for saying pwned instead of it pwned.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.040]   Instead of owned?
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.040]   It's owned your box.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.040]   You could say owned, but then--
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.040]   No, that's what you're saying, but there's a P there and it's much more fun to say pwn.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   Plus it makes you feel like you're an LOL cat.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   Exactly.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   I can has whatever I want.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   I can has pwnes.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   I has your power supplies.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   What is it with the LOL cats?
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.040]   It just makes me so--
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.040]   We should put a link to the LOL cats.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   Thank you.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.040]   You like them, Will Harris?
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   Oh, come on, everybody likes girl cats.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   Your girlfriend likes them.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   This is just a way for you to continue to have sex, isn't it?
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.040]   Admit it.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   Yeah, listen to my laugh.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040]   He's guilty.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.040]   Some cat.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   I know that there are people who like LOL cats.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.040]   It's beyond me what the cuteness is.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   But I love the LOL cats.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   You love them too.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   I also wear a skirt on national television.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   So apparently my masculinity is suspect.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   No, it's not.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   It's not.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   Very comfortable with it.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.040]   Anyhow, I can has a cheeseburger.com.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   C-H-E-E-Z burger.com.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   Oh, let's not spread this meme.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   It's already spread.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   Yeah, it's already spread.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.040]   The cats out of the bag.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   Apparently intelligent people like Veronica are doing this.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   And now I hear that Patrick and Will--
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.040]   Yeah, it's bad enough of them.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.040]   You've never made one, though, have you?
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   It's bad as the delete expletives.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   The dumb delete expletives are doing it.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.040]   But Veronica Belmont, a sensible intelligent human being.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   Clearly, I'm missing something.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   It's sort of a twisted like hang in there.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   You know that old poster?
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   Yeah, hang in there.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   Yeah, it's just sort of a twisted version of that.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   How long before we had poker playing dogs saying cute slogans?
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   You just don't do it for me.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.040]   You just don't do it for me.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   You just don't do it for me.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   Check your boards, Leo.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   They're showing up now.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   You're a pretty show right now.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040]   What are they doing, Britt?
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.040]   What are they doing, Britt?
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.040]   Is it different?
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   Is there cultural?
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.040]   Is there at least somewhere preserving somehow this great Anglo-Saxon culture of ours?
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.040]   Come on, how can you not laugh at that?
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040]   Okay, my ears.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.040]   It's much anybody else.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   Big chord.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   Back-ordered.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   Back-ordered.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.040]   My ears, back-ordered.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   Oh, he doesn't have any ears.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   He doesn't have any ears.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   He's a little shitty in a box without any ears.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   My ears, back-ordered.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.040]   [laughter]
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   Who was it, wrote an entire linguistic analysis of the--
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.040]   Oh, yeah, I remember seeing that too.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   Somebody intelligent.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   Like a grammar of all cats.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   A grammar.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   LOL cats grammar.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   Yeah, he even told you how you could-- how you should be writing these from now on.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040]   So if you--
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   Oh, Neil Dash, that's right, of "Six Apart."
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   Oh, Pat is looking at all cats and laughing!
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040]   Okay, you're looking--
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   I mean, you're not iron-furbing you.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   Cat with really big eyes saying-- what does he say?
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   No, the red bull, thanks.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   Oh, jeez.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   Neil Dash, I has idiosyncratic conjugation.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   [laughter]
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   Now, you know there's a controversy on what to call them to.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   There are some people I know, Ryan Block from Engadget for a while, much prefers to not call them "lawl cats."
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.040]   He calls them something, "Oh, kitten something."
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.040]   "Kitten captions?"
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   "Kitten captions?"
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.040]   "Kitten captions."
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   He's just going for the alliteration, obviously.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.040]   No, it's not that.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   It's some sort of alternate name for them.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.040]   Well, you know, it does actually predate the cats.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.040]   It's this image macro capability, right?
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.040]   Oh, kitten macros.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.040]   Cat macros, that's what it goes.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   Well, I guess technically what they are.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.040]   Well, I guess it's-- but you know, you're always going to be annoyed with some memes that come around the internet.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.040]   These amuse me, at least.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   Hey, if you keep doing this, I'm going to start singing "Chocolate Rain."
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   I got to warn you.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.040]   Chocolate?
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.040]   Oh, man.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.040]   You don't know about that?
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.040]   Apparently not.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   We're going to leave that alone, because otherwise we'll have no more listeners.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.040]   Obviously, Tom knows what I'm talking about.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   How about you have an actually-- I've refrained from going and watching it.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.040]   I've heard enough people imitate it.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.040]   That's enough for me.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.040]   You have to-- I don't want to get into it.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   For more on "Chocolate Rain," check your local library.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.040]   Check your local library.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:10.040]   Go to Mac Break Weekly 51, I believe we spent many, many minutes playing the song, dissecting the song.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   Anyway, back to the ponies.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.040]   There are little gold ponies, by the way.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   Can you bet on the ponies?
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:32.040]   No, it's a P.O.-- which, by the way, would-- if they really are, if this is just something that the ZVNet blogs put in there to give it a graphic touch, but there's a little gold pony.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   If it is, the, in fact, have a little gold pony award.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.040]   I think we conclusively proven it should be pronounced pony.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   There you go.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:44.040]   The OpenBSD team won the award for the most spectacular mishandling of a critical security vulnerability.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:52.040]   Instead of acknowledging it as a problem, they-- and fixing it, they just downgraded it.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.040]   That's a good way to handle it.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   It just goes to show the open source doesn't even mean-- doesn't always mean clever.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   Have you been watching this Mike Shaver, little no mozilla frickha?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.040]   I think this was also at--
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.040]   You know, I heard about it, but it went right over my head.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   So, I mean, I don't know if it's really a big deal, but somebody-- Mike Shaver, who is, you know, kind of one of the product guys at the mozilla.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.040]   Nice guy.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.040]   We've interviewed many times on that at night.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.040]   Right.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:32.040]   Handed his card to some security guy who apparently had been releasing mozilla flaws, and with a little bravado, I think, implying that, you know, the thing-- the good thing about mozilla is any flaw, we will fix it.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.040]   We'll fix it quickly.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.040]   We'll fix it right away.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.040]   We'll patch flaws in 10 days.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   He wrote it in a little more aggressive way.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.040]   He gave him his card and said, "10 effing days on the card."
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.040]   And I think that-- so this has gone on.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   It's been blogged, and now the mozilla people are saying, "Well, you know, we don't want to make a light of security flaws, and we can't guarantee 10 days. We're not making a promise here. We'll do them as fast as we can."
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   But 10 days, you can't always say 10 days.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.040]   And there's a-- they released a nice quote on it.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.040]   I think it's fine.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   It doesn't fuck me.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   I just-- one more little security issue.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   "Best server side bugs, Solaris.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   Best client side bug.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.040]   A windows of vulnerability.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   The Pony for Mass Onage, one by the unknown hacker who found the W.M.F.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   flaw, which was massively, massively used.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   They estimate a million people got hacked on my space by that one.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:31.040]   The vulnerability deserves an award for its obviousness, ease of exploitation, and high impact.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   It's-- I like these awards.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   This must have been a fun event.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.040]   I'm sorry you missed this.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   It's like style as well.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   Style.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.040]   "Best Easter egg in a vulnerability."
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.040]   Most over hyped bug, I agree with this, the MacBook Y5 vulnerability.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.040]   From last year's Black Hat.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.040]   Although--
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.040]   Did they have--
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.040]   They did patch it.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.040]   Did they have a most anticipated hack?
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   iPhone unlocking.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.040]   Oh, yeah, that's just a matter of time.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   Sure it is.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.040]   You think?
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.040]   You think not?
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.040]   I don't know.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.040]   It's RSA.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.040]   It's pretty strong.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.040]   It'll be a while.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   Oh, somebody can unlock it.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   I thought somebody had gotten close to unlocking it already.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040]   There's all sorts of hacks.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.040]   I just-- somebody's doing an NES emulator on the iPhone.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   They're able to put applications on there.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.040]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.040]   Yeah, that one is really fun because you get the controller actually up on the screen.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   On the screen, you'll get NES controller shows up as a touchscreen.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   Not that that's ergonomic or anything, but certainly cool.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   There are apparently in iTunes or maybe on the iPhone--
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.040]   I guess it's on the iPhone strings about games.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   Right.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   It can only be a matter of time.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   I mean, why wouldn't Apple?
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   There are already some games on the video.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.040]   Yeah, but the fastest way to make sure the iPhone gets completely unlocked in the next seven days
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:44.040]   is for me to say something like, you know, I can stand outside a federal bank and it's just like I almost broke in.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   Okay, say it, say it.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   We want you to say it.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   I want him to crack it.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   There you go.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   You can still do the seven days.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.040]   It'll be broken.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:29:00.040]   With SIM cards, you can like close two different SIM cards into one special silver SIM card and then you can sort of get service.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.040]   Will is watching this with great interest.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.040]   Wait, you've got the right direction on a windy day.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   Well, the fact that somebody came up with the installer.app to make it easier to install all these different tweaks and hacks.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   People are coming out for the iPhone OS.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:16.040]   You think Apple will be watching this and saying, "Gosh, I guess they want third party applications."
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   Well, the iPhone DevWick, you guys.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   I think they're working on unlocking it, too.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   Yes.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   I'm sure they are.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   I'm sure they are.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   Speaking of unlocking.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   Yes.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.040]   Universal music.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.040]   Do we care?
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.040]   Huge.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.040]   First of all, EMI, of course, the first to do it.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:37.040]   They did it on iTunes and if you look at sales while CD sales still going down, their online sales went up.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   In some cases, by several hundred percent on my dark side of the moon in the first couple of days, they tripled their album sales.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   The only reason I didn't buy dark side of the moon is I owned it on vinyl and it's the one thing that it's motivating me to go and digitize all my albums one of these days.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.040]   I own it on vinyl.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   I own it on CD and I still bought the 256 kilobits.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.040]   I'm happy to protect it on iTunes.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.040]   I'm proud to say I own it in none of these formats, but now I know where to go next time.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.040]   You can borrow mine.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.040]   Next time you own a wizard of Oz.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   Somebody sent me, when we worked at Tech TV, somebody sent me a DVD with dark side of the moon and Wizard of Oz perfectly matched.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   I'll find that.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.040]   It's somewhere in this shelving here.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   If you'd like to take it home with you, Patrick.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   I'm good for the moment.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040]   Thank you.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   Find parting gift.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   Me and my pregnant wife watching dark side of the moon sinker.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   The interesting thing about the universal thing is that they are not going to sell on DRM music through Apple, through iTunes.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.040]   Well, yes, and I think that's a little slap at Apple.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.040]   Remember, Universal's the one that said we're going month to month with Apple.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:47.040]   Where it's really interesting is on Rhapsody because Rhapsody's going to sell, you know, I use an iPod.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   I couldn't download anything from Rhapsody in the past.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   They're going to sell unprotected universal music at 256 kilobits.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.040]   So it's going to be good quality.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.040]   I'm excited.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   It's 99 cents.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   AAC or WMB for me.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   You know, I think they use Windows Media.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   I imagine WMA.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:08.040]   But you can drag WMA into iTunes and if it's not protected, and iTunes will turn into the MP3.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   So this is universal looking at what happened for EMI, I think, and saying, "Hmm, do you think this is the beginning of the end?"
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   I mean, you know, we're starting to see the failure of DRM.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   If it works for universal, even if it's not on iTunes.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:27.040]   Well, I guess the $64,000 question is, you know, what's the revenue stream that replaces the "lost revenue"?
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.040]   That's the thing, though.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.040]   In my opinion, there isn't any lost revenue.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   The only lost revenue they have is from people not wanting to buy the songs like me because they don't want the DRM on them.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   Right.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   That's what the long crease revenue is.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   Yes, I agree with you.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:48.040]   I think the biggest DRM thing this week has to be the Google thing there, surely, where people are just losing their videos.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.040]   Pissing people off?
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.040]   I mean, that is just crazy.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.040]   How can they do that?
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.040]   So if you bought a video...
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   So if you bought a video...
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   So if you bought a video...
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.040]   How's taking back DVDs?
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   Explain this to me in the show.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   Explain this to me in the show.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   The DRM from the Google store.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.040]   Can you know what they should turn off the server?
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.040]   You can no longer play it.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   It won't authenticate.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.040]   So you can no longer watch the video that you paid for to buy.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   Oh, that can't be.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:20.040]   Yeah, because every time you watch a Google video, it authenticates with the Google server and they sent me a very nice email on Friday that said,
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.040]   "Hey, you know, August 15th, we're getting out of this business because we bought YouTube, so we're shutting it all off.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:34.040]   You won't be able to authenticate anymore, but here is a credit for Google checkout that you can use for the amount of what you paid for the movie that you thought you owned.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   So you can still give us some business that way and get the money back."
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   But you get a credit.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   So you're...
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   You get a credit.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.040]   You're giving your refund for the movie.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.040]   You're trying to do the right thing.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   But it's like, "What are you going to do?"
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   Like, if you bought a single episode of Star Trek on Google Video...
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   Which is exactly what I do.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.040]   Where are you going to go and get it?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.040]   Oh, well, you're going to go...
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   You got $5 on Google Checkout.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   Well, great.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   That's $5 towards like the $50 for Star Trek season.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.040]   Which expires.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.040]   I got $2 credit with Google Checkout.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.040]   What am I going to do with that?
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   Oh, I should be getting one of those emails.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   I bought a Call for Help episode.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.040]   So that's really annoying.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   Hard to believe.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.040]   And frankly, counterproductive in terms of DRM because it is.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:20.040]   All it's going to do is people aren't going to buy DRM stuff anymore.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   And maybe that's why Google's doing it.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   Although the problem is not that many people bought any of the Google Video stuff to begin with.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.040]   No.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.040]   We tried to sell our show on there and nobody wanted it.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   I don't know if that's DRM, Google or me.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   I bought one episode of Deep Space Nine just to check it out.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   Right.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.040]   And I was really upset that I had to be connected to the Internet to watch anything.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   But that's also how MovieLink and the other downloadable feature movie sites all started out as they would do the...
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.040]   You had to be connected to the authentication.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:57.040]   And then it was a big step when you could actually view the stuff you had purchased or rented while not being connected on the Internet.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   This is a big warning to people who are buying this kind of stuff.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   There's no guarantee that this is going to be good a year from now.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:10.040]   It seems unthinkable, but Apple could turn off your entire music collection if you bottle your stuff from iTunes.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.040]   They could do it.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   Is that true?
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.040]   Does iTunes go out and check to make sure I can play that song every time I play?
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:27.040]   Not every time you play it, but when you've authenticated it to a computer, they could go in when you're logged in sometime and they could trip it off.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040]   What's interesting thought?
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   What happens if one of these companies goes out of business?
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   Now, granted, if you burned it to a CD or something, then you're safe.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   That's the way to back it up.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   But any kind of DRM can be turned off at some point.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:48.040]   Or if you think about all the people who paid the $200 a year, two-year deal, whatever it was, it's Sunrock.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:54.040]   Sunrocket goes out of business and all this and all these people that prepaid for the VoIP system or SOL.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   Which is why I think it's going to be hard for UMA to convince people to pay 300 bucks for this hardware because right after Sunrocket goes out of business, they come along with the same model.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   Or not the same model, worse model.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   It's a very confusing model, at least.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.040]   What a great name.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.040]   And who's doing their marketing?
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.040]   Was it Gary Coleman?
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   Somebody.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.040]   It's Ashton Kutcher.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   Ashton Kutcher, Gary Coleman.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.040]   Much taller and differently come with it.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.040]   I can fuse them.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   Time Warner admits, or maybe it seems to be admits that they're going to be doing some traffic shaping.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   This is to bolster the arguments against net neutrality.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:44.040]   FCC said, "Well, and Ted Stevens, soon to be the felonious Ted Stevens, say, "Well, no, there's no problem.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   We'll wait until there's a problem to pass along."
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   Well, there's a problem now.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   Time Warner says they're going to implement traffic shaping.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   And if you're a World of Warcraft player, you may not want to be on Time Warner.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.040]   What does that traffic shaping actually mean?
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   Well, what are they doing?
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   Let me read it to you.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.040]   This is the email that Time Warner sent out.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   Time Warner today implemented a network management tool to improve the operation of the network for all subscribers.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:21.040]   As a result, a small minority of users may experience slower speeds during peak hours when using certain applications that consume lots of bandwidth.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:38.040]   Basically, every major ISP, at least at the regional level, if not the national level, is using either customized versions of Squid or specific tools, boxes such as Packetear that is doing packet shaping based on deep analysis of traffic.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.040]   Looking into the content.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   Looking deep into the content.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   Not just the port.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:54.040]   That was one of the things that the guy was talking about earlier, Kaminsky, who was looking at basically taking advantage of frames inside of a browser to penetrate networks and set up a VPN inside of somebody's network.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:03.040]   He was also talking about how frustrated he is that the ISPs are doing some pretty deep and nasty analysis of traffic he finds offensive for life.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.040]   So you think they are doing this now?
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.040]   No, I know they are doing this now.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   One of the things we ran into at DLTV, and a lot of people who are doing large amounts of bandwidth distribution, is you find customers suddenly go from folks that are watching the show, suddenly go from a megabit down load to 50 key downloads.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.040]   And it's not the end of the month, therefore they haven't hit their bandwidth tap or something like that.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:37.040]   But there are networks commonly frequently and totally use tools that monitor bandwidth across customers, across the network, across specific protocols.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:42.040]   And the folks at BitTorrent are in sort of a running, dodging battle.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   Who was like, "Oh, I've encrypted my packets.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.040]   No one will be able to tell them I'm using a peer to peer tool now."
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:53.040]   Well, no, actually, peer to peer has a very significant, or, excuse me, a very predictable traffic signature.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.040]   So if they can't merely the content, they're looking at what your patterns are.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.040]   They're looking at the patterns and how the data moves and how the connections are moving.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:13.040]   And it's very serious stuff because on one hand, yeah, I don't want the kid down the street that's exchanging 400 terabytes of movies every day of his life to screw up my ability to have a VoIP call.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:21.040]   On the flip side, I don't want to, something I'm targeted to be nowhere near the capacity of my network because they don't like video moving across their network.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   Well, that's the thing. I've been told over and over by people in the networking business that you have to shape traffic.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:33.040]   And I don't know if that's true, but they seem very insistent that everybody does it.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   You can't get around it.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   No argument.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.040]   There's just not enough bandwidth to go around.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.040]   Well, that makes sense to me.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.040]   But it's what you're shaping, right?
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.040]   Well, like who gets to decide how it gets allocated?
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   Well, and if you shape Skype because you have your own voice over internet business, that's pretty awful.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   That's just anti-competitive.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:06.040]   It could be, let's brazenly assume, and it may be a pretty brazen assumption that none of the major ISPs are targeting shaping against competitive products to what they offer.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   Maybe they're giving a little preferential treatment to their own packets, but let's just take the great furry assumption that they're not degrading performance.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.040]   You're going to be very positive.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.040]   It'll be very positive about this.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:24.040]   The flip side of that is what you just said, Tom, is they've basically been selling all of us the idea that we're paying for 5 megabits of access.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:30.040]   And the truth is, they're perfectly willing to give me 5 megabits of access for my $50 a month.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:37.040]   As long as we do it for maybe $100K, $250K, maybe a half of a 500K at a pop max.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:51.040]   And as soon as I get to the point where I want my 5 megabits per second for a 200 megabyte download, you'll understand, if you had a commercial account, which would be $900 a month, we could actually give you a sustained...
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.040]   What we promised is what you think you purchase.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:59.040]   Is it the total amount of data they're looking at or the throughput that they're looking at?
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.040]   They're looking at all of it.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.040]   Basically, they're going to be looking across individual accounts, right? They're going to be looking to target problem users.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:13.040]   And by that, they're going to be associating your IP address with the volume of data you consume.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.040]   Time Warner denies that they ever sent this email out.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   Although many World of Warcraft users in Rochester, New York and other areas are saying, "All of a sudden, we can't...
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.040]   "We're getting lagged, latency-freezing."
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   Time Warner says, "It's not us. And it's hard to prove. That's the real problem."
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.040]   Well, that's what's really... The guys that we had a chance to interview some of one of the guys from Packethere,
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.040]   and they're like, "Look, we work really hard to leave no fingerprint on the packets."
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:48.040]   The flip side is, there's always going to be something to blame.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   The other thing, one of the things I've learned in the last two years, moving so much video across the web is that,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:41:01.040]   it's really easy to... If you have anything that's... Where latency is critical or a bandwidth flow is critical,
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.040]   it's really easy to break your tubes.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   Right.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   Is there really a bandwidth crunch because that's usually the cry that they say when they're like,
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:15.040]   "Well, I know we're saying 5 megabytes, but we can't allow that to people because we just don't have enough bandwidth."
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.040]   Well, what's interesting is, think about it this way, what's the maximum capacity for a cable node,
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   right? And then remember that that a cable node is essentially operating... Let's pull a number, a random number.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   Let's call it a... Your local cable node is effectively a 10 megabit per second Ethernet system for your entire neighborhood.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.040]   Now, if your entire neighborhood is in Squeedunk in the entire town, it's 3,000 people, and you've got like six nodes,
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:45.040]   it's probably not that big a deal. If you're living like you do in Oakland or I do in San Francisco, where there may be, you know,
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:51.040]   40,000 people, you know what I mean? It's just, you know, the more people you throw on the node...
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.040]   But isn't there all this dark fiber? I mean, isn't there really a lot of time?
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.040]   Dark fiber doesn't help a lot in the last month.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.040]   Well, it's dark right now.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.040]   Well, you're saying that's one fiber.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:06.040]   Dark fiber is great. So, you know, Google can light up their backbone system, but the dark fiber doesn't mean squat
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:11.040]   when you're talking about your local DSL provider or cable provider or microwave provider,
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   where they have a fine mind about of bandwidth for the given equipment that they own.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:20.040]   And upgrading that equipment may not be something they want to do, because, you know, if you upgrade your equipment,
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.040]   you're taking away from the bottom line of profits.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:29.040]   My idyllic dream that I know is just pie in the sky is that the dark fiber gets hooked to...
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.040]   Wait a minute, we can't hear him because of your idyllic music.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.040]   Go ahead. What's your idyllic dream?
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:39.040]   That the dark fiber gets hooked up to the Y-Max.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.040]   And then that's the last mile.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   But Y-Max has the same congestion issues.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:50.040]   Yeah, the problem is Y-Max is a lot like EVDO in the sense that the more people they have sharing at the less bandwidth to go around.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:54.040]   You just need more repeaters and then it ends up being the same problem as Y-Fi.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.040]   Same issue.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.040]   What comes after Gigabit?
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   Terabit?
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   Terabit. We need petabit. We need, like, petabit, you know.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.040]   We need petabit transmission capabilities.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:06.040]   They're talking about Terabit routers. I mean, they're talking about getting this kind of capability built.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:12.040]   Well, we need, yeah, I mean, basically we all need to pony up and cut giant checks to get that internet to work in.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.040]   Yeah, baby.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:19.040]   Well, and then the other thing you hear, and I don't know if it's true, but we have a lot of listeners, for instance, in Sweden, where they also say,
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.040]   "Oh, baby, we have 100 megabits up and 100 megabits down.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.040]   It's $2 a month.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.040]   Yeah, and you've got 9 million people and almost all they're in urban areas.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   Yeah, that's really why.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.040]   You know what? Great. So, you know, let's fire a casket.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   Yeah, I'm moving in with cigarettes.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.040]   But I love them.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   I love them too.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040]   And they're even, they're happy.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.040]   And they wonder if cigarette needs a roommate.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.040]   [laughter]
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   Broadcom has won in this Qualcomm batin fight. In fact, the federal government upheld a ban by the US ITC on the importation of smartphones
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   containing the Qualcomm chips. That's because of this battery saving patent tentative award for $40 million in damages.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   The judge said, "You know, it's not...
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.040]   There's a spectrum of improper conduct," he said.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:09.040]   And Qualcomm's conduct was not at the most egregious end of the spectrum.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:19.040]   However, damages are due. And more than the damage is, it really worries me about what kinds of smartphones are going to get in the states.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:26.040]   Yeah, this is starting to look bad. I really thought there would be some sort of settlement between Broadcom and Qualcomm.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.040]   Nobody's blinking.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:33.040]   What phones have these Qualcomm chipsets in them? Anybody know? I mean, what phones are we knocking?
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.040]   I think a lot of the HTC phones will not be entering the country.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.040]   I just... It's all so confusing now.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.040]   The majority of 3G phones use the Qualcomm chips.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   Almost all of them.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   So it's essentially, and I don't think it's 100% true, but essentially, if you can't have any Qualcomm chips, then you don't have any new 3G phones.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   I'm telling you, that edge on my iPhone is looking better all the time.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   She's...
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.040]   The Wi-Fi looks fine.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.040]   Yeah, the Wi-Fi is okay.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   I'm just glad I'm not the only person on this podcast that hasn't invested in an iPhone yet.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.040]   We can arrange an iPhone for you. Let's get Patrick an iPhone.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   Will, do you have an iPhone?
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.040]   No, you don't.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.040]   He's right.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.040]   Yeah, I have one.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   He bought one.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.040]   I am the only one with an iPhone.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.040]   I love his blog post. His blog post is, "Hey, I was in New York and I got an iPhone and I also got engaged.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   But I got an iPhone!"
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   Nice priorities there, Will.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   Are you still engaged after that post?
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.040]   Was it an engagement iPhone?
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.040]   It was actually, yeah.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.040]   There you go.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   Which was awesome.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.040]   It was rocking.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.040]   Did she get an iPhone?
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.040]   No, she got the ring.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.040]   Well, I bet it was a good ring.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.040]   I bet it was a ring tone.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.040]   Ring ring tone.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.040]   Ring ring tone.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.040]   There is a new application.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.040]   I haven't tried it.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.040]   I just downloaded it.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.040]   Supposedly, it lets you put ring tones in the iPhone.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.040]   I don't know how hard that is.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.040]   It's fantastic.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.040]   I haven't tried it yet either because I'm afraid.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.040]   I'm not going to mess with this thing.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.040]   I'm not going to mess with this thing.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   Now, I have totally given up on my old iPod now and I've turned it into a rock box.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.040]   Isn't that funny?
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.040]   I wiped it off and tried to install OS 10 on it.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.040]   I'm abusing it now because I have the iPhone.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.040]   Isn't that funny?
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.040]   8Gigs isn't much, but it's enough.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.040]   That's all I've been listening to.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   All my books on tape are on the iPhone.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.040]   I guess they're not on tape.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.040]   They're on bits.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.040]   My book's on bits on the iPhone.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   Hey, speaking of which, it's time for our audible commercial.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   I'm just going to throw this in here, slip this in so nobody will notice.

[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.040]   We've got the book for you, don't we, Patrick Norton?
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:47.040]   Yes, ladies and gentlemen, today we'd like to offer you a fine chance to...
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.040]   Where's your book?
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.040]   It's the new Steven Gibson.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.040]   Here, I'll hold it up for everybody watching.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.040]   William Gibson.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.040]   Are you on the audio?
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.040]   Steve and Gibson.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   Steve and Gibson.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.040]   William Gibson's spook country.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.040]   Oh, I can't wait to read it.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:02.040]   His latest fantastic gathering of memes, even social interaction.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.040]   He's doing it old school.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.040]   He's actually reading the print.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040]   Yeah, I got my text issues.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.040]   I was in Green Apple Books and spotted it.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.040]   How is it?
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:11.040]   It's...
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.040]   If you liked pattern recognition, you'll like this.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.040]   I loved it.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   If you hated pattern recognition, you won't like this.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   I loved pattern.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040]   Who didn't like pattern?
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.520]   Were there people who wanted neuromancer?
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.040]   Is that what the issue was there?
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:27.040]   You know, they're more seamless eyeglass implants and strange karate internet battles.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.040]   Hey, I love you.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   Look, don't get me wrong.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.040]   Learning glasses, burning, excuse me, burning chrome, actually, is one of my favorite collections
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.040]   of sharing stories all the time.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.040]   I really love that.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.040]   So is it cyberpunk or is it the end of cyberpunk?
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.040]   No, it's very similar.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:48.680]   It's a similar universe to the one that takes place in pattern recognition where it's contemporary,
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:54.400]   it's kind of elite hipster, people chasing ephemerial trends in society.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.800]   I loved to.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.920]   Pattern recognition was about somebody who had a sensitivity to...
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.920]   Brands.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.920]   Brands, actually.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.040]   So the stronger a brand logo was, the more likely she was to sort of puke it or a choose.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.040]   That's great.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.040]   I just loved that.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.920]   We interviewed William Gibson right after that came out.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   And we did.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   I remember talking to him.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.920]   Big fan of his stuff.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   I love pattern recognition.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:22.400]   Spook Country is just out in hardcover, but you can get it at audible.com as well.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.880]   And I'm sure it's a great listen.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.320]   It's on my next listen.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.560]   That's one of the things I like about Audible.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.840]   It's a cue just like Netflix where you queue up your next book.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:35.160]   And then automatically every month I get a new book and I just cannot wait.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.640]   Spook Country by William Gibson.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.320]   That's our pick for the week.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.640]   One of many, many, many books you can get at audible.com/twit.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.920]   We really encourage you if you haven't yet signed up for audible.com to take advantage
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.800]   of that offer audible.com/twit.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.640]   And if you are already an Audible member and I know most of our listeners now are Audible
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.680]   members, this is a good one.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.080]   Spook Country from William Gibson.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:05.600]   You know, we have an email from Christopher Moore who wrote a series of just great vampire
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   books.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.280]   He's the latest and he just sent me all his stuff and it's all in audible.com.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.920]   And I didn't know he's a fan of Twit.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   Very cool.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   I like the title, The Stupidest Angel.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.920]   Oh, yeah, baby.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.680]   Yeah, his titles are fantastic.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.680]   I can't wait to read one of those.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.680]   He's a Twit fan.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.480]   I had no idea.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:26.640]   At longtime tech TV viewer, he sent me a great note and a bunch of audio books.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.360]   So Chris, it's good to meet you.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.360]   We'll get you.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:34.400]   We'll get him on Mac break weekly because apparently he's making the move to Mac from
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   PC.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.200]   He's using parallels to make it easier for him.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.200]   Very nice.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   So there's another one actually.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   We'll add that.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   Make a secondary book.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.400]   That's also an audible use suck by Christopher Moore.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.400]   Chris Moore.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.920]   He separate the numinous from the quotidian.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.720]   We're talking about a little log rolling on the back of the William Gibson book by, was
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.680]   it the San Francisco Chronicle reviewer?
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:01.760]   No, actually, I think that was the Washington Post book world.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.840]   A writer who can conjure the numinous out of the quotidian.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.840]   I just love that.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.840]   That's good.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:08.840]   I plan to.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.840]   You know what?
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.040]   When I get home tonight, I'm going to conjure the numinous out of the quotidian.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.040]   Well, you know how?
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.760]   You still won't be the great poet of crowds, which is what the San Francisco Examiner
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.760]   in Chronicle said.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.000]   Great poet of crowds.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.120]   I have to think about that one.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.520]   Not sure what that means exactly.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.520]   Not sure.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:29.240]   I guess if you can have the wisdom of the crowds, you can have the poetry of the crowd.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   Yeah, sure.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   But sure.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.240]   That wouldn't be an author.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.240]   That would just be a thing.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.240]   The madness of crowd is a great read by the way.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.840]   The madness of crowds is the opposite of the wisdom of crowds.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.840]   Yes.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.840]   Who wrote the idiocy of crowds?
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.840]   An Italian fellow.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.240]   I remember that.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.000]   Computer problem strands 25.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.280]   This is why you don't want to fly into Los Angeles International Airport, Will Harris.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:57.840]   Computer problem strands 2500 international passengers for five hours Saturday at LAX
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.600]   because the customs computer was broke.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.440]   Oops.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.880]   It was broke.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.480]   They actually started rerouting flights to other airports.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.600]   No, this wasn't because that was one of the things that came out at Blackhead as researchers
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.880]   have figured out how to crash passport RFID regions.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.880]   Right.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.880]   Right.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:17.880]   And they believe that's kind of like once you can crash it.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.040]   I'm now formed JPEG and it goes.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.080]   And they feel that's kind of like the baby step towards being able to actually hack the
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.080]   passport.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   Sure.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.720]   If you cross a buffer overflow, now you just have to figure out where to insert content.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   Creepy.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   Creepy.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:36.680]   The New York Times article, they were able to put up a backup system, but only half of
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.480]   the inspection booths could support it.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.840]   So they had a backup system, but only half of the people could use it.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   And that's what's fun.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   That's why.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   I mean.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.840]   Oh, we upgraded to 98.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   You can't run it.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.320]   I get a, I get a new passport recently and the idea of the RFID tag in there because
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   there's one of the guys.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:58.800]   I know the guys from Flexalus who, who, who do the, who figured out how to, you know,
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.520]   read an RFID tag from a passive.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.360]   And it's just like, you know, there's a, there's a rubber band around mine.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.240]   I'm looking for the tin foil hat for you.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:12.440]   You can buy and I think it's, it's either Magellan's is one of the online travel sites.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.880]   You could buy a tin foil passport wallet, a special lead.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:16.880]   It's actually led lead.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:17.880]   I bought one of those.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.720]   It's safe way.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.240]   When you were trying to do that special check out, you know, it was called aluminum foil.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.240]   Aluminum foil.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.480]   Yeah, I can imagine like it was hard enough for me to get into Canada when I went up
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.480]   to Vancouver.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.480]   Did you get a question?
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.000]   What do you have a bunch of electronics with you?
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.400]   Yeah, at a couple, yeah, a $200 camcorders with me.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.400]   Oh, there you go.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   You get slagged out of line.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.520]   I guess I wasn't carrying enough luggage and I was only in town for 24 hours.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.520]   Ergo, I must be a security.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:50.640]   I gotta say, if I see Patrick Norton coming into town for one day with that massive backpack
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.320]   that you carry around, I'm going to strip search him too.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.760]   I, I, he's up to no good.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   There's no question about it.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.040]   Yeah, it'd be a lot funnier if it wasn't me.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.040]   We were talking about it.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.640]   We were in your kilt too.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.920]   No, I was, I was looking very much like an upstanding citizen.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.160]   Actually, I was might have said that.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.160]   You could have worn your kilt.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.880]   You might have gotten through no problem.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:09.880]   That was the problem, yeah.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:11.880]   I don't know.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.040]   I, I don't know what we love the, we love the guys and kills up in Canada.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.560]   Oh yeah, we do.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:23.840]   A judge has overturned that big patent judgment against Microsoft from Alcatel Lucent.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.760]   This is, you know, I tell you this patent situation is just a mess.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:32.320]   The judge said Microsoft did not violate the patent after all and said one of the two
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.480]   patents and says the second one's on shaky ground.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.840]   That was the biggest award in history.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.640]   Remember it was a $1.52 billion award.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.920]   It's a MP3 compression patent.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.840]   Lucent got the technology.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:49.000]   Alcatel bought the technology from Fraunhofer or Sino knows that we tried to describe it
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.880]   last time and I never got, got it right.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.240]   Well, eventually the judge decided that actually Fraunhofer did.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.240]   They licensed it.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.240]   Owned part of the technology.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.080]   So they were capable of licensing it.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.880]   So Microsoft had obtained it legally.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:03.040]   So in actual fact, there was no case to answer.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.040]   I think that's great for everybody else.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:12.440]   I think Arstechka had the first almost lucid explanation of this.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:16.840]   The underlight tech was developed by the labs and Fraunhofer together.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.760]   Bell Labs became Lucent and so they both own it.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.320]   Yes.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.560]   You own this half.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.640]   You own the other half.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:29.320]   And that's why they're at odds over it because they both think they have the patent.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:34.600]   So I actually ordered the new Mac, the new iMac, but soon as the Apple Store opened it's
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.600]   so pretty.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.560]   It looks just like my iPhone only 24 inches.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.840]   You got the 24 inch one?
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   Yeah, with the extreme.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.840]   Am I crazy?
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.840]   I don't know.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.640]   I think the 20 inch one looks huge.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.880]   Well 24, it's going to be like...
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.840]   Yeah, I like those 24 inch screens.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.000]   I got the Dell 24 in there.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   I love it.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.320]   So for those of you who aren't staring at Leo's desk with the pathetic 19 inch Samsung monitor
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.320]   next to the what?
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:57.320]   39 inch Apple monitor.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.320]   It's just 30.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.320]   The 30 inch Apple monitor.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.320]   Where are you going to play?
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.320]   Where's the 20 inch?
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.320]   Oh, that's for her.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.320]   It should be 24 inch.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   I'm putting it right here and then I'll be like...
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.320]   I don't know.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   I won't have any more children.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.320]   That's for sure.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.200]   Yeah, wrap things with tin foil.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:16.600]   And actually there's a lot of controversy over the new iLife because Apple completely
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.960]   wrote iPhone and took out a lot of the capabilities of...
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.960]   I'm not iPhone.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:21.960]   Did I say iPhone?
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.600]   iMovie and took out a lot of the capabilities of iMovie.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   No plugins.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.240]   Although they added a capability that I think is very interesting.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.160]   A direct post to YouTube.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.680]   In fact, Google is all over this new release.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.600]   I just realized I'm on camera.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.600]   Sorry.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.600]   No, no, it's okay.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   Does that make broadcast?
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:41.600]   No, no, it's just on.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:46.720]   I'm just taping it for the lawsuit later.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:50.280]   I web application has built in Google AdSense.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.920]   I think this nexus between Apple and Google is getting clearer and clearer.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.520]   I mean, what's going on with the features they removed from iMovie?
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.880]   Is that because they want to push people to find a fair...
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   To find a little kid express.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.880]   I just...
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.520]   What happens is that what's going on because they rewrote it from the ground up.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.320]   It's like, and it wasn't that great to begin with honestly, but then why start totally
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.320]   over?
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.320]   I mean, iMovie is a really nice tool.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   It gets the job done.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.640]   Basically, if you want to hack together some video really fast, iMovie is great.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.720]   Well, what they should have done is renamed it.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.240]   They should have said it's not iMovie, it's home movie because you like this because it's
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.320]   great for bang and stuff out.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:22.320]   It just has fewer...
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.320]   There's no plugins.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.320]   It's a shame that they know the plugins.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.320]   No themes.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:31.760]   There's far fewer transitions, far fewer titling capabilities, but it has this really cool
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.480]   thing which you will love called skimming.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:38.040]   In fact, it's all over iLife where you can live preview any thumbnail just by dragging
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.000]   the mouse over and seeing it.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.240]   You got to see it.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.240]   It's really quite impressive.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.240]   I know.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.240]   It's because it's a fully real time rendering.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.600]   You throw a transition in, it's there.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.600]   It's already there.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.480]   Yeah, because there's a miserable...
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.000]   It's a miserable climb up to go from iMovie to...
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   It is.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   I agree.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.640]   I'm an i-like iMovie.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.920]   I don't want final because it's too much for me.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   Not merely in price.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.240]   Express is 300 bucks, but complexity.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.240]   They've gotten rid of the timeline.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.240]   It's gone.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.480]   There's no audio, separate audio track.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.960]   Audio mixing has gone.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.160]   It's a very different program.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.640]   The story that Apple's giving out is that one of their video engineers came back from
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.440]   a trip, tried to make a movie with iMovie.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.360]   So this is still complicated and wrote a much simpler version.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.440]   That's why iLife was delayed by a year.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.760]   They skipped a whole release year.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.440]   All I have to do is not upgrade iLife and I'll still have to...
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.600]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:30.040]   When you install it, the old iMovie stays there and you can still download iMovie if you
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.800]   have iLife0.8 and you want iMovie, you can download it.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.680]   So Apple realizes that there's a little issue here.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.400]   At least until they close that loophole.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.400]   Right.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.400]   Get it while you can.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:47.080]   I think the rest of the whole Mac software update was a bit of a squib.
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.760]   I mean, certainly the update's to .Mac.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.880]   Well, 10 gigabytes instead of one.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.080]   They needed to do that.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.600]   Yeah, but it's nowhere near enough.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.920]   I mean, Google has already given you, you know, goodness knows how much storage for nothing.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:05.280]   You know, you've got to pay $100 a year just to get 10 gigabytes.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.960]   And you're thinking, well, you've got to pay double that if you want to go up to 30 gigabytes.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.560]   I'm happy with the 10.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.480]   I mean, I just have some special stuff there.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.920]   Mostly I use .Mac for the synchronization.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.720]   When new features in GarageBand, you get the capability of kind of, they call it magic
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.080]   garage band, creating backing tracks.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.080]   That's good for a musician.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.920]   If you want to, you know, create a quick backing track and play to it, it's easier to do.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.840]   You don't have to do magic garage band scene for a dozen.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.520]   You know, I think the most interesting thing is numbers, which is the spreadsheet that's
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.520]   now part of iWork.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.400]   They always had a presentation manager and a word processor.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:42.600]   Those are both considerably improved, but numbers is a pretty, it's not Excel.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.440]   I mean, it's not going to be for the office.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.640]   But for home users who are doing, you know, dinner, I know a friend of mine does dinner
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.560]   party planning with Excel.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.400]   He does seating charts in Excel.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.880]   This would be a much better, I know.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:55.360]   This would be a much better choice.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:59.760]   Or the kids baseball schedule or the kinds of stuff that home users do.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.800]   This is a really nice, I think, a beautiful job.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.400]   Could they have just done this whole announcement with a press release though?
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   But there were only two other people there.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.400]   That's what Molly Wood was telling me.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.520]   She was like, you know, she went and she's like, I don't really feel like I had to be
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.520]   there.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.520]   No.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.800]   She's like, I don't really feel like I had to see Molly finally getting bitter about wasting
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:16.800]   time.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.800]   She hates the Mac.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.800]   She hates the Mac.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.800]   Let's be honest.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   She doesn't hate the Mac and the PC though.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.800]   And Linux.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:23.800]   Well, as long as she's an equal opportunity.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   It's a Mac.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.400]   What a great choice for tech correspondents.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:33.280]   Actually, that makes her just fearably honest about making it like a Dvorak is what it
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.280]   makes her different.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.280]   A fee for Dvorak.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   Cranky.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.080]   But I did feel like when I was, you know, following along on the live blog, I was like,
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.200]   there's really not much that I'm getting excited about.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.920]   It's like the spreadsheet was the biggest news.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.320]   Like, oh, they finally got, you know, they've got numbers.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.320]   That's great.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:50.880]   Well, the other thing I think is interesting, and I talked a little bit about this on the
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:55.240]   radio show that we're already seeing benchmark numbers of the new IMEX are not particularly
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   faster.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:58.440]   They're very small percentage faster.
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:03.400]   It's really a what it really is is a Detroit style new model year.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.920]   It's a way to get people to buy new computers and well, it's actually, they don't need
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   to.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920]   They push the prices down a little bit.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.920]   A little bit less expensive.
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:15.920]   If you look at the refurbished 20 inches of the old model, it's only like 500, you know,
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.480]   you're only saving like less than a thousand over the new model.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.480]   Right.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   It's, yeah.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.440]   And you can go, you can go crazy upgrading them to, you know, you can get up to a terabyte
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.440]   and four gigs of RAM and that pretty powerful machines.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.520]   They're beautiful machines.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.240]   But again, I think it's really all about saying to people, you don't want that old
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.240]   design.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:39.040]   You want the new design because there's no other compelling reason for most people to
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.040]   upgrade a computer.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.320]   Because the other thing to look at is like if you look at the same, the equivalent power
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.880]   for a, you know, a Dell desktop, it's pretty awe inspiring to realize how much that fabulous
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.360]   new design is costing you.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.560]   You know, notebooks, they're very competitive in price, but the desktops, they're starting
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.400]   to be a bit of a lag.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.760]   But you can you put four gigs in that Dell desktop of RAM?
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.600]   Could you put these four gigabytes of RAM?
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.640]   I mean, look, two gigabytes is a lot for most people.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   You do if you want to run Windows and Mac at the same time.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   And I guess that kind of you're right.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.200]   That kind of, I don't know.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.120]   I think for people who use Photoshop, this is going to be a nice Photoshop, but tool if
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.560]   you're doing a lot of music and garage band or something more powerful, more.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.240]   The only diner is the graphics cards they put in it.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.080]   The Radeon 2000 series is pretty lame.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.560]   Very odd that they chose such a low end.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.520]   It's a 99 buck graphics card, basically.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.080]   Well, I'm pretty sure ATI is giving it to them for, you know, pennies on the dollar for
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.320]   the sake of, you know, just shifting some cards.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:40.320]   This is they're using the Radeon HD 2400 and 2600.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.880]   And yeah, the benchmarks I've seen, it's not an impressive card at all.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.200]   They were much better choices from Nvidia, for instance.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.200]   Well, yes.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.960]   Maybe they want you to buy the big expensive box.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.960]   No, you can't.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.680]   Oh, the Mac Pro, I see what you're saying.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.680]   Yeah, maybe, maybe.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.400]   Well, we're going to wrap this up unless you want to talk about the 8 million year old
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.240]   bacteria or frightening.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240]   Quake con.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.840]   Did you have anything to talk about with Quake con?
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.720]   I know you're a Quake fan, will there?
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.360]   I mean, there was a couple of good cons last weekend because Quake con happened.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360]   And the only time.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:16.600]   And officially announced like Rage, which is their new game for PC, Mac, Xbox, PlayStation,
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.360]   which looks super, super good.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.360]   High death.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:25.320]   But also the new, there was Blizzcon last weekend with the new World of Warcraft expansion.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.560]   And I know for all the wiring players out there, that's going to be pretty exciting.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.560]   What's that?
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.120]   So, what's it going to be called?
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.120]   It's the...
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.600]   The Wrath of the Lich King.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.600]   Who is...
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.160]   And actually, if you sort of follow the mythology, the Lich King is actually one of the characters
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.360]   from Warcraft 3.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.360]   That's right.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360]   One of the hero characters.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   Right.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.080]   And so he makes an appearance in...
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.680]   He's sort of the theme for the new World of expansion.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.760]   And there's also going to be a new hero class.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:55.760]   Gosh.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.800]   A new hero class like Dark Knight or something, which is super, super duper.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.400]   Are they going to give you a new level or you can go past 70 now?
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.840]   Yeah, you got a 2018 name.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.760]   Boy, this is a money-making franchise.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.760]   You know, I mean...
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   It's awesome, isn't it?
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.760]   Oh, you're going to do it, say...
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.160]   8 billion people, 10 bucks a month.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.160]   That's a lot of it.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.520]   And then another 70 bucks, so you can be go up to 80 level, you know?
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.520]   Crazy.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.960]   Or meet the Lich King down at the pub.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.960]   Geez.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.760]   What a brilliant...
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.760]   I mean, you know...
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.360]   Would you put it that way, actually?
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.680]   That might be kind of fun.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.840]   Oh, by the way, I can put 4 gigabytes of RAM into the $600 Dell I've just configured with
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840]   the 20-inch model.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840]   Okay.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840]   With the core 2...
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.840]   You've been working on it ever since then.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.840]   Oh, this one's an AMP model.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.840]   I'll put together a core 2-2-0.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.840]   Core 2.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.840]   Okay.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.840]   So...
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840]   And then don't forget, you don't get iLife, you don't...
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.840]   I mean, it's $79 for a full office suite.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.240]   You know, I own a Mac and I've yet to...
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.360]   Other than the occasion of the iMovie, I don't really use iLife.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.920]   What do you do on your Mac?
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.920]   Reading, writing, Rithmatik.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.920]   A lot of...
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   You use Firefox or Safari?
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   Firefox.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.240]   I use a pile of stuff.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   You know what?
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.840]   I've left Firefox and gone back to Safari, mostly because Firefox just...
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.040]   Firefox 2 just seems buggy as heck to me.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.680]   But Safari is very fast.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.680]   You don't like Safari, huh?
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.680]   Can't stand it.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.680]   Can't stand it.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.680]   Hate it.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.680]   Hate it.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.680]   Hate it.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:23.200]   Well, I hope we've brought a little numina to your "Tydian" podcast listening.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.720]   Will, do you want to say anything about what your new venture is up?
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.720]   Is it all about?
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.720]   Oh, no.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.720]   Apart from...
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.360]   We're very close.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.600]   We're very, very close to doing something.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600]   Oh, come on.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600]   It's really...
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.560]   What are you talking about?
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.560]   Will's.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.560]   Starting at...
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.560]   It has a startup.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.560]   It is going to be a very...
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.560]   It's...
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.560]   I'm gonna...
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.560]   Can I say...
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.280]   Can I say it's going to be the revision three of the UK?
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.160]   Can I say that?
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.960]   I think there's probably a few people that revision three.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.560]   I smack you over the head for that.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.800]   But, you know, the principle is online video.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.520]   I think it's a revision three.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.520]   Are you starting an online video network?
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.120]   Does it have a technology focus?
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.120]   No.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.120]   No.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.120]   Really?
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.120]   That's what's interesting.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.360]   So, we're doing like a... we are doing like a tech show and a video game show.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:17.240]   We also have like fitness and films and indie music and men's fashion and that kind of thing.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.760]   So, it's a lad video network.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.760]   He's a lad.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.800]   A pro content of decent stuff.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.440]   Well done stuff, yeah.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.440]   I've seen a lot of them.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.600]   And we've just been there.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:34.280]   We just signed some premises for some video studio stuff and, you know, picking up all
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.520]   the HD cameras and stuff.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   So, that's pretty exciting.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.200]   I dragged this out of you, will you mind?
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.680]   I'm not gonna edit this out if you don't want any more.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.680]   What's the name of it?
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.280]   We're not gonna launch till the middle of September.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.080]   So, you got a little ways to go.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.080]   What's the name of it?
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.080]   It's channelflip.com.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.080]   Channelflip.com.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.760]   Oh, see, we really got it all out of you.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.760]   And how are you gonna monetize it?
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   Advertizing.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.280]   I think it's natural to be monetized.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.280]   That's not the question.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.280]   Good buddy.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.280]   How did you monetize DLTV?
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.080]   How do you have a revision three gonna monetize?
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.640]   I think this is the next big thing, don't you?
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.360]   I mean, look at all the money going into revision three.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.520]   They're building a whole new studio right now.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.440]   Pretty amazing.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   Pretty amazing.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.520]   Tom Merritt, you're at CNET TV and they're doing great and buzz out loud.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.760]   Yes, I am glad I have no secrets for you to drag out of me.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.200]   I still haven't dragged Patrick's secret out of him, but I know if I did, he would
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.200]   clobber me.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.360]   The real secret is that I may be blogging on my website.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.360]   What?
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.360]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.000]   My balls about to pop.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   I can't.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   Oh.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Okay.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.400]   Oh, you're sitting on the bouncy ball.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.000]   Oh, you should explain that, I think.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   Yes, thank you.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.800]   He has one of those really good for your lower back and abdominals.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.800]   Great.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.040]   My core strength is amazing, but I still can't handle what you just said.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.440]   You're about to blog?
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.440]   I was gonna try to blog once a year on St. Patrick's Day.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.440]   That's a good tradition.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.640]   I figured once every other year on St. Patrick's Day and I was traveling with my wife.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.640]   I got it again.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.840]   So, you know, maybe once every three years is still.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.320]   St. Swillens Day, maybe.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.320]   That's good.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.320]   St. Crispin's Day.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.320]   St. Crispin's Day.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   Patrick Norton.com/blog.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:11.320]   No, actually Patrick Norton is now somebody at Domain Squad or as Patrick Norton.com.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.320]   Okay.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.320]   Pastards.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.600]   Ah, you know what, they got it fair and square.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.600]   What'd you...
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.600]   Rist wrestle on what?
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.600]   No, I...
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600]   You just ignored it.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600]   I didn't...
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.600]   They registered it.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600]   They registered it.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.600]   But, Patrick Barton.com is available.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.040]   Would you like me to get that for you?
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.440]   I'm good, thank you.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.440]   There's enough confusion.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:34.480]   I'll tell you what, I'll let you know next week where I will be...
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480]   Deal.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.280]   My presence on the interwebs.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.280]   Next week, Patrick reveals all on a very special edition.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.120]   And then I'll link to you from TomMarrot.com.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.120]   Cool.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.720]   Can I get a link from Subreliant2?
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.720]   Sure.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720]   You can.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.720]   I've got X7 blogs.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.720]   I'm all of them.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.480]   We'll do simultaneous releases of East, meets West and Twit.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.800]   I want to see how fast I can get a webpage I put together to be the top reference page
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.120]   for Patrick Norton.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.600]   So, you don't have a URL yet.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.960]   I've got several URLs.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.760]   I just need to put something on one of them.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.760]   You need something to hit like Pea Niddy or something.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.040]   Yeah, because that's so me.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.040]   I'm so hip.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.040]   Mr. Peanini.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.040]   You are?
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.960]   I'm into the clash on the way up here.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   I'm so...
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:16.960]   Oh, I'm so hip.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.960]   Let me see.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.400]   I'm just checking for you.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.400]   That's really frightening.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.600]   A guy in a kilt.com is available.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.600]   That's really frightening.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.440]   A guy in a kilt.net.org.info.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.240]   In fact, a guy in a kilt.anything is available.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.240]   That's the brand.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.040]   It won't be about five minutes after this hits the...
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.520]   Well, that means you have a few minutes to get it.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.840]   A guy in a kilt.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:37.840]   That's good.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.760]   What else do we have?
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.680]   How about Mr. Lunchbox?
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.680]   [laughter]
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.680]   Really?
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.760]   I think so.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.760]   I like it.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.520]   It's available though.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.760]   I'm sure it is.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   No, wait a minute.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.320]   Somebody has Mr. Lunchbox.com and .net.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:56.760]   It's obviously my dreams of becoming the next Martha Stewart have been dashing on the
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.760]   same.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.760]   You can see Mr. Lunchbox.tv.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.920]   Patrick Norton Antivirus.com is available.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:02.920]   [laughter]
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:08.200]   Even Norton cannot protect you now.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.600]   The numeral from the quotidian.com is, in fact, wide open.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   Because slam dance industry wasn't a long and complicated enough URL.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.440]   Well, nobody knows what slam dance industry is.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.200]   Well, that's part of the joy, right?
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.720]   Look at the numeral from the quotidian.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.720]   FMAM.jobs.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.840]   You can have a whole jobs board there.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840]   The numeral for...
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.600]   Hey, it's Steve Jobs.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.520]   Steve.jobs would be great.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.480]   Oh, that can't be available.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.480]   Oh, no.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480]   Can it?
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.400]   That guy, the Forbes guy, what's his name?
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400]   Daniel Lyons.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.720]   The guy who is the fake.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.920]   Daniel Lyons is a fake.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.040]   Steve.AM and Steve.MD are available.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.680]   If you're a doctor named Steve, I'd run out and get Steve.MD.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.680]   That's awesome.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.360]   It's probably a bit like a Simpsons thing now.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:53.520]   Hello, it's Dr. Steve.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.440]   Would you trust a guy, a doctor?
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.640]   Goodbye, everybody.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.560]   And come see my website, Steve.MD.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.560]   I don't think so.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   I don't think so.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.280]   What's that site you're looking up all the URLs on?
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.280]   Dotster.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.280]   I like Dotster.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.280]   That's my...
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.280]   Farguingpatric.com is available.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.280]   Oh, that's good.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280]   [laughter]
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.640]   Yeah, it's going to not make a lot of sense to a lot of people.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.640]   So we can squeaky...
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.760]   Leo.MD is available too.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   I could be a doctor.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.640]   I'm not a doctor, but I play with it.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.640]   I play with it.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.640]   I play with it.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   So is it still Slamdance industry for now?
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   No, no, no.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.200]   Just make no announcements.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.200]   Make no announcements?
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.080]   Let me actually post something, then we'll point people to it.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.760]   What we set it up on Blogger or something.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.760]   What are we set it up on?
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.760]   Vlogs, we'll type.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.760]   We'll type.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:40.760]   Okay, and it's still there.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:41.760]   I think.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:42.760]   One post.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:43.760]   I'm charging my credit card.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.760]   That one post.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   [laughter]
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.720]   All right, well, it's been great talking to you all.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.960]   I thank you so much, Tom, for joining us.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:11:00.760]   B-O-L.CNET.com and CNETTV.com and EastmeetsWest and all the sub-brilliant.com.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.760]   Tom Barrett.com, I-70Clinic.com.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.760]   What is I-70Clinic.com?
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.760]   I-70Clinic.com, I-70Clinic.com.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.760]   Let's see.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:12.520]   Baseball Coaches Clinic in Southern Illinois site that I run for my friend Mark Jurgena.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.520]   I get the mail for them.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.520]   You do.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520]   That's hilarious.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.120]   It's a beautiful WordPress template.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.120]   I like it.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.280]   Oh, and Medico is working on a fix for their locks.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.040]   And Medco is working on a fix for their locks.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.040]   Good to know.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.040]   Very good to know.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.120]   So quickly, if you've got a bump hammer, quickly use it.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.600]   Thank you so much, Will Harris.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.400]   And good luck with the announcement.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.800]   Please, as you know more, let us know more because we'd love to tell the world.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.800]   Absolutely.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.960]   Meanwhile, it's WhereIsWill@WILHarris.co.uk.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:46.160]   I know it's supposed to be .co.uk, but- Sorry, now I'm envisioning Will in a red and white
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.040]   striped hat.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.800]   Like, I don't get it.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.800]   Like what?
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.800]   Like Wall-Toe.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.800]   Like Wall-Toe.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.800]   Where's Wall-Toe?
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.800]   Where's Will?
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.800]   He's got the glasses.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.240]   Patrick Norton, we don't know where he lives or where he's going to be on the net, but stay
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.240]   tuned.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.240]   Stay tuned.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.240]   Stay tuned for more.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.240]   Moving to Utah.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.240]   I can't plug you.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.240]   I'm moving to Selena.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240]   Selena, Kansas?
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.680]   California Unemployment Commission?
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:15.760]   Look for Patrick Norton in an unemployment line near you.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.760]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.760]   We'll see you next week.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.760]   Another Twit.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.760]   This is amazing.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:19.760]   Is in the can.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:26.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:32.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.760]   Alright.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.760]   I should have paid attention.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.760]   I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760]   Too much work.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.640]   My server's completely collapsed.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   So here's the deal.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.560]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.560]   like forget it.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.560]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.560]   Round the horn.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.560]   Round the horn.
