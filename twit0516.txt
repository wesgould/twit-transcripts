[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.800]   did the Google car, the self-driving car
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.440]   almost hit another self-driving car?
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.380]   Why Facebook is hanging Cat5 cable for no apparent reason?
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.520]   And why Apple should be sending a well-written thank you note
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.560]   to Taylor Swift?
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.280]   Yes, that story lives on.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.320]   And Twint is coming up next, stay tuned.

[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.120]   But I am Becky Worley and this is going to be a great show.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.480]   We are celebrating with Leo.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.320]   He has asked me to step in and host TWIT this week
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.680]   because he is on his honeymoon,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.680]   off on a cruise somewhere in a body of water in Europe.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.080]   That's all I know, secret location that cannot be disclosed.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.600]   But I will be leading you through this week's technology news.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.000]   You can follow me on Twitter, I'm @bwerley.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.280]   I'm a correspondent for technology and consumer issues
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.800]   for ABC News, Good Morning America.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.680]   And I am thrilled to be joined this week
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.560]   by the crew that will be saving me
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.120]   from standing in the shadow of a man
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.000]   who is irreplaceable Leo LePour.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.400]   So Ian Thompson from the Register,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.720]   thank you so much for coming up here to Petaluma.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.360]   - Not appropriate, thank you for having me.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.800]   NASCAR traffic wasn't too bad.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.920]   - Yeah, NASCAR event, there's a fair going on.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.080]   - Dead at playing as well.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.560]   - The dead played, yes.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.640]   One of our tech TV alumni, Jim Lauterback,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.280]   was basically live tweeting the show last night.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   So it was an event down at Levi Stadium.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.040]   Also via Skype, Georgia Dow at Georgia_Dow.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.920]   She is, you've probably seen or heard her
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.960]   on the iMore podcast.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.560]   I was reading your bio, you're also a therapist?
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.920]   - I'm a psychotherapist, yeah.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.360]   I deal with anxiety and depression,
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.720]   parenting, those type of things.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.880]   - Okay, this is just really gonna be me
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.160]   pouring my soul out to you.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   We won't be talking about tech news this week at all.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.000]   Now.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.240]   - Can I get in line for that too?
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.560]   - Yeah, Jason Heiner is here for some therapies,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.240]   for some support, for some discussion of all things.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.040]   - You guys didn't know, but that's actually
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.360]   why we're all here together.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.880]   - It's an intervention.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   - Right.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.280]   - Ah, beautiful.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.560]   - Jason Heiner is editor in chief at Tech Republic.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.440]   He's author of Follow the Geeks,
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.200]   and you can find that great book
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.360]   at followthegeeksbook.com.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.560]   Jason, you're joining us from Kentucky?
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.720]   - Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.000]   Yes indeed.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.120]   - Hotbed of technology.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.520]   - Yeah, CBS Interactive has a big office here.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.560]   Tech Republic was founded here during the .com boom.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.600]   And so most of my editorial team
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.800]   is still in Louisville to this day.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.320]   So that's home base.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.200]   - I love that about ZD and seeing that
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.880]   and all of the dispersive kind of reporters.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.000]   And it gives a great perspective
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.080]   that's not just San Francisco or New York.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.960]   So I think that's awesome.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.800]   I follow us.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.920]   - Yeah, people in six cities, it's awesome.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.600]   It's very cool.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.520]   - One of my favorite writers is Stephen Shankland,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.120]   and he's a CNET writer who's now in Paris
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.720]   and has such a different perspective on things.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.120]   So we are thrilled to have you, Jason.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.960]   And let's just jump into things.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.040]   It's a little bit of a recap
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.280]   because last week's big story was that Taylor Swift
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.200]   had written this letter to Apple saying
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.800]   she was not going to participate
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.680]   in their streaming service
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.280]   because for the first three months,
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.760]   they were telling artists that they weren't going
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.640]   to compensate them for any songs
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.120]   that were streamed during this trial period.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.360]   Well, since then, Apple has changed their mind.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.520]   That was the big news.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.520]   Taylor Swift has said,
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.920]   yes, her 1989 album will be streamed.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.400]   And I would say, Jason, the question to you is,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.560]   this has actually been a good thing for Apple
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   because they have also locked a few indie labels.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.240]   They locked Beggars Group and Merlin.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.880]   We're talking about production labels
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.320]   that represent Adele Radiohead.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.960]   Does Apple owe Taylor Swift a great big thank you?
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.000]   - Yeah, no doubt.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.520]   I mean, it's brought so much more attention
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.000]   to what Apple Music is doing than it would have otherwise.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.280]   And Taylor Swift's letter to them, open letter,
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.160]   as it were, was very respectful and very well reasoned.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.600]   And she said, look, I'm not doing this for me.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   I can pay my people just by doing gigs, doing live music,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.840]   but that people who were doing their first record,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.680]   doing their first album, putting their first song on there,
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.000]   if they're going to lose out on all of that money,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.640]   that could really, really hurt people.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.080]   And she basically was standing up
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.840]   for other people in the industry.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.680]   And Apple heard it loud and clear, changed their tune.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.720]   And it brought so much attention to what Apple was doing
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.360]   and what Apple is going to be releasing with Apple Music
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.320]   that another artist, I think, liked the fact
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.040]   that they backed down and they changed their policy on it
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.600]   that they jumped on board.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.840]   And so I think for Apple in one sense,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.480]   you kind of can't buy publicity like that.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.720]   And it's also a good lesson, I think, in business
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.720]   and sort of corporate policies of turning negative
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.560]   into a positive.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   Sometimes you do dumb things and it's your reaction to it
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.120]   that can actually turn it around and show that you do listen
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.520]   or that you do have sort of the larger,
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.440]   something larger in mind and aren't so set in your way.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.640]   So this turned into just a really interesting thing.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.920]   It also showed, as many people have pointed out,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   the power that Taylor Swift has right now.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.080]   - Right, and I think that's a really big question
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.880]   because if Taylor Swift can jump in here and say,
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.520]   listen, the recording label sold us down the river
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.000]   by not negotiating on our behalf
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.840]   to get us those royalties and payments in the first three months,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.640]   then she goes directly to Apple,
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.760]   circumvents the labels, I think it begs the question,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.960]   Georgia, do you think or Ian, do you think that this is us
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.440]   and this is why I think this is newsworthy,
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.240]   even though this is sort of last week,
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.240]   is that does this point to the question
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.720]   of what are the labels doing for the artists
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.320]   if they're not representing them
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.600]   with the streaming services in a way
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.880]   that really is to the artist benefit?
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.160]   - I understand. - Yeah, I think that,
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.020]   I think that in time records are gonna become more
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.560]   and more obsolete as there, again, now artists can reach
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.200]   directly to the people, people can directly buy things
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.800]   from the artists, they can speak to the artists,
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.660]   they can publicize themselves.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.340]   And I think that it showed a lot of power
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.800]   of what one artist, she's a huge artist in the field,
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.680]   but what one artist can do.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.780]   And my hats off to Apple for responding immediately,
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.440]   responding so quick, they did it on Twitter, no less.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.720]   And it comes down to equity, all of the indie labels
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.440]   that they got, like 20,000 because of this,
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.700]   they just wanted a small piece in return,
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.500]   it's like 0.2 cents, it's almost nothing,
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.420]   but it makes a difference, it's just a little bit of equity
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.380]   for everyone and they just wanted it to be fair.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.300]   So I think it's wonderful, but Becky, your point is great.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.140]   Yeah, do we really need the record labels
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.340]   and are they gonna become obsolete sooner rather than later?
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.940]   - I do think it does highlight a difference
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.220]   in the way that Apple deals with these things now.
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.260]   If Steve Jobs has still been at the head of the company,
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.660]   I suspect the reaction would not have been so quick,
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.700]   nor so polite.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.200]   He would much prefer to go up against someone
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   who was trying to challenge his power.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.920]   Apple did something very, very smart in backing down.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.160]   Basically, they turned what was a disastrous situation
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.840]   into a good one rather than turning into a catastrophe
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.920]   because when they announced they weren't gonna pay
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.360]   for this music, everyone was just like,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.040]   you're the richest company in the world
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.360]   and you're not paying artists to promote your service,
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.700]   it's insane.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.900]   - It's 0.2 cents per stream,
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.120]   so it's five, basically five streams
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.360]   is a penny for the artist.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.260]   There's also a 0.0 for the--
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.820]   - For the record labels, actually.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.980]   - For the labels, that's why--
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.100]   - Even less for the artist.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.860]   - Right, and there's 0.047 on top of that,
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.980]   I read somewhere that's for the rights.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.420]   So we're talking about four streams as a penny.
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.780]   I mean, it's ridiculous that they wouldn't pay.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.540]   And going back to the label question,
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.740]   I think it's just, it's inexcusable
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.860]   that they didn't represent their artists
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.500]   and especially as the grounds are shifting,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.620]   they should know by now.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.840]   They've already been burned once by a disrupted industry.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.800]   Meanwhile, over at Title,
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.000]   Jay Z's music streaming service,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.640]   they booted their CEO,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.000]   they've got somewhere--
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.960]   - And a whole bunch of other stuff as well.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.920]   - Right, and they've only got about 800,000 subscribers,
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.680]   compared that to Spotify's 20 million.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.080]   They're trying to do the collective
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.360]   and the collective is the streaming company.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.660]   Meanwhile, Taylor Swift is basically advocating
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.000]   for artists directly, cutting the labels completely out.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.160]   Where do you think Apple will find,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.700]   in their streaming service,
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.460]   are they gonna be able to work their way into this,
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.460]   given how much of a shifting sands environment it is?
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.500]   - I think if Apple is smart,
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.020]   they're gonna go direct to the artists.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.940]   Labels are increasingly irrelevant these days.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.860]   I mean, it used to be that labels would find talent,
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.640]   bring it together, promote it, get it all out there.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.720]   Now, artists can do that themselves.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.680]   So, the labels have already seen the value
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.160]   of their back catalogs crash,
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.920]   thanks to Napster and other things over the years.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.120]   And now, artists, as you say,
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.560]   can appeal directly to their listeners.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.680]   It's coming to the point now,
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.040]   where labels really have to do something
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.640]   to justify their position.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.800]   And as we saw with the Taylor Swift example,
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.360]   and as we're seeing now with other examples,
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.480]   they're just not doing it.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.560]   So, why do we need them?
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.080]   I mean, at the moment,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.120]   artists can reach their people directly,
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.400]   and labels have a role to do,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.440]   if they're willing to do it.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.640]   But at the moment, they just seem to be
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.800]   luring themselves into contracts.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.720]   - I mean, as I understand it,
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.800]   the labels are the one that cut that deal.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.160]   The labels are the one that cut the deal
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.400]   that the artists were built against.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.760]   They're the ones who were negotiated with Apple.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.960]   And so, they were sort of party too,
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.760]   that this sort of bum deal
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.320]   that a lot of artists were gonna get.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.720]   And so, yeah, I think they will be increasingly viewed.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.840]   They are increasingly viewed as an anachronism,
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.400]   something of a bygone era.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.080]   And also, the costs of getting things to market
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.600]   are so much less than they used to be.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.040]   The skills to be able to market things yourself,
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.040]   to be able to reach audience are so much less
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.120]   than the skills are so much more widespread.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.760]   So, it's a different world.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.480]   And labels, I think, large labels
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.960]   are certainly dinosaurs.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.040]   Smaller labels, I think, still have a shot
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.080]   for the artists that do just want,
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.600]   maybe to make music and need some help
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.840]   sort of doing it right and getting started.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.520]   They certainly can benefit from some catalysts
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.760]   to kind of teach them some shortcuts
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.360]   and get them to market and get them in the right places
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.360]   and book them to the right venues and that kind of thing.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.800]   But big labels, certainly,
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.240]   their days are numbered.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.240]   There's just no reason for them.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.160]   And in this case, they feel like they weren't sort of
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.840]   on the wrong side of the argument,
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.080]   not advocating on behalf of the artists
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.520]   that they should have been protecting.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.400]   They should have not cut the deal that did this
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.720]   and that artists had to step up and defend themselves.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.920]   - They're cutting their own throats
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.800]   by not really putting the artists first.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.080]   And meanwhile, Google jumps into the fray
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.680]   and Ian, you wrote a great article,
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.520]   I have to read this,
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.840]   "Google's new free music services, classic Google,
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.560]   "take someone's idea and slap ads on it."
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.320]   - Yeah, well, I mean, it's the way Google operates,
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.240]   it's the way a number of things operate.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.680]   And in a way, it's also the way Apple operates
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.400]   in that the people that actually create the music
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.680]   that people want to hear are getting done over badly
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.080]   by the whole system.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.520]   And Google is giving the stuff away
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.200]   and yes, they are paying their artists in the same way.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.920]   But the content creators that sell all this stuff
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.760]   are getting virtually nothing for it.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.240]   Whereas the people that provide the challenge
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.560]   to get it out there are trying to take all the money for it.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.400]   Now, Google's new streaming service, it's not bad.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.560]   You know, we look through it,
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.320]   there's an awful lot of slightly tacky music
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.680]   for want of a better phrase
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.600]   and it's all organized into the radio system
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.800]   and they can sell some nice ads around it.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.760]   But at the end of the day,
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.560]   it's just another streaming service
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.240]   and we'll see what Google actually come up with
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.680]   and whether or not they can convert people into paying for it.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.400]   But I think it depends an awful lot on how they do it
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.800]   and whether the advertising is too intrusive
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.520]   or not intrusive enough.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.040]   - Georgia, how do you get your music?
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.760]   - I just use iTunes and listen to the radio.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.640]   I am so old school.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.160]   So yeah, I want my own music.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.520]   I want to have the music that I want to listen to.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.400]   The problem with curated music is often,
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.120]   it's a whole bunch of songs that I don't want.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.360]   And with Google's free service,
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.440]   you can only skip six songs per hour,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.800]   which would probably be way underneath the amount of songs
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.160]   that I would need to skip.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   So I will be listening when the Apple music is launching.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.400]   I will take a peek at that and see.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.000]   But I'm not so sure I may just stick with iTunes
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.480]   and I just get my own songs.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.680]   I can play them as I want
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.000]   and I can make my own music less.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.400]   But I'm intrigued in having it be free
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.360]   and it's already set up on my phone.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.640]   I think that I'm going to take a listen
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.800]   and see if it's going to be different.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.880]   But ads I'm just done with
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.280]   and I need more skips than six.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.120]   So.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.720]   - I think for the average consumer,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.080]   I always try and think of it that way
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.240]   as a consumer reporter.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.480]   And there's so many confusing aspects
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.480]   of all these new streaming services
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.640]   and the Wild West that is really streaming right now.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.040]   One of which is,
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.440]   didn't Apple announce streaming a while ago?
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.800]   Didn't Google announce streaming a while?
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.360]   Why is this new as a consumer?
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.080]   I'm just trying to sort of be like, what?
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   - Yeah, true.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.800]   - Too much, too much change.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.400]   And they're all trying to differentiate themselves
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.240]   instead of just committing
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.240]   because they're trying to compete
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.480]   with Pandora and Spotify, right Jason?
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.560]   - Yeah, I mean, the devil's advocate position is that
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.600]   if Spotify and Pandora are easy to listen to, right?
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.720]   I don't have to manage my library.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.440]   I can put in some songs that I like
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.800]   and I can kind of quickly get more stuff like what I like.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.680]   I can make a playlist out of Spotify,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.080]   out of any music that I like,
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.160]   pretty easily, pretty quickly.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   And have 25, 50 songs and listen to that playlist a lot,
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.040]   which is kind of a behavior we know that people often do
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.160]   if they do like to manage their music.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.440]   Same thing Pandora, you can pick a few tracks you like
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.440]   or bands or albums and then just turn that into a station
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:01.240]   which is essentially like a curated playlist automated.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.080]   It's easy, right?
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.240]   I don't have to manage a library.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.920]   I still do, I'm sort of a tweener.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.160]   I kind of use all these things.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.880]   I try all of them.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.440]   I still have some music that I have on iTunes
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.080]   because, you know, they're CDs I ripped or things
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.400]   I bought on iTunes that are exclusive to iTunes
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.720]   or that kind of thing.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.440]   But more and more, I'm also a subscriber
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.160]   for the premium version, the 999 version of Spotify.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.120]   And I find myself increasingly listening to that
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.520]   'cause like something I can look up at, you know,
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.400]   a song that I hear and add it really quickly,
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.600]   you know, without having to decide,
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.760]   do I really want to buy that or not?
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.560]   And so I do think that, you know,
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.000]   Apple made the right move in doing Apple music
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.560]   because I think increasingly people will, you know,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.280]   the average consumer like you're talking about
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.280]   will find that it's much easier to do something like Spotify
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.640]   or Pandora and not have to manage a library.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.040]   One note about title though.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.080]   I tried title for the 30 day sub
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.200]   and I actually really liked the quality.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.680]   It made me remember what it was like to listen to CDs
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.360]   and I was like, wow, it really does sound good.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.480]   It makes me want to stop and not multitask.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.400]   Like I usually do when I'm listening to music
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.080]   and just like listen, you know,
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.560]   the way you used to like sit and listen to music.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.680]   And because I could hear so much of it,
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.120]   I could hear lyrics, you know, more fully,
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.720]   I could pick up, you know, harmonies
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.160]   that I didn't really pick up.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.600]   And I was like, oh yeah, you know, it really is good.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.960]   But what it made me do is actually,
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.160]   you know, maybe rip a few things that I really like
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.040]   in like Apple lossless or actually turn up
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.280]   the quality in Spotify.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.280]   And then I let my month run out on title.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.480]   But it did make me more aware of the fact that, you know,
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.360]   good streaming music does really sound better.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.280]   And there is kind of a noticeable difference
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.240]   in its worth to turn up the heat on the quality.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.960]   - I'm going to have to give that a listen
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.600]   because it's hard to imagine.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.720]   Once you kind of go to a compressed format, you forget,
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.320]   you know, you just, you forget.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.400]   And so, yeah, okay, put that on the to do list.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.880]   I think we've venerated Taylor Swift enough
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.300]   and we've delved into the streaming wars to the end.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.440]   Google news this week, kind of interesting.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.480]   An unofficial feature of Gmail,
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.400]   UndoSend is now official.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.040]   So, you know.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.880]   - GoldSend.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.280]   - Yeah, so, okay, the classic, I don't know,
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.720]   what do you guys think is the worst send failure?
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.440]   Like where you accidentally reply all,
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.520]   the wrong person on the header.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.760]   So like you have five people named Joe
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.840]   and you send it to the wrong Joe.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.320]   But that moment when you realize you've hit send
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.720]   and somehow in that millisecond,
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.520]   you realize that's going to the wrong person,
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.920]   the wrong people, the wrong group.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.840]   - Sending it to the wrong person is a big problem.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.600]   The reason I enabled this absolutely immediately
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.680]   is because I was responding to a reader
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.000]   about six weeks ago and I apologize to how in advance.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.320]   But he'd written a complaint.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.520]   I wrote a long answer back explaining
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.080]   why we did certain things.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.640]   And instead of putting regards at the bottom,
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.720]   I put retards.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   - It hit send and it was just like, oh no, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.360]   - So to fully clarify in the sense of this Gmail feature,
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.440]   you would have up to 30 seconds.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.160]   - I haven't set for 30 seconds.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   Yes, exactly.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.240]   - So it's cached, right?
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.360]   That's what's going on.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.960]   Meaning that all of your communications
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.240]   are then on a 30 second minimum delay.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.480]   - All the ones that you send, yes, I believe.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   - So if you're in one of those mad dashes on a deadline,
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.080]   it might come back to hurt you.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.760]   But in your particular instance,
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.600]   were you able to save this horrible gaff?
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.120]   - I wasn't, no, I had to send another email saying,
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.240]   I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.120]   That was entirely if I misspell check completely.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.520]   And I got a rather rude response back,
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.960]   which I really can't go into on a live show.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.600]   But honestly, when it comes--
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.160]   - You find a vast board in that case.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.640]   (laughing)
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.920]   - Well, I mean, I can live with a 30 second problem.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.760]   You know?
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.680]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.960]   - If it involves anything, sorry.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.400]   - I think that this is one of those wonderful things.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.080]   I always talk to all of my clients and friends
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.720]   about how if you're ever feeling anxious or upset,
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.000]   you should not write, text, or call anyone.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.360]   But on the phone, things are ephemeral and they go away.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.280]   And no one has proof of what you said
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.960]   or how angry or upset you might be.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.160]   But if you send an email when you're in the rash of the moment,
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.120]   or if you send a rash email about one person
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.040]   to the person you're talking about, I'm a stake,
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.240]   or add them in the reply all, it's a really horrible thing.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.720]   So this is, I think, a lifesaver for everyone.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.760]   If you had not already said yes to this,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.880]   access it, put it on immediately,
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.680]   because we are just creatures of habit,
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.480]   and so sometimes we're gonna make these horrible mistakes,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.280]   and then you pay the consequences for them.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.720]   So it's great, I love this feature.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   - Georgia, what are your top three sort of
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.920]   emotional intelligence tips for using technology
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.400]   as a therapist?
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.080]   - Okay, so why-- - What are we not doing
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.360]   that we should be doing for preserving relationships?
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.160]   - Exactly, one is turn your tech off.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.680]   It shouldn't be buzz, anything that you needed,
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.920]   it should just send small notifications.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.680]   We are way too attached to our technology,
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.080]   and I know this is a tech show,
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.560]   but we also need to have time to relax.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.600]   So I remember Renee Ritchie, who does Mac Break,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.640]   and he has like every single,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.920]   he has like a million computers,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.680]   and they'd all beep being at the same time,
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.000]   and I'm like, I have to leave, you have to turn these off,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.040]   because you're like a walking alarm clock,
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.760]   every few seconds, so-- - Okay, minimize notifications.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.640]   Got it? - To turn them off.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.440]   Two, don't use tech when you're really upset.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.080]   Don't send the email, don't send the technology, leave it,
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.280]   and then the third one would be don't use tech
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.680]   before you go to sleep.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.720]   It is the wrong shade of light,
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   and so you're gonna end up keeping yourself more awake,
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.680]   and the rapid flashing of the screen,
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.200]   as well as that instant gratification
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.760]   of reading things that are really interesting,
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.520]   are gonna keep you up for longer,
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.160]   and I know my husband's gonna be thinking,
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.280]   she does this all the time anyways, I break this roll,
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.720]   but if I really need to sleep,
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.560]   I turn off my tech, do some relaxing breathing,
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.000]   and then let myself go to sleep.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.040]   - Okay, so I'll go plants versus zombies,
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.120]   then relaxing breathing, then sleep.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.880]   - Exactly, okay.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.280]   All right, I think we've got it.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.480]   We are gonna take a quick break.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.160]   Luckily, Leo has gotten all the information
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.480]   about our amazing sponsors,
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.440]   and he will be sharing that with you now
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.960]   while we go and do our relaxing breathing.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.800]   - Our show today brought to you by Dropbox for Business.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.560]   We'll get right back to the panel in just a second,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.840]   but I wanted to tell you a little bit
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.000]   about Dropbox for Business,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.120]   which we are now using it to it.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.280]   We've been using Dropbox literally since Twit began, I think.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.800]   I think Dropbox might be a little younger,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.760]   so literally since Dropbox began.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.120]   I use Dropbox to share audio files,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.080]   to share text files.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.800]   As I wander around the studio,
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.400]   I noticed everybody else was using it too,
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.080]   but they were all using their personal account.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.640]   That's why we were really thrilled
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.400]   to find out about Dropbox for Business,
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.920]   and very glad to subscribe.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.280]   First of all, it's the right thing to do.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.360]   People are using their personal Dropbox for Business.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.800]   No, no, no, they need to use the Business account,
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.200]   but it's also really important
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.400]   because it gives you control
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.720]   in ways that you really, really want.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.440]   And the IT department will appreciate it,
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.360]   and if you're the IT department at your business,
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.120]   as I was for many years, you will appreciate it.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.400]   Dropbox for Business is already familiar to your employees.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.280]   It's exactly the same as they are already using,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.480]   but it has some real advantages.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.240]   First of all, every user starts off with a terabyte,
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.440]   and it's easy to expand.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.920]   That's awesome.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.320]   Your employees will love that.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.560]   Staff can collaborate with team members,
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.720]   securely invite and control access
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.160]   to outside partners and clients and vendors.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.120]   That's great.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.600]   They only see what you share with them nothing more.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.880]   And most importantly for your IT people,
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.800]   you get control.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.480]   Dropbox for Business has powerful admin controls,
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.600]   remote wipe.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.280]   Somebody leaves the company, don't worry.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.000]   You can wipe their account.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.360]   Intuitive sharing, permission controls,
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.840]   complete audit logs, you know who has access to data,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.040]   when this way IT can make sure only the right people
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.440]   get access to that sensitive company data.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.120]   Dropbox for Business also integrates
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.040]   with third party security and administration solutions
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.240]   like S-I-E-M and DLP and e-discovery
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.200]   that gives you even more control.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.120]   And of course, Dropbox for Business is secure.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.120]   It uses encryption for file data in transit and at rest plus.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.640]   And this is I think really great.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.160]   You know, the metadata also contains information.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.160]   They use segmentation and hashing
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.200]   and that anonymizes files,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.000]   makes it even more secure, more private.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.040]   They also have additional security features
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.720]   like single sign on and two step verification.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.480]   Of course, I always turn that on immediately
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.040]   and recommend you do the same two step verification.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:04.880]   You're gonna love it.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.800]   Take advantage of your employees familiarity
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.560]   with Dropbox, your familiarity.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.560]   We all, who doesn't love Dropbox?
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.160]   But give yourself the business controls you need.

[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.080]   Of this week in tech now, back to the news.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.800]   Leo on his honeymoon on a cruise somewhere in Europe.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.440]   Foolishly entrusting this ship to me, back to early.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.640]   Consumer reporter, consumer technology correspondent
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.480]   for ABC News.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.240]   So this week, important stories I was covering.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   I was testing tick repellents at a lab with 75 ticks
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.480]   crawling up my hands and legs.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.320]   - Hang on, thanks.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.680]   I supposed you to ticks willingly.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.760]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.560]   - I'm sorry you couldn't pay me to do your job.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.320]   I was just kidding.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.000]   - So I can't even work with the team.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.600]   - I know, we'll be talking about security bugs later,
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   but I just wanna let you know,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.800]   this is the context from which I come to this show this week.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.160]   So bear with me people.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.760]   - In a key, you are really hardcore, that's all I have to say.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.840]   I have so much respect for you after hearing that.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.680]   Rugby and tick repellent.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.000]   Hey, from the Jidjister champion, I'll take it.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.920]   - Please rugby, please rugby,
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.160]   lives through 75 ticks, crawling all over.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.960]   (laughing)
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.240]   - And you guys missed the big one,
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.520]   mother of twins, so I mean, come on.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.680]   - Awesome, that's the best way.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.360]   - That's really why I'm not on this show very often.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.600]   I can never get a sitter.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.360]   So, you know, this is my gift to Leo and Lisa,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.080]   was to host the show so that they could go on a honeymoon.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.760]   - So now you get, why, why, why in stereo?
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.400]   - Yes, see, yeah.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.640]   One story that really struck me this week,
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.960]   Google is working on a health tracking wristband,
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.920]   but it's not what you think.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.000]   It's not a Fitbit, it's not something
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.760]   that's gonna track your steps.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.080]   It's a research tool that will aid those
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:08.080]   doing clinical trials to get rigorous data of your pulse,
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.280]   your heart rhythm.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.200]   I don't really know the difference
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   between those two things.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.120]   And skin temperature, also environmental information,
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.140]   light exposure, noise levels.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.400]   You know, Google, pushing the envelope,
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.440]   you're an Android guy.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.040]   Would you trust, if they evolved this
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.960]   beyond clinical trials into something
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.640]   that reported data back to your doctor
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.840]   about how you were taking your medication
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.480]   or something in that vein, would you trust?
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.480]   - I would trust Google up to a point.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.720]   I would say there would have to be some significant benefit
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.520]   to me in order to wear it.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.680]   I mean, Apple is doing this with its smartwatch.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.280]   They're making a big thing about the med kit
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.760]   that they've got on that.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.720]   Google are now getting in on the game.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.560]   If they're just looking to add this into, you know,
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.280]   my smartwatch or whatever else, then no.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.080]   But if my doctor says, put one of these on,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.400]   we can monitor you 24/7 if you've got a serious condition,
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.480]   it may help improve your treatment.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.960]   Yeah, I'd be tempted to go along with that.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.040]   But at the same time, for general use,
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.920]   I can't see that this is something
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.680]   that anyone wants to get involved with.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.200]   That said, it does, these are also things
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.920]   are prone to false positives.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.160]   I have a friend who has to wear one
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.080]   'cause he works in the oil industry
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.960]   and he has to go through medical,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.400]   regular medical checks.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.520]   And so they put all this equipment on you
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.360]   and you forget that it's on there
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.560]   and then they got an alert
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.280]   because they were all watching a rather good film
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.680]   and everyone's heart rate wakes up
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.240]   and they were just like, okay,
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.120]   we need to find out what's going on on that front.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.840]   (laughs)
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.680]   So yes, it's an interesting prospect.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.800]   Would you wear one?
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.280]   I think, you know, we've seen so many tests.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.840]   I've done some, lots of people have done them
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.800]   where the deviation is anywhere from 10 to 25%
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.840]   in terms of accuracy around steps taken,
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.160]   miles, you know, miles run or walked.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.200]   So, you know, as with all this type of technology,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.760]   I think if you started by taking it with a grain of salt
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.440]   and then no pun intended,
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.560]   maybe it's tracking your blood pressure,
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.920]   but you know, then it goes up in terms of your,
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.800]   it's as its efficacy improves, then trust improves
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.440]   and it's sort of a hand in glove around that.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.640]   Similarly from Google this week,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.640]   they are testing new self-driving cars.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.920]   They've obviously been doing this for a long time.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.040]   These are really weird looking subsets
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.480]   of the Lexus cars they've been using.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.120]   They don't need steering wheels.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.880]   That's the design philosophy behind it,
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.200]   although they do have them at the moment
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.240]   for the road testing.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.480]   Right.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.840]   And while that was supposed to be the big news
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.760]   in self-driving cars this week,
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.960]   there's been a bit of a freakus about whether or not
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.360]   two self-driving cars had a close call.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.960]   So a Delphi executive was in one of their
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.040]   self-driving vehicles and he said that last week
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.560]   on San Antonio Road in Palo Alto that he was perfect,
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.680]   the car was preparing to change lanes
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.200]   and then he said they were cut off
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.040]   by a Google self-driving car.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.960]   So this sounded like, you know, self-driving car wars,
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.960]   but then a few days later,
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.240]   Delphi was forced to rescind the comment
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.640]   and said they were near each other.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.560]   - Yeah, we got pummeled by emails about this
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.960]   which had been covering the self-driving car thing a lot.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.880]   And it went from, you know,
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.040]   oh, nearly a mad max style mash up on the road to,
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.840]   actually they were a lane away
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.840]   and one just approached one slightly and that was it.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.240]   I don't know whether this is Delphi
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.640]   sort of trying to get the edge on Google
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.400]   and self-driving cars or whether it was just,
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.560]   it's just a great story.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.120]   The two self-driving cars crash into each other.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.000]   Who knows?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.040]   But yeah, I mean--
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.840]   - Like bumper cars without all the fun.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.840]   Like they only go 25 miles per hour.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.400]   It's not gonna be a fast-edged collision.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.960]   And in comparison to some of the drivers
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.080]   that we have in Quebec, it's probably much safer.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:56.920]   So--
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.240]   (laughing)
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.320]   - It was just so crazy.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.480]   - Go Jason.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.360]   - I was like, Google's is so crazy.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.120]   They're just like, they're a core business.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.600]   Those off so much cash,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.640]   the, you know, they're core advertising business.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.440]   That they're like the world's first public facing
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.720]   a research company.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.080]   You know, they have all these things that they're doing.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.440]   And that's not news.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   But it still amazes me every time
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.680]   that all of the diverse things that they're doing
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.440]   and all the things that they're trying.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.800]   And, you know, kudos to them for the things
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.640]   that they're doing.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.000]   There are challenges to a lot of these things.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.120]   I mean, a lot of the self-driving, you know,
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.520]   car division at Google,
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.120]   I mean, they basically gobbled up all of the world's best
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   researchers on this topic.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.360]   You know, this used to be a lot more collaborative
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.680]   when it was back, DARPA was running this
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.520]   and that kind of thing.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.440]   We've done some coverage on this.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.280]   Lindsay Gilpin, Tech Republic did a lot of coverage
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.480]   on the DARPA Robotics thing.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.960]   But one of the interesting insights was that, you know,
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   Google bought up a lot of the talent for that
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   and it really kind of dried up the research part of it
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.560]   because now, you know, it's all inside the,
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.920]   inside a private company.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.200]   So it's not public research with a lot of researchers
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.560]   sharing their knowledge and trying to help each other.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.240]   - But isn't that a benefit?
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.520]   I mean, at CES this year,
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.440]   it felt like it was the all autonomous car show
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.920]   with BMW debuting stuff, Mercedes jumping into the fray.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.640]   I was in the back of the BMW car and it was so,
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.880]   what really struck me about it
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.520]   is it was actually really not very disturbing.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.920]   There was no driver in the front.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.480]   Granted, we were, in this instance, going really, you know,
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.200]   no more than 10 miles an hour.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.800]   But it's amazing how fast you really adjust to that.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.080]   But the point was, is that you have all these engineers
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.360]   from all these other companies who are now taking this on.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.080]   And I think that's a benefit to the industry
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.520]   because you get original thinking around it
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.440]   from companies that are being forced to apply
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.960]   those same research techniques,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.480]   maybe not in the same, or at least research dollars,
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.600]   maybe not in the same volume,
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.920]   but at least they're all going at it now.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.400]   - I think that's an innovate.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.720]   - I mean, sorry, yeah, I would say it's a trade off, right?
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.320]   Like, because competition is spurs on innovation
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.880]   and all the companies are doing it
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.520]   and a lot of companies are trying to catch up with Google
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.580]   who has a bit of a lead here.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:27.160]   But at the same time, there are, you know,
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.040]   so it works both, it cuts both ways.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.520]   Like, there are things that they will duplicate
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.080]   and problems that they will, you know,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.920]   have to recreate the wheel on their own,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.280]   each in their own silos as they are competing with each other.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.520]   So, you know, it's one of these things that,
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.000]   yeah, it just cuts both ways.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.960]   It's a natural trade off.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.920]   - There's a couple of things though
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.840]   that Google really haven't thought out about this.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.920]   Firstly, from a legal standpoint,
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.920]   it's pretty clear that legislatures aren't going to allow
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.240]   people to just basically dial in their destination,
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.920]   go and sit in the back seat and have a pint
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.320]   while they're being driven to and from work.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.520]   So, I mean, if you've got to be sitting there
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.360]   ready to put your hands on the wheel and take control,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.480]   there's no real point to an autonomous car
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.640]   because you can't be doing other things.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.720]   And the second point on which nobody at Google
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.280]   has yet been able to answer is supposing this works.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.040]   Supposing the legend of the laws do get passed
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.600]   to allow this to work.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.400]   You've got a large section of private industry
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.160]   who now have no job.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.440]   There's no bus drivers, no lorry drivers, no taxi drivers.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.080]   What happens to those people?
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.560]   I mean, they're not all going to be able to retrain
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.680]   to be software engineers.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.560]   So, there needs to be some thinking about
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.400]   how we introduce this in such a way
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.720]   that doesn't cause mass disruption to the industry.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.560]   - Well, that's what really struck me about CES
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.400]   was that I noticed that the car companies
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.800]   had such a different approach and their main goal was to
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.240]   expose people to the idea of it
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   in very small manageable situation situations.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.200]   You know, it's like in this environment, you might do this.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.560]   And that's kind of what my takeaway was,
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.920]   is that from being in the Google car and realizing,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.080]   oh my gosh, I could look down at my phone
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.960]   for 10 seconds to figure out whether I'm taking a left
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.960]   or right and feel confident that I've got it
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.440]   on some sort of auto sensing.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.520]   You know, I don't know, do you guys have the auto sensing
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.800]   of a car stopped in front of you?
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.040]   I have that in my new minivan where if there's something
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.480]   in front of you that's slowed dramatically,
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.040]   it'll start beeping at me.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.400]   Within the first hour of driving the thing,
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.520]   it snapped my head up while I was looking for directions.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.840]   And I was so relieved and it was an amazing feature
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.040]   that I never even knew I needed or would be comfortable with.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.280]   I'm not saying I rely on it, but just those incremental things
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.840]   like lane assist and self-park,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.280]   I never used the self-park thing.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.360]   That just didn't seem like--
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.280]   - I could actually do with that
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.880]   'cause my parallel parking's awful.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.320]   - Well, you're used to doing it on the other side
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.160]   of the road, that's why.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.440]   - Well, this is true.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.800]   But when I came home from CES, I really had this feeling like
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.560]   I was disappointed that I wasn't coming home to a car
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.400]   that was gonna drive me home,
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.240]   because I'd been riding around a little bit
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.680]   enough to have had that experience.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.360]   And it was amazing how quickly, it was like,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.240]   when you got a Tivo for the first time,
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.480]   and then you had to go watch TV on
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.760]   where you didn't have a Tivo, it was just sort of like,
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.960]   what, this is crap.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.480]   I thought that would come in from CES,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.920]   I didn't drive myself home, this is ridiculous.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.160]   - Now, I think that this is wonderful.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.280]   I think that for people that have accessibility issues,
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.920]   people that are dealing with various physical disabilities,
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.560]   people that might be blind,
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.240]   people that are the elderly,
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.920]   this is gonna be a complete game changer.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.320]   And I think that, yes, it's gonna change
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   the complete infrastructure, but it's gonna do it
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.640]   at a very slow pace for people that trust it.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.840]   I think that for a lot of people,
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.520]   and I think Google might have to change their idea
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.440]   of not having a break and not having a steering wheel,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.960]   for those type of personalities that like to have control,
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.160]   they may wish if they want to,
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.560]   to be able to very quickly change the direction
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.760]   of where they're going in a heartbeat.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.040]   But I think that this is just a wonderful thing
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.680]   to be able to have for people that lose access
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.520]   to being able to drive,
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.600]   and then they no longer have their freedom
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.840]   of where they wanna go,
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.800]   and being able to go visit people
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.040]   that they want and their friends and socialize.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.280]   So, I'm really excited, I'm waiting for my,
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.400]   I'll take a flying car,
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.520]   so I'm really waiting for my self driving car.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.080]   - Oh, you are on it, you are on it, Georgia.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.760]   Hey, I'm gonna take a quick break, Jason,
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.960]   just because we are just,
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.920]   we're loquacious in Leo's absence,
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.360]   my gosh, I'm impressed, Leo on vacation,
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.640]   but he is here to share with us more information
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.680]   about the amazing sponsors of this week in tech.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.840]   - Hey, sorry to interrupt,
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.520]   but I wanted to mention,
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.680]   I know, I know, I know I'm not here right now.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.280]   This is my ghostly avatar telling you,
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.480]   back up, Z, I know, you knew I wouldn't let that go,
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.880]   wouldn't you?
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.240]   Carbonite online backup, not just for you,
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.560]   and you know, sometimes I think our audience maybe,
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.280]   it's important for them to know about carbonite,
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   'cause it's, you're the people your family goes to,
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.680]   your friends go to, your coworkers go to,
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.880]   asking for technical license,
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.120]   and I want you to remember to tell them,
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.440]   not only that they need to back up,
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.800]   but they need to do it right,
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.040]   they need to back up offsite,
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.000]   so that their assets are safe in the cloud,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.360]   and if something really bad happens in their business,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.320]   or their home like a fire or a theft,
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.000]   they don't have to worry, their data is safe.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.080]   More than one and a half million customers,
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.680]   70,000 businesses trust carbonite
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.800]   for round the clock protection of their business files.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.840]   It's so great, especially if you're supporting somebody else,
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.360]   I do this with my kids, they don't even need to know about it.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.920]   I just install it, you forget it,
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.960]   you could pay by the year or two years or three years even,
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.840]   and now they're safe, and you don't ever have to worry
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.800]   that they're gonna call and say,
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.960]   uh-oh, I just got bit by the crypto locker virus or something.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.120]   It's not a problem, they've got carbonite,
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.320]   and they love it when you say,

[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.520]   And Jason Heiner, welcome, Jason Heiner,
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.600]   editor-in-chief of Tech Republic
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.840]   and author of Follow the Geeks, follow thegeeksbooks.com.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.040]   Jason, thanks so much for joining us.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.440]   - A pleasure, a pleasure, wanna miss it.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.920]   - Following up on a story that's been kind of
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.280]   breaking over time, so Dick Costolo out as CEO of Twitter.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.400]   Twitter announces this week that they've hired
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.520]   search firm Spencer Stewart to help find the next CEO.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.720]   And they've said, "It will be a CEO who can devote
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.800]   his or her full time to Twitter.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.600]   Obviously, ruling out Jack Dorsey, interim CEO
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.160]   who's also CEO at Square."
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.080]   And I mean, I think what's,
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.080]   why I think this is interesting is what makes a company,
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.560]   what makes a CEO only able to focus on one thing.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.880]   I mean, you were just talking about Elon Musk,
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.080]   obviously SpaceX, Hyperloop, Tesla, SolarCity.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.640]   I mean, there are precedents, Steve Jobs at Pixar.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.520]   And well, I can't remember what his overlap was at Apple,
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.520]   but there was interest certainly and fingers in the pies.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.080]   - He was mostly at Apple.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:13.960]   Pixar was run by, Pixar had really good leaders running it.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.680]   His job at Pixar was pretty much to negotiate
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   with the studios and to say big things at meetings.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.960]   So when Steve came to Apple, he was all Apple.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.680]   Elon Musk is like an alien.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.440]   I don't know, that guy is unbelievable.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.960]   - But he's not the only example.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.520]   Carlos Gone is at Nissan and Renault,
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.080]   and he's co-CEO of two Fortune 500 companies.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.680]   So I mean, it's, but you just made a really good point,
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.880]   Jason, which is his job was to say really big things
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.160]   at meetings and who's gonna have a bigger stick
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.840]   to swing than Jack Dorsey when it comes to Twitter.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:53.800]   Maybe that's the wrong analogy.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.600]   - Well, I think what Wall Street really wants
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.080]   from a Twitter CEO is someone who can make it profitable
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.280]   because at the moment, it's still burning money
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.720]   left, right and center, and they can't seem to get over that.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.840]   And I think the old guard who would have been represented
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.160]   by Dorsey and the others, I don't think are in the,
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.280]   the mind space to actually get that right.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.200]   Well, they're looking at someone with a single-minded focus
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.720]   to actually turn this company around
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.760]   and make what is a very influential,
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.120]   very important company,
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.120]   something that shareholders can make money from.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.160]   And until that happens, I don't see how it's gonna work.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.680]   I mean, yes, there are CEOs who can juggle both.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.160]   And with the Steve Jobs and Pixar thing,
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.400]   Jobs is, as you say, it was,
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.880]   didn't negotiate with the studio and shout out at the staff
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.400]   saying, "Make it better."
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.120]   But I don't know, Twitter is,
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.720]   it's a very strange company.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.800]   I mean, you've had dealings with them as well.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.960]   They still seem locked into the startup mindset
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.120]   where it's all about getting in more buyers
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.800]   and not about making a profit.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.640]   It seems-- - Seems in,
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.080]   so much for you. - Thank you.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.240]   Go ahead, Jason. - Yeah.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.320]   I was gonna say, it needs somebody's full attention.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.400]   I think that's what they're saying.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.960]   And I think they're exactly right.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.080]   Twitter has some big issues to deal with.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.040]   You know, I still think,
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.760]   and I sort of tweeted this out last week of like,
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.960]   I still think of Twitter as more of a platform
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.800]   than a product.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.640]   And ultimately, that's kind of its biggest challenge.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.920]   It's never really become a product,
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.040]   but it has so much, it's raised so much money,
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.640]   and it is a public company now.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.760]   And so it has to show massive growth,
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.400]   and it has to show revenue,
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.600]   and it has to become a big business.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.600]   And I think it still feels more like a platform to me
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:37.520]   than a money machine sort of advertising product,
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.240]   which is what they'd like it to be.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.600]   That's not to say that it can't be that,
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.880]   but I think they need a different kind of leader
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.480]   to create that, if that's what they wanna become
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.120]   than what they've had in the past.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.200]   And that's not a knock against Jack or Dick Costolo,
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.000]   who's done some really good work,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.560]   I think may turn it into more of a grown up company.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.240]   But it needs something,
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.840]   it needs to do something different,
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.680]   if that's what it's gonna be.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.520]   And if it's gonna be something different,
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.280]   if it's gonna be more of a platform,
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.160]   then it needs somebody to sort of have the courage
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.280]   to take it in that direction
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.680]   and to sort of take a risk in that way,
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.480]   and see if it can do something different and powerful there.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.840]   But I don't see it as a job
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.360]   that anybody could do part-time,
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.360]   because it has such fundamental things to figure out
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.520]   about who it is and what it wants to be
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.720]   and what its business model is,
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.200]   'cause those things are still,
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.240]   those are just all on the table right now, I think.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.240]   - One of the things that--
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.600]   - Go ahead, Georgia.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.360]   - I think that Twitter gave that as the reason
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.560]   that they're gonna be looking for no CEO,
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.040]   but in the end, as long as someone makes Twitter profitable,
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.120]   they would be happy with it.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.640]   Whether they be part-time or not,
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.440]   they need someone that's gonna be able
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.800]   to really take a look into the inner workings
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.440]   of how Twitter goes through
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.360]   and how they can make a profit from that.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.040]   And if it would be someone that would be part-time,
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.440]   and if they were already starting to make money,
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.920]   I'm sure that he would still be the CEO
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.920]   and they would be keeping him.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.760]   So I think that that was the reason that they thought,
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.520]   you know what, maybe they're not spending enough time
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.360]   thinking about Twitter
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.760]   'cause they have other interesting ventures on their plate.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.360]   So let's try to find someone that can spend all their time
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.840]   trying to make sure that Twitter
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.600]   will be profitable coming forward.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.760]   - One of the stories that grabbed my attention this week,
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.600]   Ian, was Amazon filtering out bogus reviews.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.080]   And I wanted to ask you guys,
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.480]   what are your key indicators?
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.320]   Well, first of all, the story is that Amazon's AI lab
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   is going to bring in algorithmic software
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.560]   that's basically combing through the reviews,
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.520]   trying to figure out which ones are BS.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.960]   The estimates are somewhere between 10 and 20%
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:53.560]   of all reviews online are made up or written by someone
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.960]   who is not editorially--
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.960]   - It's an interesting--
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.960]   - Yeah, unbiased.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.880]   - The ones they can detect, yeah.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.560]   - Yeah, so what are your tips for figuring,
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.360]   what do you, what makes you think, hmm,
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.680]   that one's two on point, that's a fakey.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.880]   Like, what are your dead giveaways?
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.960]   - You've got to basically, you've got to look at
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.320]   who's doing the reviewing
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.800]   and what reviews they've done in the past.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.680]   That's a very good, I mean, with stuff like Yelp,
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.400]   for example, you can easily see,
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.160]   someone's got one review and one friend
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.760]   you instantly discount that review.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.160]   I think Amazon's got the kind of compute energy to do this,
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.640]   but they're also missing out on a rich vein of humor.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.360]   Since the mad, no, since the mad max--
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.480]   - I'm with you, Ian.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.280]   - Yeah, I'm sad, I'm like,
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.520]   I like some of the fake reviews are the best things
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.360]   about Amazon.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.320]   - Exactly, I mean, remember the mad max films
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.680]   just started, where they spray,
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.480]   the war boys spray their face with silver spray paint.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.840]   You can now buy on Amazon, sort of cakes silver spray paint.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.240]   And the top review there is, what a spray,
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.680]   what a lovely spray.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.520]   And you read that, you can't help laughing.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.120]   It makes the review so much better.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.920]   I mean, yes, obviously they want to take out
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.560]   the financially tainted reviews.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.240]   And people are just there to screw over
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.080]   the particular company involved.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.200]   But it all depends on how it's done.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.800]   And based on AI systems so far,
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.680]   I think they could lose more than they gain on this one.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.080]   - Well, I think what they said is it's gonna be
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.120]   if it's verified.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.480]   So they know that you bought the product from Amazon,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.280]   which is kind of something that you would think
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.400]   they would be doing already.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.560]   They have this red line,
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.880]   which I never noticed before covering this story this week
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.320]   that says verified purchase.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.400]   I never noticed that ever in all the reviews I've read.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.000]   So just push.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.680]   But that will be a part of the ranking.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.280]   Then they're gonna be allowed other readers to thumbs up
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.640]   or thumbs down the reviews.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.880]   That'll be part of it.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.520]   And then I'm just wondering if they're looking for keywords
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.960]   or if it's just going to be something that's,
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.200]   if it's totally over the top and effusive,
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.360]   then maybe it's a giveaway.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.800]   I don't know.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.640]   - Yeah.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.560]   - I was wondering the opposite too.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.600]   I wonder how many companies are going in there
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.960]   to their competitors and trying to spike their product
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.240]   by doing negative reviews.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.160]   Because I see plenty of that
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.920]   where a product will have,
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.360]   it'll have glowing reviews,
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.040]   like seven, eight, nine glowing reviews
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.040]   and one sort of really sort of non-descript negative review
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.320]   that's just like, I'm never buying this product again.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.040]   It didn't do what it promised.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.160]   And worst thing I ever bought.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.000]   And I'm just kind of like,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.800]   that sort of doesn't sound like anything.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.840]   - And I'm buying this product instead.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:26.680]   - Right.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.360]   - That too, yeah.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.200]   - Yeah.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.160]   - Well, I think you're right.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.960]   There's definitely, you know,
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.720]   I've always gone with the read the three, four and five.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.600]   The two, three and four stars.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.400]   You know, never read the five and the one.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.560]   But then I think I'm just so,
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.600]   I'm just so like swayed easily by positive things
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.400]   that I end up reading the fives and going,
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.960]   oh, it's going to be great.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.960]   - You see, I'm the opposite.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.640]   I, it's, the internet is made holiday planning
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.200]   an absolute nightmare.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.280]   Because you know, you decide where you're going to go.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.040]   You then you start reading the online reviews
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.440]   and it's just like, no, we can't go there.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.840]   The curtain's got a terrible review on that hotel.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:02.240]   - But one person's experience with a cockroach one time
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.320]   ruins this hotel.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.560]   I mean, I can't even imagine being a proprietor
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.720]   of any of these like little B&Bs or whatever.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.960]   They just get slagged off.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.160]   - But if you're in a large company,
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.840]   there are media companies who will explicitly say
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.640]   we will hire a whole bunch of people
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.400]   probably in the Far East or India
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   who will write good or bad reviews
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.760]   depending on what you offer.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.240]   And this kind of fake astroturfing of review sites,
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.720]   it's a serious problem.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.320]   If Amazon can get the AI right,
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.120]   this could be a really big help.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.120]   But, you know, to wear as human
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.000]   to really screw things up unique computers.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.360]   So.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.080]   - And also humans are still smarter than AI at this point.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   They figure out whatever Amazon does figure out,
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.960]   you know, humans will figure out a way to get around it.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.520]   Whether it's these companies that do this professionally,
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.440]   like you're saying Ian,
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.360]   they hire people to go and actually buy the product,
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.880]   be verified and then, you know, do the review.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.920]   And then whatever, within the 30 day, 29 days,
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.400]   they ship it back and, you know, get their refund.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.240]   I mean, humans are smart enough to get around it
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.080]   if they want.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.200]   And the Amazon system, I think,
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.480]   shows that because the Amazon reviews,
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.840]   just so much of it looks like fluff
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.680]   and doesn't look very real anymore.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   I think 10 to 20% is being very generous.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.280]   That's 10 to 20% that they can maybe
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.360]   of what they've detected.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.600]   I think it's a lot higher than that.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.760]   Amazon also weirdly announcing the Echo this week,
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.800]   which it's maybe,
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.760]   Jason, if you can play some of this video
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.040]   while we talk about it, it's kind of hard to explain it.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:39.040]   It's a cylindrical, what is it, like, eight inches tall,
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.400]   speaker with a microphone on it.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.480]   - That's gonna say also listener.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.040]   That's the seven micro phone.
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   - Right, yeah.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.760]   And it's supposed to be the hub for your home.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:52.200]   It's the controller for the internet of things,
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   all the nests and your hue lighting
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.800]   and all the things that you have
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.760]   that depend upon your phone right now.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:07.160]   And it's all gonna be controlled by speech.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.720]   And this strangely produced commercial,
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.680]   which is like attempting to be an episode
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:16.000]   of modern family and creep me out.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.800]   I mean, it's a great idea in a way,
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.480]   but it's gonna be always on listening.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.120]   It's got Siri-like functionality
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.560]   where you can ask it questions.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:25.000]   It can turn the lights on, turn the heat up.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   180 bucks, ships in July.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.800]   - And there's a lot of money into getting developers
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.000]   to develop interesting apps for this.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.760]   - Yeah, $100 million they're putting toward developers.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.760]   These people in this commercial
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.760]   are all right and fake reviews for that.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.080]   (all laughing)
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.000]   Look at 'em, look at 'em.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.200]   So the funny thing about the echo though,
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:51.040]   is that there are some people who've written
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.480]   really rave reviews about this.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.760]   People that I trust and that really know their stuff.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.640]   So James Kendrick from ZVNet
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   and Stacey Higginbotham of Fortune, formerly Gig Aome
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:08.400]   have written that I think James gave it like an A+,
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:12.120]   I think Stacey said, like if you're in the Amazon ecosystem,
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.600]   like it's kind of a must have,
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.440]   really kind of surprising, interesting stuff.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.800]   And some of the things that they said worked really well,
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.160]   I think Stacey talked about the fact that,
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.640]   she, it is connected to like her Phillips Hue light.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.040]   So she says, he's going upstairs.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.840]   She's like, turn off the living room lights,
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.520]   turn off the kitchen and then goes upstairs.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.040]   She's got all of her playlists and stuff on there.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.160]   So from her music uploaded to Amazon.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.920]   So it can play playlists, it can play albums,
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.760]   really easily.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.080]   And both of them have said, and others have said too,
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.160]   that with the seven microphone thing,
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.800]   the voice recognition is really good.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   It's very accurate.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.640]   Some of the most accurate that we've seen so far.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:04.040]   And we've all had, I think, an experienced, interesting
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.720]   anomalies of that disappointments
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.760]   over the past couple of years from Siri to Google Now.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.520]   And some of the things that those can and can't do.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.160]   So I'm interested in it from that perspective.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.440]   But remember, it is, so there is a security kind of implication
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:24.240]   and surveillance.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.000]   We had this long form piece on Tech Republic cover story
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.920]   last week on sort of the state of security and privacy
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.720]   and encryption and basically how to avoid a surveillance state.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.160]   And one of the things is just that there's this always
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.160]   on access that governments and even private institutions
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.520]   have almost everything that we do.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:46.720]   And with the internet and things,
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.320]   we're giving them more and more.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.960]   And so this is another case.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.760]   This thing is like your Android phone
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.160]   or many of the Android phones is always on.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.640]   It's always listening.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:00.320]   And it doesn't actually, it's not actually sending stuff
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.720]   to the cloud, it says, until that light goes on.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.680]   So you say, hey, Alexa or whatever,
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.560]   that's what this thing is called.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.840]   And then it's listening and then it's sort of interacting
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.680]   with the cloud.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.080]   But I don't know, it's still one of those things that,
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.480]   you know, you need to be careful of.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:19.560]   You need to think about the implications of it
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.320]   before you sort of jump into a product like this.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.840]   But there are people that are really
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.560]   have had good experiences with it.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.880]   - I think Vladimir Putin is looking at this device
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.360]   and thinking, my God, when the KGB days,
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.360]   we had to bug people.
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.240]   Now in America, they buy the bugs.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.080]   It's great.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.120]   - It is called Alexa.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:37.960]   - Yeah.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:38.800]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.360]   - I think we've just come up with a conspiracy.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.720]   - That's absolutely good.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.800]   - The couple of years, I think it was 2014,
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.360]   CNETs, one of CNET's best of show products was the Revolve,
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.720]   which was supposed to be this hub
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.320]   for all your internet of things, devices in your home.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.720]   And I have to say, this is a problem that needs a solution.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   Sort of like the, you know, the Harmony remote
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:02.240]   has solved the five remote issue in our house.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.120]   I'm the only person who can figure out
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:06.960]   how to turn on the Sonos, how to dim the lights,
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.000]   'cause we have the headlights,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.200]   and they don't work off the dimmer on the wall anymore.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.640]   Any of the we know switches that have timers,
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:17.360]   and you know, it's, God forbid that anybody's cold,
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.000]   'cause the nest goes on and off,
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.640]   and it's who's overriding it with what phone.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.840]   And so I see that this is a problem
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.240]   that is in search of a solution,
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.000]   not the opposite, which is so true of so many products these days.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.800]   - Yeah, I mean, we're still in very early days
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.720]   in the inside of things.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.120]   So I mean, we're still having worked out
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.280]   a coherent operating system where different devices
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.280]   can reliably talk to each other.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.480]   But I have to say, I read the echo reviews,
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.640]   I looked at it, I haven't actually tried the product myself,
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.280]   but when looking through the tech specs
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.120]   and what it can do and what it can't,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.680]   just for goodness sake, turn the bloody lights off yourself.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.360]   It's not that hard.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.240]   You know, we've been doing it for the last couple of hundred years.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.320]   I don't know, it's...
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.840]   - On the note of Angry British/Scottish Man venting,
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:58.320]   I'm gonna take a quick break
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.640]   because I know you have a big vent coming up.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.840]   Samsung, Samsung, Microsoft.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:03.680]   - Hold me back.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.920]   - I know, I on the other hand,
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.160]   I'm gonna have a love fest.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.080]   - It was down at Facebook
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.560]   and in their new Frank Gehry building and it was amazing.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.960]   So we're gonna take a quick break.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.760]   Leo's gonna tell you about one of the great sponsors
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.440]   for this week in tech.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.800]   - Sorry to interrupt, one more time.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.320]   I wanna mention Audible.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.680]   I don't have to mention Audible.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.360]   I know we're all Audible users here.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.640]   I loaded up the phone 'cause that's how I listen now
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.440]   with the Audible apps.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.360]   Those Audible apps are great.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.160]   I put it on both my Android and my iOS phone
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.120]   'cause I have a 12 hour plane trip to and from
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.280]   and I've got a lot of time watching the scenery
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.840]   float by on the boat and I wanna have my audio books.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.160]   So I have about a dozen.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:43.640]   I know that's overkill, but I love Audible.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.800]   Books that are ready to go.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.200]   I think I'm gonna listen to Alan first, F-U-R-S-T.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.440]   His book Night Soldiers is,
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.520]   he has a whole series of books about kind of spies
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.360]   in Germany.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.200]   It's right where I'm going.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:01.480]   I like to listen to books about where I am
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:04.080]   and so that's my Audible pick for the week
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.880]   but I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get you two books
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.800]   for free right now.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.120]   These are the, I should explain I guess Audible
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.040]   is the number one audio bookstore.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.280]   There's really no second.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.400]   This is it with a hundred and last time I counted
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.480]   I think more than 170,000 titles.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:24.720]   Not just fiction, nonfiction, science fiction.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.400]   They have the great courses, these incredible lectures.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.000]   So you can listen and learn.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.800]   They have speeches, comedy routines.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.240]   I mean, it's audio programming that fills your mind
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.680]   with great stuff.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.920]   Even some of our stuff is on Audible as a matter of fact.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.040]   So here's the deal.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:45.040]   If you go to audible.com/twit number two,
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.600]   audible.com/twit with the number two on it,
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   you're gonna be signing up for the platinum plan.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.840]   Now this is a really good offer.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:53.920]   This is the one I use.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:58.400]   You get two books a month for a low subscription fee.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.560]   You also get the daily digest of the New York Times
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:01.440]   the Wall Street Journal.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.160]   That's part of your subscription.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:07.440]   And that's free for the first 30 days.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.520]   So you can sign up for this at audible.com/twit.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:14.080]   You're gonna get to pick two books
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.440]   and I'll leave the rest, the other one to you.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.640]   I mean, there's so many good books.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.160]   Check out the first books though, F-U-R-S-T.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.880]   There's the new Stephen King.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:25.000]   That's awesome too.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.200]   And if you cancel the first 30 days, you pay nothing.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.520]   You get to keep those two books.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.480]   They're always gonna be good.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.680]   You can listen on your phone, in your car, at home,
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:36.160]   on your computer.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.280]   They now stream, which means you can listen
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:42.440]   on your Chromebook, which is awesome.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.840]   If you're lucky enough to have an Amazon Echo,
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.680]   you can listen on there.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.320]   I do that a lot now too.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:51.920]   Audible.com/twit and the number two,
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.960]   the offer is good in the US and Canada,
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.960]   but for all of our international listeners,
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.040]   you gotta check out what's available to Audible
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.880]   in your country 'cause it's so great.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.400]   Audible.com/twit and the number two.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.200]   Now back to this weekend tech, we go!
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.520]   - This week in tech it is.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.120]   I'm Becky Worley, filling in for Leo,
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.240]   who is on his honeymoon, cruising,
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.120]   maybe the Mediterranean, maybe someplace in Europe.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.280]   I don't know.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.600]   I am thrilled to be joined by Ian Thompson
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.520]   of the registered Georgia Dow of I'm More
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.920]   and Jason Heiner of Tech Republic
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.560]   and follow thegeeksbook.com.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.080]   This little portion of the show I am calling,
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.360]   what did you do this week, honey?
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.120]   It's like when my kids come home from school
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.400]   or camp right now and say, what did you do this week?
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.280]   Georgia, what did you do this week in terms of writing
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.760]   or anything that you were podcasting on
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.340]   that you felt was like, really got your attention?
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:52.080]   - I did a psychology article on the differences
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.040]   between Google Glass and Apple
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.920]   and the rest were just podcasts on different games
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.640]   that are coming out.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.920]   I did a fitness podcast on the psychology of fitness
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.200]   and how we can stay motivated
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.960]   and on how you can use different Fitbits
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.640]   and Apple watches in order to stay with it
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.520]   with keeping yourself active.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.440]   - I think quantifying in terms of fitness
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.640]   has been huge for people.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.200]   I mean, my dad's 78 years old, I just got him a Fitbit.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.880]   He is walking like a maniac.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.080]   He hasn't exercised in 15 years.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:27.200]   What were the major findings from how you think
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.920]   motivation is impacted by technology?
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.760]   - Well, I think that the wonderful thing is that
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.800]   it actually tracks for you when you're traveling,
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.400]   when you're doing something, and then you get to see it.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.800]   Plus, I love the fact that it gamifies
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.920]   being able to work out.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.720]   So now it's not that you're walking
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.960]   and you get nothing for it.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.440]   Though you're actually getting your health for it,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.440]   but most people just feel like, if I jog three minutes one way,
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.720]   I just have to jog back.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.520]   It just seems like a cost instead of a gain.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.360]   And I think that that's one of the wonderful things
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.840]   is that you can check your heart rate.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.440]   It makes it a little bit more fun.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.200]   You can change your music tracks to as you're going.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.200]   And so I love the fact that it can remind you
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.120]   to take your medication.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.600]   It can tell you what your heart rate is when you're going
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.680]   and you get to see your distance that you've covered,
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.080]   how much you're able to run further.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.440]   And we're not great with journaling things
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.920]   or writing down, which is good.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.880]   So this quantifies it for us.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.320]   And you can see fabulous graphs of, look,
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.280]   I've actually gotten better at this.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.840]   - My beef is that the ultimate fitness weight loss
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.640]   health gadget has not been invented yet.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.240]   And that is the gadget that scans what I'm eating
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.080]   and tells me exactly what the portion calories fat,
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.560]   nutritional info is, and then keeps that in my phone
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.360]   and reports back, okay, here's where you are on the day.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.280]   You can or can't have that piece of cake.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.360]   You're looking for the health--
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.000]   - Tung in plants.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.560]   - What do I need, Jason?
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.880]   - Tung in plants.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.880]   - Right.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880]   - The scanner.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.800]   - Cali.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.720]   - Hang on, I could British food at home.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.160]   I don't want to know what's in it
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.840]   and the number of calories that I'm taking in.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.680]   - I saw one.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.840]   I actually saw a similar to like a tricorder
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.640]   that would be able at CES that was able to actually tell you
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.000]   what medication you have just by the light that gets
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.320]   emitted back for it, the type of cheese
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   that you're eating in foods.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.440]   It can't deal as far with quantifying the amount
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.080]   to equal calories right now, but it was pretty close to it
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.240]   and relatively accurate.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.520]   So soon you will have your health tricorder.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.360]   - I remember that.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.800]   I remember 'cause I was trying to figure out
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.560]   how to say the word God forbid I ever had to say it on TV,
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.120]   a photo spectrometer and it was a handheld one.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.040]   And it was really interesting because they combined it
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.120]   with a scale.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.840]   And so by doing weight and then an analysis
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.400]   of the content of whatever it was,
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.520]   it could tell if it was a lipid or if it was a flower.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.200]   And it was all based on amazing science.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.360]   And I think there have been a couple of companies
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.240]   I've seen that have tried to say,
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.240]   "Oh yeah, we've got this.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.360]   Let's do a Kickstarter."
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.400]   Hello, vaporware.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.680]   Never happened.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.400]   But that's, we're on the same page, Georgia.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.760]   We want that to be happening.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.520]   - Jason, what was on your to-do list this week?
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.720]   What interested you?
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.520]   - Yeah, so I am, by the way, I was saying,
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.920]   just at the end of that last one was that,
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.360]   I swear you and I have talked about this on a podcast before.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.280]   And I think that's what it was.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.360]   There was a Kickstarter of this company
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.240]   that was doing the scanning this food.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.880]   And we were both like, "We need that.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.080]   We want that anyway."
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.120]   - Yeah, they have apps for it,
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.920]   but we wanted photo spectrometers plus app thing.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.920]   And we're gonna, we'll fund that when it happens, right?
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.160]   - Plug it in, plug it in, yes.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.240]   So that does bring you to an article that I wrote,
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.600]   an article in video I did this week that I published
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.280]   this past week on the only two reasons
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.080]   to buy an Apple Watch for now.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.680]   And one of them was better activity and health tracking
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.320]   and the other was notifications.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.200]   Those are the only two things it does like really well.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.960]   And better than most of the things that are out there
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.600]   that it is competing with.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.760]   Although I do like the notifications,
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.600]   the notifications for Google services,
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:17.600]   especially on Android, where I think are better
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.120]   if you're in the Google ecosystem, not surprisingly,
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.320]   but I think just the way that it handles notifications.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.640]   But for everything else in the iOS,
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.040]   because it has more apps plugging into the ecosystem,
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.320]   it has a lot more different types of notifications.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.480]   But the number one thing really is the better activity
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.240]   and health tracking.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.200]   So I talked about the fact that the glanceable notification
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.680]   of your sort of health status,
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.160]   the three metrics that Apple uses
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.360]   and the graphical display of that is really useful.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.600]   And actually one of the things that I talked about was
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:55.280]   you can use an app that the power of this is actually
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.360]   some of the work that Apple's done in the background
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.200]   with HealthKit and the Health app,
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.800]   which is the way most people know it on their phone.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.760]   And because it serves as sort of the hub
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.440]   of all that activity.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.920]   And one of the things that I mentioned in my story
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.680]   was the app lose it, which has this great database of food
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:20.120]   if you're tracking your nutrition, tracking your intake.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:24.120]   If that, you know, through that you can pull in stuff
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:29.120]   from other like Wi-Fi scales and your workout data
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.920]   and your activity data from your iPhone,
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.880]   and then it pulls it in.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.600]   So it tells you you've had this many calories today,
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.680]   here's how much you've done.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.360]   So either you can have that donut or you can't.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:44.360]   And that's pretty useful and it has a little iPhone app
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.440]   or Apple Watch app, I should say,
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.760]   that connects to the Apple Watch
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.440]   and sort of tells you what your sort of,
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.800]   how many calories you have left for the day.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.680]   - That's an endless, always have the donut.
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.520]   - It is.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.520]   - Always have the donut.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.360]   It's a good strategy.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.200]   - Yes.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.040]   - It's a good strategy.
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.840]   - But it's interesting point about notifications
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.840]   and about comparing it to other fitness devices
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.080]   because I've always said that the limitation, obviously,
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.120]   with the Apple Watch is IO,
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.040]   how are you gonna input any of your data
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.280]   and what's the output in terms of the display?
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:16.800]   But what is that small postage stamp beat
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.760]   in terms of screen size and input output mechanism?
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.080]   Your Fitbit, which sucks.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.760]   You got like three little things
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.720]   that are doing some cryptic buzzing
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.880]   and like a sequence of SOS messages
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.040]   and I'm trying to figure out,
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.280]   does that mean that I did my 10,000 steps
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.720]   or that I'm woefully behind?
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.880]   So in terms of IO, I hadn't thought about it
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.280]   that it's definitely gonna beat those devices.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.880]   - It's apparently quite awkward now to go
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.080]   for a business meeting at Apple
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.520]   because their watch beeps after 55 minutes
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.960]   and says you should stand up and do a bit
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.160]   of jumping around now.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.360]   - And everyone stands up.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.720]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.600]   - Leo stands up during the show,
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.160]   when it's in the middle during live.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.160]   (both laughing)
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.320]   - You know, I was his producer
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.440]   when we first started at Tech2V a hundred years ago.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.080]   And while other people were doing their segments,
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.520]   he was on all these fitness kicks.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.400]   So somebody, Martin Sargent or somebody
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.320]   would be doing a segment and he'd be jogging.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.440]   And once he stripped down and took his shirt off
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.920]   and streaked behind the set
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.280]   while someone else was doing their piece.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.440]   So now Becky, what did you tell him?
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.240]   Did you, were you like, stop or were you like,
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.080]   go for it Leo?
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.280]   - You know, it's, we were so desperate for ratings.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:32.320]   I was out of my, we might rub off that behavior
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.040]   on some of the other talent also.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:34.880]   - Right.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.720]   (both laughing)
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.560]   - Right.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.120]   I think that one of the,
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.200]   I think one of the best things with the Apple Watch
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.560]   is just the change in social interactions.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.520]   So I'm sure that everyone on the panel
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.080]   has been to a tech conference
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.520]   and everyone's on their phone,
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.320]   whether they're eating, whether they're sitting next to you.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.040]   - I'll be no thanks for that.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:53.880]   - Right.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   (both laughing)
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.720]   Oh, that's so bad.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.720]   Don't do that.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.080]   Put away the tech if you're on a date.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.960]   But that's a wonderful thing is that you can just,
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.160]   you know, know if it's something
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.360]   that's important or not,
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.360]   and you don't have to be glued constantly to your phone,
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.960]   there's actually someone next to you,
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.760]   look at them and converse.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.360]   That's what you're supposed to be doing.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.200]   - But as someone who...
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.040]   - That's my favorite thing.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.720]   - But as someone who's concentrating so much
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.240]   or who's such a specialist in terms of how this
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.920]   is handled socially,
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.120]   this seems to be a fundamental problem with smartwatches
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.000]   that people can't get around.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.320]   You get a notification, your watch buzzes,
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.480]   and your first indication is to look at it.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.400]   It's just an instinctive reaction.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.040]   And if you're in a conversation with somebody
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.720]   and you're looking at your watch, it's incredibly rude.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.880]   So I mean, how do you actually get around that?
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.720]   - Actually, that's even a worse social prompt,
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.320]   which says, it's not, oh, I just got a notification.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.360]   My babysitter might be calling to say the house is on fire.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.880]   It's more like, oh God, I've got to get out of here.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.680]   This is just going on and on and on.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.440]   That's the social cue you're sending.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.880]   - Yeah, the social cue is your boring, right?
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880]   - Yeah.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.560]   This was the other article you did, right, Georgia?
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.640]   - Yeah, I think that, well,
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.200]   the other article was on the problems with Google Glass
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.880]   in comparison to moving tech from the face
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.440]   and onto the rest, which, you know,
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.560]   there was just a whole bunch of issues with Google Glass.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.160]   Some funny, some not so funny, but you were always,
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.840]   I was all, if anyone even looked,
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.320]   so when you really think about something
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.240]   that's either in the past or thinking of something
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.440]   that you want to say in the future,
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.120]   you often look up into the side.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.320]   And whenever that would happen,
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.240]   when I was talking to someone that was wearing Google Glass,
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.160]   I'd be like, are they like surfing the web or checking me?
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   Like, what are they doing?
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.120]   Are they doing something else than being in the conversation?
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.000]   And so I think that it's better being on your wrist
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.720]   because it's outside of the social scape of where we actually
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.280]   have neurons that fire just for faces.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.360]   That's how important facial interaction is for us.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.400]   And so that's why I think that it's better
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.040]   to have it on your wrist, but no, don't look, just wait.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.920]   Nothing is so important than weights.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.920]   And if you can't wait, turn off the fact that it,
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.760]   you know, taps you, just turn that off.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.320]   And then when you're ready,
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.160]   you're not supposed to be a slave to your tech.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.720]   Your tech is supposed to be there to make your life better.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.800]   So if it's an emergency, they'll call.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.480]   If it's not an emergency,
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.560]   then you can wait to be able to interact with it after.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.440]   - Georgia spent the week writing about how technology
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.200]   is annoying.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.400]   And Ian, you spent some of the week writing
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.320]   about how Samsung is annoying if you're a Windows owner.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.920]   - Yes, this was the big wanker moment of the story
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.520]   in the office.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.600]   - So keep brief, Meg.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.440]   - Okay.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.680]   - Give me the whole setup.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.000]   - Basically, a bunch of computers, a bunch of researchers
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.200]   found that Windows update, which automatically updates you PC
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.800]   with security and driver information,
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.760]   was getting knocked off with Apple systems.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.680]   It was being automatically shut down.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.880]   And they found that Samsung's firmware had introduced
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.760]   an executable file called disabled Windows update.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.480]   They actually named it, disabled Windows update.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.560]   - Not a subtle.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.200]   - Which would basically cut off Windows update
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.880]   so that Samsung had control of the drivers
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.640]   and its own device, but also disabled all the security
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.480]   patching that went on as well.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.360]   And it's not only that an engineer did this,
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.600]   but his manager looked at that and thought,
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.200]   hmm, that's a really good idea.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.040]   This guy should be strong up by his goonies.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.880]   I mean, it just, it boggles the mind
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.000]   that somebody could be that dumb.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.840]   And they've now retracted and they've said,
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.520]   will this show a software patch to make this right?
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.800]   But who thought of this and why?
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.360]   - How does that, I mean, what do you think
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.280]   the impact of something like that is on the relations
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.560]   between Samsung and Microsoft going forward?
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.480]   I mean, is this something you can lay off on one engineer?
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.800]   - Well, I mean, it was something that
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.360]   we got a statement from Samsung saying,
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.240]   but we're gonna fix it.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.520]   We asked Microsoft for a statement
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.240]   and they're usually very good at getting back to us
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.360]   and we didn't get a thing, which means
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.280]   I think lawyers have been arm-twisting with Samsung
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.040]   quite considerably saying,
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.200]   "If you want to carry our software in the future,
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.720]   "you might want to fix this now."
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.760]   But, you know, Microsoft is not gonna accept this
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.480]   because Windows 10 is coming down the line in July
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:59.120]   and Windows 10 relies on automatic updates
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.720]   for consumers at least, you don't get a choice.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.000]   They automatically push down to you when they're ready.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.320]   If you're a business customer, you can choose when you get it.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.440]   So fixing something like this is absolutely key
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.000]   to Microsoft going forward.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.720]   - My this week in my week was going to Facebook.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:20.360]   Went down to their new building down in Palo Alto
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.200]   and really interesting.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.440]   So it's a, they have 10,000 employees at Facebook
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.480]   and they have a campus that's right at the end
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.880]   of the Dunbarton Bridge on the Silicon Valley side
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.040]   or the peninsula side of San Francisco Bay.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.800]   And they've now built their 20th building across the street
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.080]   and it was designed by Frank Gehry
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.800]   who designed the EMP Paul Allen Music Experience
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.440]   up in Seattle, that weird wavy looking thing,
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.560]   you know, with all the rock museum inside,
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.360]   right at the base of the, well,
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.840]   sorry, used to work with the whole thing in Seattle.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.680]   - The Skarnetl?
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:02.360]   - Yeah, the Space Needles, that's it, Frank Ford.
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.720]   So, but so he designed this building
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:10.720]   and really interesting because the dictate from Facebook
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.160]   and Mark Zuckerberg was that they wanted it
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.840]   to look unfinished inside.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.480]   So it's this long building, it's a quarter of a mile
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.840]   from end to end.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.680]   Inside has the trademark weird graffiti art
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:30.120]   and there's not a single office in the entire building.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:33.800]   There are conference rooms and some people, you know,
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.560]   my HR department might reserve an entire conference room
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.640]   for all the hirings and firing, so whatever.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.800]   But even Cheryl and Mark sit in an open desk plan
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.160]   in the building, the weird thing to me,
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.000]   and they won't let you photograph inside
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.480]   the workspace, they do all the exterior areas.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.600]   Right there is the rooftop garden,
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.200]   I think that's the roof.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.680]   So if you walk the path on the rooftop garden,
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.120]   it's a half mile loop, just walking on the roof.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.880]   And the sort of the walking meeting thing
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.360]   that was really big, Steve Jobs does it,
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.840]   did it, Mark Zuckerberg does it.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.720]   That's really popular there.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.760]   Gotta keep our Fitbits and our Apple watches logging our steps.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.360]   But inside, this is the part that I don't quite get.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.320]   So there are these tubes hanging down,
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:24.320]   the ceilings are, I don't know, 40 feet high in the building.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.240]   It looks completely unfinished, open beam,
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.200]   all the heating and ventilation ducts are exposed.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:36.200]   And then hanging down every cluster of tables
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:41.680]   is this like big bulky thing of cat five cable
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.960]   and must be also power.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.600]   And I can't figure out why they didn't put it in the floor
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.440]   of the building.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.320]   So as you're looking at this amazing open space,
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.160]   it's just littered with what looks almost like,
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.400]   I don't know, IVs for the people on their computers,
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.760]   but it's such a weird take on the modern office space.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.600]   - Well maybe they're trying to get back to that feel
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.400]   of being a startup and literally having
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.080]   sort of cat five cable running from the ceiling
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.480]   'cause they had nowhere else to put it
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.240]   and get back to that raw feeling that,
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.720]   this isn't a very expensive building
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.760]   that we had designed for us,
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.560]   but yes, this is back to the good old days
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560]   when we were making our way
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.600]   and getting everyone fired up that way.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.160]   But I do like the idea of a walking garden on top.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.120]   That could be rather nice.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.480]   - Hell, well I love that.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.320]   - Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.440]   - That it's open for everyone.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.440]   So that makes it accessible to everyone.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.400]   If you have a question,
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.640]   you don't have to worry about interrupting someone
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.680]   inside of their office.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.960]   You're always open to that.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.200]   Not great for your stress levels as well though,
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.720]   because you can never have any privacy
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.600]   if you need a moment.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.360]   Someone's always watching you,
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.360]   which so there is a little bit of a detraction
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:48.200]   and having an open concept for your office building.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.880]   But no, I'm curious with you, Becky.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.240]   I'm like, it's, I don't know,
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.360]   those good old days weren't that good old days.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.480]   You wanna have the wires on the floor really.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.040]   Like you can afford it now,
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.560]   have them popping up under the floor
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.880]   and then become seamless when you don't need them.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.280]   So you can put them away.
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.200]   They could have shelled out for a little bit, I think.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.560]   - It does also seem a little bit like that vestige
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.640]   of all the graffiti art inside of it.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:12.280]   I remember the first time I went to their new headquarters
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:13.800]   when they moved off University Avenue
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.120]   and they went to this, the building buildings one through 19
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.200]   on the other side of the street from this new one.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.000]   And there were these weird graffiti art elements on the wall.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.360]   And it was mostly otherwise a pretty standard office park
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.200]   type building.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.800]   And when I saw that episode of Silicon Valley
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.640]   where Ehrlich hired the guy to make the graffiti logo
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.960]   and it went horribly wrong.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.240]   It totally reminded me of Facebook like,
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.400]   "Oh, we have similar."
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.640]   It does remind me there,
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.280]   some of these are really common trends
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.760]   with I think architects in the Bay Area
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.560]   'cause we have something very similar with the cables
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.600]   in the CBSI formerly CNET headquarters
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.280]   on Second Street in San Francisco.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.600]   And we also have the graffiti too, except ours is chalk.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.320]   We have, it's these giant chalkboards
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.760]   and there's graffiti with a lot of the different logos
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:10.720]   and brands sort of do their own, have done their own thing
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.600]   or I think maybe even chalk artists did some of it.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.480]   But the weird thing is that cable thing
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.240]   is we're trying to get rid of it now
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.160]   because it just sort of gets annoying and looks unfinished
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.760]   and you're like, people come in and they're like,
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.200]   "Why are the cables open like that?
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.800]   "That seems so odd."
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.800]   - Dude, we were trying to make a statement.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.360]   We're young, we're hip, we're happening.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.960]   We have ethernet hanging everywhere.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.840]   - What is it about ethernet?
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.480]   - Exposed ethernet cables that make you look hip.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.440]   I mean, everybody's wireless anyway.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.920]   So it's kind of like, wow man.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.240]   - It's nostalgia, come on.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.400]   You know, the good old days where you feed the cables
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.040]   through the ceiling panels and down
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.000]   and sell and take them to the concrete pillars
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.760]   just to get one to your computer.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.640]   It gets a little bit of energy going in there, but it's--
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.880]   - They could just hang AOL disks around
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.960]   and you'll get the same nostalgia.
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.600]   On that note, I am gonna take a break
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.880]   and we are coming back to discuss the exciting, the thrilling.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.880]   The thing that really gets me excited,
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.800]   battery technology.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.200]   Stay tuned for that.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.240]   - Hey, before you wrap the show up,
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.480]   can I get one more word in edge wise for our great sponsors?
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.080]   They make to it possible.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.360]   We're very grateful to them and one of our newest sponsors,
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:27.360]   not only on Twitch, but on the whole network is Credit Karma.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.200]   Man, I love Credit Karma.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.600]   I actually have found out about it a long time ago
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.880]   'cause I heard two of our employees talking about it
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.400]   and one of them told the other one,
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.480]   "You gotta try this," and I, of course, listening in.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.560]   I said, "Ah, and I went off and tried it and I love it."
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.040]   It's free.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.200]   You can't beat that.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.520]   Credit Karma.com.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.640]   When you go there, you're gonna learn
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.120]   about the most important number in your life.
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.680]   Not your age, not your weight, not your IQ.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:53.520]   Those are important.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.360]   This is more important.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.120]   This is everything to do with your financial future.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.040]   It's your credit score.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.400]   That's gonna impact what you pay when you get alone,
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.560]   whether you can get a credit card,
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.080]   whether you can buy a house.
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.240]   You need to manage that number.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.720]   You need to keep an eye on it.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.800]   It's good when it goes up, bad when it goes down,
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.760]   and you wanna be notified when it goes down,
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:15.320]   figure out why Credit Karma will help you with that
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.160]   and fix it.
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.000]   People often get stuck paying for this information,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.960]   but never with Credit Karma.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.240]   Free credit scores, reports, monitoring,
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.480]   handy financial tools to help you make sense of your credit
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.080]   to understand why your score is the way it is.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:34.920]   It was a boon for me, really helped me when I was buying a house
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.680]   to know, and frankly, I had a problem.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.520]   My score was lower than it ought to be,
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.440]   and thanks to the information I got from Credit Karma,
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.640]   I was able to call a credit card company and say,
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.360]   "Hey, let me pay that off and get rid of it,"
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.480]   and that made a big difference.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:51.640]   So get the Credit Karma app by going to your phone now
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.280]   and texting, you can do it right now while I'm talking.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.200]   I won't mind.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:00.200]   Twit to 89800, 89800,
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.440]   and you'll send your link back with the app for your phone,
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.880]   the right one.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.760]   You'll also get suggestions to help you manage
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.680]   and monitor your credit.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.400]   You'll be alerted when your credit score changes
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.760]   and you do not have to give them a credit card.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.920]   It's free, creditkarma.com.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.880]   Manager and monitor your credit for free
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.880]   with no credit card required.
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:22.280]   Do get the app.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.000]   It's good because then you get the notification
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.720]   if your score changes.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.280]   You could celebrate when it goes up.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:33.280]   Creditkarma.com, make sure you text Twit to 89800.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.880]   That way you can monitor your credit on the go.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.240]   Speaking of going, let's get back to the panel
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.600]   on this weekend tech.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.480]   Thanks guys.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.400]   Previously on Twit.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.640]   If we look at this here, you'll be really surprised
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:51.640]   that this is 1599 because you're used to seeing this be 82.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.240]   - Is that a sleet flicker or are they doing the nickel offense
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.080]   there?
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:55.920]   - Is that what you're gonna see here?
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.160]   Is it gonna have these regular's in the room?
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.520]   - Coding 101.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.240]   You've actually got a very nice starting item here
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.960]   and that is some good practices for people
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.360]   who wanna teach themselves to code.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.200]   - I'm believing yourself.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.120]   Like that would be one of them.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.120]   - Believe that you could figure out
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.480]   how to do what you wanna do.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.840]   You think to yourself, okay, I have no idea how to do it now
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.720]   but if I sit down, I will eventually figure it out.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.320]   - The new screen savers.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.120]   - Really excited to be talking to Adam Nimoy.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.000]   You Leonard Nimoy's son.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.760]   - Gene Rondere actually told that that he was the conscience
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.600]   and Star Trek because a lot of the work
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.800]   that he had done, a lot of the social and political activism
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.720]   he had done even after the series was over.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.600]   The fact that he wanted to save the whales
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.960]   was the message from Star Trek 4.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.320]   - Tech news tonight.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.800]   - Wired reports that a company has developed an algorithm
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.240]   that finds out who's naked on the internet.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.040]   The app is intended to automate the task
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.920]   of determining whether a website is family friendly or not.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.800]   Wired says the technology is lucrative
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.120]   because even though the mantra sex sells is still true,
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.000]   it's also now true that keeping it away
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.040]   from the kitties sells also.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.400]   - Twit, hashtag pants check.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.640]   - Coming up this week, Apple launches this long-awaited
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.040]   Apple Music Streaming Service Tuesday, June 30th.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.760]   Also, Apple's Beats One worldwide radio station
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.520]   will also launch Tuesday at 9am Pacific.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.560]   Two major Chinese flagship smartphones launched Tuesday,
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.880]   Mase's MX5 and the Huawei Honor 7
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.040]   will both be released that day.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.000]   Tuesday also gets an extra second.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.040]   A leap second will be added
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.640]   to the network time protocol to keep time synchronized
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.840]   with the slowly lengthening solar day.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.920]   Some organizations will add an extra second
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.800]   at the end of the day, but Google uses something
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.400]   called the Google smear, which adds pieces
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.800]   of that extra second throughout the day.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.760]   Needless to say, internet's clocks
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.040]   will not be synchronized on Tuesday.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.280]   And Microsoft's giant tablet for conference rooms
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.360]   called the Surface Hub becomes available for pre-order
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.720]   on Wednesday, July 1st.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.640]   Back to you, Becky.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.760]   - Everything you ever wanted to know about the Twit Network,
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.880]   I'm Becky Worley, Phil and Infer Leo Laport,
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.440]   and joined by amazing guests in studio and in Skype,
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:03.000]   and we now move on to my pet subject of the week.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.280]   An article that really grabbed my attention
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.600]   'cause I'm fascinated by batteries.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.520]   This was from Quartz.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.800]   It was a really interesting article
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.560]   about this guy, Yet Ming Chang,
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:14.760]   a Taiwanese guy who went to MIT,
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:17.720]   and he's done a bunch of battery startups,
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.440]   a new technology, trying to really innovate
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:24.480]   the process of what the recipe is
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.200]   that goes into the battery slurry, if you will.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:31.320]   And he's now started a new company,
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.800]   and he's changed his approach completely,
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.640]   saying, "We're not going to move
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.240]   the battery process forward in the lab,
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.240]   we're going to move it forward on the assembly line
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:45.560]   and in the factories as we make batteries."
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.640]   Ian, you're skeptical about this
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.520]   just because we've seen so many battery stories
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.120]   about the next innovation,
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.160]   the thing that's going to take lithium-ion forward,
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.080]   we're going to get to the moon,
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.800]   we're going to have, we're going to replace fossil fuels,
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.000]   it's all batteries.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.040]   No, I mean, I am a little bit skeptical,
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.040]   because I've already burnt so many times
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.320]   over the last 10 years.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.840]   But what interested me about this was,
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.400]   there's a historical analogy to this,
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.280]   which works quite well.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.600]   When mankind moved from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age,
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.760]   it was a very slow process
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:17.320]   because iron doesn't offer that many advantages over bronze.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.400]   But if you chuck carbon into the mixture
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.960]   in the manufacturing process,
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:24.160]   you get steel, which instantly does brass
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.560]   in pretty much every bronze,
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.040]   in pretty much every other way.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.400]   So taking it from the manufacturing standpoint,
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.840]   I think, is quite handy.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.280]   It all depends on rollout,
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.280]   because as I say, I've written so many stories about,
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.840]   this is going to be the next big thing,
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.840]   lithium-ion, lithium-polymer, whatever.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.520]   I hope, I really hope,
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.360]   because we need battery technology like nothing else.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.920]   So if you can encapsulate,
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.440]   I mean, just to sort of put this in perspective,
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:54.600]   batteries are basically equivalent to gasoline.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.840]   It's a storage mechanism for energy.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.840]   And why, I think we've all heard the smoothing out,
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.480]   the grid argument,
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.680]   and that we need to be able to do this
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:07.240]   at sort of industrial scale.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:11.680]   Then we've got the Tesla battery for the home,
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:14.840]   batteries for cars, batteries for space exploration.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:18.000]   What is it that makes batteries the catalyst
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.840]   for moving us into the next age?
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.840]   Or is that an overstatement?
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.080]   - Actually, I don't think it is.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.120]   It's technology like this,
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.840]   which is going to get us to Mars and beyond.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.240]   It's the ability to store large amounts of power
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.560]   for long periods of time in a format
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.920]   which people can use relatively easily.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.600]   We've lived in the electricity age for over 100 years now,
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.920]   and we still haven't cracked this one.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.160]   It's basically taking all the wonderful devices
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.120]   that we can build,
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.080]   and being able to power them from a simple,
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.840]   easy to use, cheap, and powerful unit.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.400]   And if you can get that cracked,
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.960]   then an awful lot of technologies will just explode.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.960]   I mean, we've been willing to accept with smartphones
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.240]   that we only get a day-long battery life out of them,
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.640]   whereas my old Nokia used to do a week.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.520]   You know, taking that forward,
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:07.680]   if there's so many technologies that could be developed
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.560]   if you got a large reliable power supply,
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.120]   and it's very exciting.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:15.880]   I would like to see something in the way of a finished product
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.200]   before I go total fanboy on it,
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.480]   but it does look rather good.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.920]   - So the idea here is that this is sort of innovation
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.200]   on the factory floor, sort of the Kaizen model
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.040]   that Toyota did when they just said,
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.600]   one thing better every day,
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.200]   let's get the manufacturing process.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.880]   That's the place that this is asserting
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.480]   we can make the biggest impact.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.640]   And I mean, some make the argument with batteries.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.640]   Okay, let's say Moore's Law,
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.560]   doubling your processing power every 18 months.
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.840]   With batteries, we're looking at a 6% increase
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.480]   on capacity over a year.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.560]   That's what it's been historically
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.000]   in recent history with lithium ion.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.640]   And that's just not that impressive, some would say,
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.920]   what's it gonna take?
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:03.640]   - Well, I mean, some means, oh, sorry, Jason.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.560]   - Yeah, I was just gonna say,
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.400]   I think that I'm skeptical as well from the same point of the
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.400]   design is that I've covered a lot of these things.
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.680]   And there've been so many promises about
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.480]   what it can do and will do.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:17.520]   And so I think that we do run up against the limits of
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:20.200]   physics and chemistry and ultimately science.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:25.200]   And so possibly the more promising direction
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.600]   is the fast charging.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.600]   So that is something that has made hugely forward
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.360]   and continues to, to where you can get almost
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.920]   a full battery charged in now, less than an hour.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.880]   Same thing with cars.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.520]   You can get Teslas, the newest Teslas charge
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:50.520]   much, much faster in 20 minutes.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:53.040]   I think you can get a lot more mileage
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.640]   from one of their charging stations.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:58.000]   It's the same process.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.720]   And then the other thing is also from a design standpoint,
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:06.600]   the design designers in the technology space,
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:10.880]   understanding the limits of battery are now being
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.880]   a lot more disciplined and a lot more focused
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.560]   in the way they design their products
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.440]   so that they don't use as much power.
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:21.880]   So they aren't sloppy in the ways that they are
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.200]   just sucking as much power as they possibly can.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.680]   And that goes a long way.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:30.680]   And that has sort of made big leaps forward in recent years.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.880]   And I think there's still a headroom for that
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.200]   to get better and stronger.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.480]   And as we, as these devices use less power
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:42.560]   by being more efficient, and then the fast charging
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.720]   enables them and wireless charging,
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.320]   any tables you just set it on your desk,
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.840]   set it down, it's almost like it's charging
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.240]   without you even thinking about it
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:54.760]   in the moments when you aren't using it and don't need it.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:57.760]   It can be recharging itself.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.240]   I think those are some of the more promising
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:04.560]   and more likely things to give us some benefits
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.560]   and some leaps forward in this area.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:09.080]   - Corncob in the chat room was asking
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.160]   how hydrogen's gonna play in.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.080]   And it made me think, you're talking about
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:17.280]   all the companies that have been hyped and then disappeared
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:19.560]   and it made me think of Bloom Energy,
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:24.240]   which had this huge 60 minutes of exposé.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.520]   We covered it on Good Morning America.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.760]   It was a hydrogen-based energy solution
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:32.680]   that Google and eBay were putting in place
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:37.360]   and promised, but everyone's so hyped up about it.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.440]   And the question that I think I have going back is,
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.960]   what is gonna be the game changer here?
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:45.120]   I mean, I think Elon Musk getting involved is huge.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.600]   I'm waiting for the energy, the electricity companies
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.440]   to get involved.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.760]   I mean, they have, they're in, everyone's talked
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.840]   about the renewable death spiral that they're in
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.200]   and that only batteries are gonna solve that,
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.360]   but they're not innovating or banding together
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.240]   or creating financial models,
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.760]   whereby they might be able to smooth out their grid.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:04.040]   I mean, I'd like to see an environment
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:08.640]   where they are subsidizing something like the Powerwall
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.680]   so that people are, they control the algorithm
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.040]   and they can then pull from those Powerwalls
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:17.680]   when they're seeing dips of clouds or the wind going down,
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.760]   but they're not, they're just letting the industry take over
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:21.760]   and not playing apart.
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:25.960]   - Well, I think there is some movement on that front.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.680]   The Power companies traditionally have been very anti-all
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.760]   this stuff because it disrupts what has been an established
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.840]   business model for, say for a hundred years,
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.160]   but it's not going to work anymore.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:38.280]   I mean, you've seen in, I think it's Arizona,
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:41.840]   they got a legislation passed where solar powered owners
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:44.400]   had to pay a premium to the electricity company
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.880]   for generating their own power, not gonna play.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:50.120]   That short-term thing, never gonna work.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.640]   I think some Power companies are starting to embrace,
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:55.320]   and particularly with the Tesla battery,
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:58.160]   you're seeing Power companies getting on board with that.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.160]   Some people are starting to learn,
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.560]   but it comes back to what we were talking about
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.040]   at the start of the show.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:06.640]   The record labels fought against online music for so long
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.800]   and it nearly destroyed them.
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:10.120]   The electricity companies will do the same,
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.480]   but hopefully, you honestly might have smartened up a bit
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.160]   and seen that if a strong wind is coming,
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.440]   you build windmills, not wind breaks.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.840]   - Well, we'll see.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.160]   I mean, it hasn't been terribly inspirational,
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:25.440]   but once the death spiral starts for real,
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.600]   and there's a tipping point in terms of the number of people
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.880]   that are going with solar,
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.120]   certainly out here in the West,
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.800]   where adoption rates are so high,
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:35.560]   you'd think that they would smell the death now
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.440]   of their own industry and get involved.
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.360]   - They are worried in that traditionally
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.480]   with the power generation industry,
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.880]   as societies develop, there's been a steady increase
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.440]   in power use, and now that started to dip
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.840]   because people are losing using less power,
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.800]   but also generating their own power.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.880]   And that's, I think, set off a lot of warning signals
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:57.080]   in some areas of management of some electricity companies,
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:00.280]   but there is enormous momentum of conservatism
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.480]   and conservative thought going on in there
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:05.440]   that says, just stick with what we know, it's what we know.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:06.640]   It makes no sense.
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.120]   You can't stand against technology like that.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.640]   - But what happens is that when a company starts seeing
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:17.000]   the end to their company and the way that they do business,
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.200]   part of a brain that deals with protection,
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.320]   the limbic system goes into override,
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.320]   and we become highly protectionistic,
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.240]   and we end up going to old ways, old habits,
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.800]   which you can even see, if I used to have a test,
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.840]   I would bite my nails, it was just an old habit.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.040]   And so when you see the end of your company
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.600]   and you have to jump onto a new ship,
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.280]   change is really scary for people.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.560]   There's a lot more risk and change
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.240]   than doing things the old way.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.880]   And it's the same reason why people keep on doing things
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.960]   that don't work for them, and they just continue
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:49.080]   with the same patterns, or just pattern oriented naturally.
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.200]   And so that, the same thing that happens with large companies,
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:55.280]   they want to stick with the ways that work to try it in true,
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.280]   and unfortunately, often when times get worse,
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.480]   they become more protectionistic, not more modern.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.280]   And so you end up seeing the same thing
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.560]   with like cable companies and other things.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.520]   They're holding on to old traditional values
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:13.440]   that no longer work because adoption is just such a scary thing.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.280]   - Having Georgia here and bringing in this whole
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:18.120]   emotional intelligence into the tech conversation
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:18.960]   is awesome.
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:19.800]   (laughs)
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.440]   I've truly enjoyed it.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.000]   I've truly enjoyed it.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.240]   I think I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say,
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.600]   we have covered the week's tech news.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.120]   There are a few things we left out,
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.040]   but in the absence of our great spiritual leader,
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.440]   Leo Laport, we did the best we could,
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.520]   and a huge thank you to the guests who are here.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:42.600]   Ian Thompson of the Register, he is @IAIN.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.680]   - Yes, my family and I have had words about them.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:47.640]   - Yes, it makes for a challenging Twitter handle.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.320]   - Georgia Dow, she's Georgia_Dow from Imore
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.360]   and our emotional, our EQ expert at large.
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.360]   Joining us from Canada,
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.760]   we've got a real sort of international thing going here
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.280]   with the Brit here on my right, the Canadian.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.480]   And then Jason Heiner, tech republic, editor in chief,
