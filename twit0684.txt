[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.280]   I'm going to introduce each of you.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.360]   I decided to do something a little bit different.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.920]   I'm going to read what you wrote about yourselves on Twitter.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.840]   So I'm going to start with Brian McCulloch.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.280]   He's @BrianMCC.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.120]   And he says he's Tech meme ride home podcast guy.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.240]   Internet history podcast guy.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.680]   2016 Ted resident.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.120]   He has a book.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   How the internet happened from Netscape to the iPhone.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.480]   I've got it right here.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.480]   That's available for pre-order.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.480]   Brian McCulloch.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.560]   You know, you got a lot of stuff in there.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.560]   Tell us about the book.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   That's pretty exciting.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.640]   October 23rd.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.400]   It comes out how the internet happened.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.280]   And it's pretty simple.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.720]   I go from Netscape and the Netscape IPO opening up the modern era to we thought a good place
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.960]   to end was the iPhone because that sort of sets the table for the modern modern era.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   All right.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   Well, we're going to get into some of that.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.200]   I heard on one podcast this week someone said that the EU has lost the internet.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.080]   So you're the guy to talk about this.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.600]   Next up, Mike Sergeant.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.160]   You're @MikeAsargent on Twitter.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.080]   And there's so many questions that your hand that you folks.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   Dog enthusiast, tech enthusiast, pensive being, podcaster, professor of shower dining, TM,
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.840]   senior editor at Mobile Nations.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.600]   This begs the question, what is shower dining?
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.560]   You know, I don't know if this is the podcast to talk about that.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.360]   It's a rather controversial topic.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.600]   I have been on a breakfast podcast where I talked about shower dining before.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   Essentially it's the idea that some people like to bring beverages and food into the shower
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.200]   while they're taking a shower and consume said beverages and or food.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.720]   And I happen to be one that does it and is only somewhat ashamed of the fact that I do.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.680]   And for some reason, it's just sort of stuck.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   And now people constantly either ask me or tease me about the fact that I do that.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.080]   But food is least impacted by the shower.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.720]   Ooh, the food that's least impacted by the shower would actually be, well, it depends
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   on your word for impact because like, if we're talking like impact in a negative way, then
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.200]   I would say everybody should try having an orange in the shower because it's not impacted.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.680]   It's actually improved by the shower.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.200]   But people probably don't want to have something like spaghetti in the shower or pizza in the
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.880]   shower because things can get kind of complicated.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.240]   I personally am a proponent of beer or margaritas in the shower.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.840]   And I'm just going to say those two things really improve a shower.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   So I agree.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.280]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.880]   Oh, doctor.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.000]   He writes, Oh, my Lord, we're looking at the memoji of O doctor.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.480]   I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480]   I always look like this.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.080]   This is who I am as a person.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.600]   This is what Apple made me.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.120]   So for those of you who are listening, I'm going to describe this.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.720]   I would say, what would, how would you describe your paint?
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.160]   Is it clean shaven?
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.160]   Is it bald?
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.160]   desk?
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.160]   Is it follicle?
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   Follicle.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   Lessened.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   Pate.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.720]   I have the second bald head.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.760]   I have the fifth beard and I have the third mustache and these eyebrows.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.960]   Like I said earlier, blessed by the Lord himself.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.120]   They look like this in real life.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.440]   So I don't know who did these, but they look amazing.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   Oh, doctor, is it adorable to begin with?
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.560]   His memoji has these huge like Hello Kitty eyes going right now.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.960]   It's sort of disturbing, but it's creepy.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.640]   I like what I don't eat in the shower.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.560]   I'm too big for that.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.800]   So I do have a, I have a snack, some grapes in the bathtub when I put the candle lights
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.400]   on, I might have a glass of wine, but eating in the shower, I feel, I feel bad about my
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.720]   size of high to crude to the shower.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.800]   I'm like, man, I'm already big enough.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.040]   I don't need to eat in the shower too.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.400]   You know, the thing about the memoji of O doctor is he's completely disembodied.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.640]   It is just a floating head.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.320]   So you're really working with your best assets here.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.080]   We're going to talk about how Apple is missing out on not letting this be a feature with
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080]   more usage.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   I don't know.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.440]   You know what I had to do to get on this show to look like this?
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.360]   It took me a good hour and three devices and this software, it was a lot of work, Apple.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.920]   You could make this amazing.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.080]   I could be this every day.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.720]   I think if you can perfect this, you could do a memoji dating show that would be amazing.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   Oh, yes.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   I'm not good.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.600]   Oh, I'm about to copyright that.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   Don't mind the time.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.680]   I'm stealing it from you right now.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.680]   Go, go, go.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.600]   It's like a catfish because you got to reveal who you are.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.600]   It's an emoji.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   Oh my gosh.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   What is that guy?
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   I'm Ante Teo.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   Who's the guy?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.440]   The football player who got catfish.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.000]   Yeah, this is a great idea.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.320]   I like it.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.480]   This is going to be a good panel today and we have a lot to talk about because it was
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.240]   a huge week for Tech News with it being an Apple week.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.600]   I'm going to be, you know, we started with the sports talk here with football players
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.240]   who've been catfished and I'm going to do play by play and have you guys do the color
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.840]   commentary about the Apple event.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.760]   I think the big headline for everybody was the Apple Watch 4.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.640]   They removed the bezel and they say the screen is 30% bigger on the watch.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.440]   It's $4.99 with the cellular connection, $3.99 without it.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.040]   Speakers now 50% louder.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.720]   They've moved the microphone to the other side of the watch to minimize echo.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.280]   The watch back is now ceramic and Apple says that's going to improve cellular connectivity.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.040]   But the thing everybody is talking about had to do with health.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.320]   It has an electrocardiogram feature.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.120]   You put electrodes on the digital crown and on the back of the watch so you put your finger
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.280]   on the crown and using those two inputs, the watch figures out the electrical activity
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.920]   in your heart.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:08.080]   This whole process takes 30 seconds but they've gotten this cleared by the FDA to provide
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.720]   that ECG data.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.400]   It gets stored in your health app when you do one of these and it can be exported as
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.720]   a PDF for your doctor.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.000]   It also has fall detection, the accelerometer is improved and the gyroscope so it detects
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.480]   involuntary motions.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:29.720]   The arms and body I guess do very specific things when you fall forward or you slip backwards.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.400]   It'll make a call for help if you don't move within a minute.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:41.280]   I think Apple laid it out pretty clearly that the watch is about connectivity, fitness,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.280]   and health.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.080]   We think that the new features are a must get and this is really going to change the game
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.280]   for the wearables market.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.640]   This was an interesting moment for me.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:09:00.600]   The morning before, technically the morning of, the 2 in the morning before the Apple
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.080]   event, I went to the ER.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:11.360]   I was having some stuff going on with my heart that I hadn't experienced since last year.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.800]   I thought it was over, came back again, went to the ER and they got me all checked out
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.080]   and said, "Ah yes, the AFib is popping up again.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.040]   We need to look into this some more."
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.400]   I tried to make light of the situation by joking about how then Apple was rumored to
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.600]   be announcing a watch that was going to be able to detect AFib and also have ECG and things
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.520]   like that.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.480]   I think this watch is incredible for many reasons.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.920]   Those things obviously are the things that matter most to me.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.760]   When I went to the ER in December, I shortly afterward upgraded to the Series 3 because
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.200]   there were improved heart rate tracking features and things like that.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.440]   It was easy to give my doctor that information and say, "Hey, here's what my heart's doing.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.760]   Let's see what's going on."
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.520]   I absolutely am going to be upgrading to the Series 4.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.000]   I do want to note, as I've talked about this this week and been very excited about it,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.800]   I've gotten lots of feedback from people who want to tell me all about 12-lead ECGs and
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.000]   halter monitors and things like that.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.200]   It's important to understand that no, a device on your wrist is never going to replace the
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.880]   medical instruments that you are using in the hospital or a halter monitor that you might
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.080]   take home and use for a week that's monitoring your heart 24/7.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.720]   However, this device is better than nothing and to have this with me everywhere I go is
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.920]   pretty great.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:42.360]   I'm quite excited about having these extra heart rate tracking features, but I am certainly
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.320]   not assuming that this is going to serve as a replacement for anything that I can get
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.720]   in the hospital or with my doctor.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.280]   It's got to be a piece of mine too.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.960]   If you're having something with your heart, it is called the Silent Killer.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:03.720]   It's scary because you don't know when your heart's out of regular sinus rhythm.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.080]   Having that data, one quick question there, how does the Series 3 already do that?
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.480]   Does it keep a log somewhere?
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.160]   The Series 3, of course, it doesn't do the ECG thing.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   With WatchOS 5 and I think that this next feature is coming later this year, it's going
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.240]   to be better at doing rhythm tracking.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.360]   I think it's all algorithms based.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.960]   They've just figured those out.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.760]   They'll pop those in and it'll be better about tracking.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:34.200]   Right now, what the Series 3 does is it just has an improved heart rate sensor over previous
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   models.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:42.080]   I was using the Series 0 Apple Watch way long time ago and upgrading to the Series 3 improved
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.080]   that.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.760]   It also offers a high heart rate detection.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.680]   Of course, keeping a log throughout the day and then it's like, "Whoa, your heart rate's
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.400]   over blank and you've just been sitting."
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.520]   It doesn't make sense that your heart rate is like this.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.000]   You watching a scary movie or is there something going wrong?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.640]   For me, that was important because that's what led me to the ER the first time around
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:10.920]   was having this heart rate that was above 140 and I was doing absolutely nothing.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:18.240]   All those stories that popped out this week of concern trolling and Apple claims this is
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.120]   a medical device but it's not really a medical device.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.480]   I feel like that was everybody writing for headlines but I found it more interesting.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.240]   If you read in beyond the headlines and those stories, Apple was very clear that even the
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.400]   FDA in giving them the clearance for it made them make it clear that this is not a replacement
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.960]   for actual doctor's attention or medical care or anything like that.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.680]   I found it interesting.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:50.560]   In a way, Apple's doing it right or at least doing it methodically.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:58.120]   This is technically classified as a class two device for regulatory purposes and a class
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:05.720]   one medical device is a tongue depressor and a class three is an actual pacemaker.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:11.000]   I think that actually the interesting story here is that Apple isn't going whole hog
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.840]   into we're making medical devices now.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.920]   They're creeping in incrementally and they're doing all the steps right and actually I think
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.640]   that that'll help them gain credibility so that maybe however many years down the road
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.240]   when it can do more serious medical monitoring then they'll have this track record behind
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.720]   them of being methodical and taking it slowly and doing it the right way.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.280]   The specific information they say it's not for people who have heart conditions that it's
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.920]   for people who are generally considered healthy and as you mentioned it's not FDA approved,
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.000]   it's FDA cleared.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   It's a step into the health aspects and the fact that it passively tracks all this and
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.120]   you can access it after the fact, kind of a black box if you will.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.040]   It's great when you're going to your doctor I was talking to a cardiologist at Stanford
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.920]   and he had worked with a lot of the folks who make wearables and overall he said that
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.800]   the technology is really accurate.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.920]   The calorie counts are all over the map and not very accurate at all but that the heart
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.800]   rate monitoring is pretty good and the fact that you can now do that in conjunction with
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:32.240]   this sinus rhythm and finding out about tachycardia or any of the AFib that they're talking about
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.520]   it at least gives you data to go to your doctor with.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.160]   So I'll be the opposite of everyone.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.640]   We love you for that.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:48.320]   So the series three tells you if you had a high rate, the four series will actually tell
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.680]   you now if you have a low rate that's really nice.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.560]   But the way Apple presented it, the way regular people consume it, it's FDA approved.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.760]   Oh my gosh, people are losing their minds because they don't read and they just hear
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.680]   the way Apple presents things on stage.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.400]   So unless you're a tech person and you're reading in the articles, people think that
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.080]   it's going to be a solution to some of their problems.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.160]   I have heart problems too.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.600]   I go to my doctor every three months and yes, I can use my series three wives to give her
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.520]   like an average update.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.520]   But usually when I'm there, checking that versus what they're checking is usually not
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.520]   accurate at all, which I find.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.280]   But again, that's neither here nor there.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.960]   There's also things like there could be something wrong with the watch.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:35.560]   So you know, the dependability of it versus the credibility that Apple gets is what concerns
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.040]   me the way people just gush all over everything Apple.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.560]   And cleared, not really approved.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.640]   I love to get my hands on one because I do take medication.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.160]   But again, it's not really for me.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.000]   It's for a healthy person that might need to do something because if you're sick, they
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.560]   don't want you relying on this thing at all.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.720]   You need to rely on your doctor.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.880]   So yay, we can do a EKG.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.200]   Maybe get a D-fib in series five, necessitate myself.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.880]   You know, that'd be cool.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.280]   You know what would sell me on this?
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.760]   You know, it would get my money off the bat.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:14.240]   If it had a glucose reader, if it knew my sugar levels up, I would throw somebody to
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.000]   the ditch and spend $1,000 on that watch right now if they tell them glucose.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.520]   But again, that's what Apple does.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.640]   They hype everything up, make sure you get it by yourself.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.720]   They're in this series and this watch, they are ahead of the competition bottom line after
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   all that yelling.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   I just did they are ahead of everybody.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.040]   So at least they're a step ahead everybody.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.080]   But I'm just saying don't go dependent on this watch to wake you up in the middle of
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.960]   the night and say, hey, you having a heart attack brother?
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.960]   Are you dreaming hard?
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   What's going on?
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   Wake up.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   The watch ain't going to save you.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.600]   Well, the chat room said that the new watch is going to be like the WebMD of heart disease
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.160]   that everybody's going to have some sort of moment and freak out and that cardiologists
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.840]   are going to see their appointment schedules just fill up.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.200]   Is there an unforeseen consequence that we're not anticipating?
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.120]   So two things, a real quick one.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.520]   I fall in and I can't get out.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.760]   Oh, we got a slip thing going on.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.760]   Everybody's made that joke.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.920]   I made it instantly as soon as I saw the oh, if you fall, it'll shut up.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.360]   My kid will fall every 30 seconds.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.280]   I think I'll be calling the cops five times a week.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:22.200]   Secondly, last year at the Super Bowl, guys watch was alerting him and bells was going
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.000]   off because he was excited about the Super Bowl.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.760]   They scored a touchdown and his heart rate was like 156 or something.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.560]   And the watch is like, you're dying right now.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.560]   Is everything okay?
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   You need to go call somebody.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.160]   So he was in a situation where he wasn't freaking out because he knew why his heart rate was
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   through the roof.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.400]   But again, I think they're so smart though in really identifying heart disease and falling
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.160]   because I don't know if it's just serendipity, but my dad's been talking about getting an
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.560]   Apple watch for a long time.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   And that's where it's good.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:58.080]   Suddenly becomes a replacement for that little thing that you, you know, that you advertise
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   and it's going to show.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.400]   So lots of people commented on that how they're clearly targeting an older demographic.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.040]   There was the hokey pokey song.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   There was, I can't remember who pointed it out.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:17.960]   It might have been, I'm sorry, but that it wasn't a video of all thin, you know, young
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   people.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.480]   It was people of all sizes and all ages.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:27.480]   And so yeah, a lot of people commented that that maybe this is targeting an audience that
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.520]   wouldn't have considered a wearable before.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.240]   One thing that Jason Snell was talking about earlier in the week from Six Colors, Mac enthusiasts
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.560]   from Wayback is that finally Apple has figured out what the watch is, that when it first
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.280]   came out, it was, it was going to do everything under the sun.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.480]   It was going to be photos.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.200]   It was going to be a payment technology.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.600]   It was going to be everything that you ever wanted.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.880]   And now they have really clearly identified what the mission of the watch is.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.720]   And it's some connectivity and then the health and the fitness aspects.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.640]   And I wondering, have any of you guys had the watch with the cellular connection?
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.320]   And do you think that is worth the extra hundred bucks in the $10 a month?
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.200]   I mean, does any of that make sense?
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.400]   And is that the future too?
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:25.920]   My next one is going to be the series four that I've ordered will have cellular connectivity.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.480]   It's not something that makes a whole lot of sense to me.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:36.520]   I think for a whole lot of people because when I sort of look at my family is kind of like
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.720]   the, my I guess litmus test.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.160]   I don't know exactly what to go.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.360]   But whenever I'm sort of trying to figure out sort of get out of my own head and be
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.880]   more empathetic about what everyday people use instead of those of us in tech, I can
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:53.320]   just look to my siblings and family members and see sort of how they use technology.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   And I don't see any of them ever walking out the door without their phone.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.600]   Like that comes with them.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.080]   That's this thing that comes with them.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:05.820]   And so the benefit of the Apple Watch, of course, is to have those opportunities available
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.640]   to you without having the phone nearby.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.920]   So when it comes to something like health and, you know, potential emergency situations,
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   that is where the cellular could come in handy.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.120]   But I don't think that those things happen enough that it's like, yes, go ahead and
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.360]   spend all this extra money to get a cellular version.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.800]   But all that said, as the person who is steeped in technology all day and wants to try new
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:34.520]   things, I am looking forward to from time to time, leaving the house without my phone
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.200]   and just having my watch and seeing what that's like and how it works for me.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.000]   The one place that's made sense for me is in the water.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.520]   So like all, if I go for a big paddleboard or if I'm surfing, it's the one time when
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.440]   I've actually gotten a call from my boss while I was surfing and had that conversation on
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.040]   the watch.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.280]   And you know, it always amazes me that it sounds as good as it does.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.320]   But I can't think of many other scenarios besides the water when you're actually not
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   going to have your phone with you.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.160]   So can I jump in on that?
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160]   Oh, please do.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.640]   Shameless plug.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.560]   I have a new podcast called Raisin and Ninja and the episode is dropping tomorrow is situational
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.560]   awareness.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:22.880]   So last year, my daughter had two instances where there was a threat to the school.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.840]   One was in, they thought a kid brought a gun to school and the other one was something
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.560]   with violence in the school where the school was shut down.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.560]   The cops came out.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.880]   You can't get a hold of your kid.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.600]   My daughter, the day after the first time it happened, I went and got, because I had the
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.560]   first I've watched, I went and got myself a series three.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.120]   I got her a series three.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.640]   She understands now that a season is a situation where there's an active shooter or there's
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.400]   a fire or anything like that.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.960]   She presses the SOS on her watch.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.680]   I know what's going on.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   I can talk to her.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.920]   I can find her in that school because she was not a mentorship school.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.280]   They don't carry their phones around them all the time because they're not allowed to.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.160]   And even high school, they might not always have their phone if they're in gym or whatever.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.840]   With the watch on, she has her watch with her everywhere she goes.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.600]   We live in a walking district where she has to walk home.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   Same thing.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600]   She's walking home.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.840]   She's got that watch on instead of having her phone out.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.600]   And for me, it is very important.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   In the classroom.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.560]   In the chat room, they just said that their school has banned Apple watches from the classroom
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.560]   just like they've banned phones.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.960]   So that's a really interesting use case.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:34.120]   And the whole thing about parents and kids and devices, that's an interesting way of
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.400]   thinking about the watch.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.920]   And I went to my, her teacher specifically and I said, you were not to remove her watch.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.160]   This stays on her at all times.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   This is her device.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.720]   She's responsible.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.720]   She knows not to play with this.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.240]   She knows not to use it.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.880]   But for me again, that piece of mind for having that on her wrist.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.000]   And I'm not trying to act like I'm Rambo, but I'm not going to be like those people
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.120]   in Florida sitting there with cops not going in there because they're scared.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.240]   And I'll know where my kid is.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.640]   I'll know what room she's in.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.720]   I'll know a part of the building.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.720]   She's in.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   I want to know those things.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.880]   I can talk to her if she's hiding or doing anything.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.040]   So now for nothing.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.520]   First of all, I got a deal and a buy one, get one half of my bill is I only pay $10
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.920]   for one line and five for the next is worth it.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.920]   People out there asking me about bulletproof backpack for 500 bucks.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.520]   I've been $500 in this watch and $10 a month and has that kind of security.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.160]   They're thinking your kid's going to walk around with a 40 pound backpack on top of
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.360]   the books and they're going to carry the background with them everywhere they go because they're
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.520]   not going to.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.920]   So that watch and that's the other service for me.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.320]   Well, we're at the investment for my child.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.440]   I did have one moment where I thought that that might work for my kid.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.200]   My daughters and son are a little bit younger than your daughter, I think.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.040]   And so she was going on a bike ride and she and her friends were going to go down on
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.400]   through the neighborhood and go to the trailhead and ride on the trail.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   And I thought this is perfect.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.000]   I'll give her my watch and she can call home if they need anything.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.240]   So everything's great.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.640]   She gets home about, I don't know, 45 minutes later.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.160]   And I said, that was so great knowing you had the watch.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:07.400]   And her face just goes, she sat down when she was on the mountain bike trail, taken the
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.520]   watch off to show her friends and left it on the ground.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.520]   No.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.520]   What?
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.720]   So GPS, because it was cellular, could you go find it or what's it deal?
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   I'm wearing it now on my wrist.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.600]   It was found.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.480]   But that's 500 dollar piece of equipment that you're putting on a kid's arm.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.920]   And protein for a parent, you might want to have them get used to wearing them before
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.880]   you just send them off on an adventure.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.480]   You know what they're going to do?
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.720]   Again, if you follow me, you could get all my tips and tricks.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   My daughters had a cell phone since she was four years old.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.560]   She's never broken or cracked a screen or lost a phone.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.520]   Her watch is in perfect health.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.960]   Like I have a routine structure for her, for any kid to keep them on track for not breaking
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.960]   and losing their devices.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.320]   But you should have often been wearing this.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.240]   Adults can come and hate you to learn those techniques as well.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.560]   There you go.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.480]   That along with my Dayton emoji app, we going to get this down by.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.960]   Sending my kids to you for summer camp, oh, dr.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   Let's go.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.320]   Oh, man, they'll be back so fast.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.760]   I love you so much after dealing with me.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.760]   They don't want to deal with me.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:16.400]   I will move on to the phones unless, do you guys, Brian or Mike have anything else you want
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.320]   to say on the watches?
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.240]   No, I think that pretty much covers it.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.960]   I do want to one more time though, reiterate.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.160]   I think, oh, dr. covered it quite well.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:34.520]   This is not a replacement for going to your doctor and having them strap all of those
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.840]   different pads all over your body and freak you out and then say, we're checking you for
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.840]   a heart attack.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.280]   And then you're like, I'm having a heart attack.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.360]   No, we're checking you for one.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.160]   And it's not a replacement for the very expensive halter monitor that you have to wear for a
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.000]   week that you take home and you look like a robot with a battery pack connected to you.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And I love that thing.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.560]   I love that battery pack.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.080]   I felt like I was like Darth Vader for like a week.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.760]   I kept looking for something there.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.440]   I'm going for all that.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.880]   It was what happened to December.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.720]   It was the day before my birthday.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.440]   So I wasn't able to go out on my birthday because heart stuff and also because I looked
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.840]   like a robot and didn't want to be out and about.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.200]   So anyway, Apple Watch is great.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.720]   I'm looking forward to having these features and having this information to give to my doctor.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.880]   But you need to know that it is not a replacement.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.880]   Right.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.880]   All right.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.600]   Let's move on to the iPhones.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:35.120]   We saw an iterative release of the iPhone XS and the XS Mac.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.760]   So let's go through the specs here.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.320]   So the XS is a 5.8 inch display.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:45.880]   It's as big as the 8 Plus in terms of that display, but it's in a thinner form factor.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:52.080]   The iPhone XS Max is 6.5 inches.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:58.040]   They are $1,100 respectively come in gold, silver, space gray.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.600]   They ship September 21.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.200]   OLED screens.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.320]   The H12 bionic chip.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.720]   The camera.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.280]   The 12 megapixel camera.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.400]   It's got a bigger sensor, 2X optical zoom.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.320]   They really spent a lot of time on the camera aspects.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:20.720]   You really realize how much a part of their sense of what they're improving is based
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   on that camera.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.160]   And it's obviously a huge part of why we upgrade our phones.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.840]   These have smart HDR.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:33.360]   The two cameras so that it can do, they say a trillion processes per photo, four frames,
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.040]   then they create inner frames at a different exposure.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.480]   So what they can do then is combine them and maximize where the highlights and the shadows
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.280]   are.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.040]   There's a feature in the software that people are pretty excited about that lets you use
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.720]   a slider to soften or sharpen the back focus.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.680]   So you can really mess with that depth of field.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:00.960]   So those are the 10s and the 10s max.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.400]   Now we'll get into that in one second.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:12.680]   The iPhone XR is the $750 model.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.600]   It comes in white, black, blue, yellow, coral, and product red.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.800]   The biggest difference, it has only one camera so you don't have as much depth of field bells
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.040]   and whistles that you can play with.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.920]   It's an LCD screen, not an OLED, and it doesn't ship until October 26th.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.840]   So I want to start with the naming convention so we can just get that right out of the way.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.160]   iPhone XS, iPhone XS.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.960]   The Apple folks say 10s.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.960]   Why is everyone in this?
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.960]   >> But everyone else says XS.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.400]   >> Did you notice so much, like how much trouble you just had trying to do the rundown?
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.920]   I had the same problem doing the show that day.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:01.760]   My writing partner and I got done, I recorded the thing, and I listened back before posting.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   And I'm like, did I even get that right?
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.040]   I didn't even understand what I had said to a degree.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.560]   And it's so hard to even encapsulate.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.520]   You just tried to do it in a minute, minute and a half, and it's still, it's fumbling.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.520]   >> It's so confusing.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.120]   >> I watched this with my 10 year old son, and he got to the end of it and he says, "Mommy,
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.400]   I want the 10xS plus max."
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.400]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.640]   >> So the way I call him is, I call it the iPhone really.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.920]   I call it the iPhone Christmas, and then I call the XS the iPhone Trump.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.840]   Like really, you're trying to tell me the same thing with the same thing you're trying
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.280]   to act like is different?
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   Okay, okay.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.360]   You're going to talk to me.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.200]   Okay, let somebody say some positive stuff so I can get into ripping all the stuff that
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   Apple did wrong again this year.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.520]   I think, so somebody don't say something positive.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.160]   I don't think we have any positive things to say about this in particular.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:00.320]   I've noticed that, again, sort of going back to, okay, what do people, when I take off
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.760]   my, I'm a tech person, and that's all I think about kind of thing, and just listen to what
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.400]   everyday people say.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.240]   They say iPhone X and iPhone 10 interchangeably.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.960]   But one of the things, I saw this, I can't remember who was talking about it, but the,
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:21.960]   Roman numerals are hard enough for folks already, and about the only time that it seems that
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:28.800]   the general public is interested in Roman numerals is when that big sports ball game
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.240]   comes around where there are lots of Roman numerals.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   Yeah, I can't remember which Super Bowl it was because I can't parse all the Xs and
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.560]   Ls and I'm too lazy.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.560]   So I'm leaving.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.280]   MXVLSI or whatever.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:47.560]   But then they added a C and an R. So like it's just begging you to call it the X at this
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   point.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.200]   Yeah, and that's, it makes it hard because exactly, you've already got a Roman numeral,
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.160]   then you want to add a letter afterward and people get confused.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:02.880]   And it's just at this point, it's like, I don't know that any makes any sense.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.040]   But for me, it doesn't matter because when I go in, you know, to look at what I'm going
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.600]   to get, it's like, I want the bigger one of this or the smaller one of this.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:17.960]   And I think that that is many times how I don't see my younger brother going in and saying,
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.160]   I want the iPhone 10s.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.280]   I want it in 256 gigabytes.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.480]   I want it in stainless steel.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.960]   He would go in and say, can you show me what you have here?
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.720]   I know I want the bigger one.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.240]   And I think I want it in white glass.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.280]   And you know what I mean?
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.200]   Like we all use different terms to describe these things.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.920]   And so it's just kind of like Apple that does it this way.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   And I think that's the way that Apple has to be.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   And I think that's the way that Apple has to be.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   And I think that's the way that Apple has to be.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   And I think that's the way that Apple has to be.

[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.920]   It's not just, hey, we'll give you a .3 inch better screen.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.920]   They usually have optimization or something different in the phones.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   I'm so angry.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   Brian, any thoughts on why they would do this if it wasn't intentional?
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   Well, okay.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.920]   I said on the Tech meme show this week that car companies figured this out a hundred years ago.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.920]   Originally they did Model A, Model T.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   After you do it for a decade, two decades, it gets too complicated.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.920]   And it's just, it's the 2018 Honda Civic.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   And then there will be a 2019 and there will be a 2020.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:24.920]   So by the way, my personal theory is that when would be a really clean time to break convention
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:30.920]   and say it's the 2020 iPhone, it might actually be next year because car companies do that.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   Like they release, you know, or announced the year earlier.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.920]   This is the 20.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   So what if next fall, the new iPhone is the 2020 iPhone?
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:44.920]   And then that would be a clean break from this sort of confusion and the old naming conventions
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   and they just moved to the year model.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.920]   I like it.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.920]   Yes.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   It might get Brian a beer.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.920]   That was good.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   That was good.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   That was a, that was a, that was a cypher.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   That would make you think better.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.920]   If that happens, then all the rest of this mess will feel okay.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   Well, and then also, so then if you have this problem, you could, you could go back to then
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.920]   there's the mini and the max and the whatever.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.920]   But if it's the 2018 max or the 2018, then it's, it's, it's, you're hanging your house
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.920]   on something solid as opposed to whatever they're doing now.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   Was there anything you guys thought we would see from the Apple event that we didn't?
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   That you wanted to?
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.920]   Well, obviously the, the power mat, but then even in that, that beginning video with the,
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.920]   the mission impossible thing and she's, she's doing like where, how, I was super expecting
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   that there was going to be these big advances for, for the year pods.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   And there was nothing like that.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   That's a story that I want someone to dig into.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.920]   How did they, how did they spend that much money on a mission impossible intro when this
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.920]   is the one year your video, your pictures got leaked?
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.920]   You, y'all can't do mission impossible after leaking out the pictures of the phone and the
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   why.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   Tim Cook, you need to fire yourself and get your own clicker brother.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.920]   Walk across, can't be good.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   You don't click it.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   That's what you need to do because there's no reason for mission impossible when you can't
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.920]   keep a picture, lock down.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.920]   That would have never happened to Mrs. Steve.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.920]   I've never.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   I'm not going to be crazy about this phone.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   This is a, okay, I'm getting a max.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.920]   I'm getting a 256.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   I'm about to spend $1200 on a phone with a funky monkey brick from 1976 on a, I can't even
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.920]   get quick charging for, for $1200, I can't even get a quick charging block.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   For $1200, I no longer get headphones and a dongle.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.920]   I hate dongles, but you want me to spend $999 for this dongle?
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   Go forward and I just spent $1200?
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.920]   Apple is wild boy.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.920]   No accessory bloat here, oh, doctor.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   They're not going to give you that little, that little thing you plug into the wall because
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   it's not environmental.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.920]   It's not environmental.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.920]   You have, you have quick charging, but you don't supply quick charging.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.920]   You can go get a one plus phone for $500 right now.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   And guess what?
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.920]   They give you a quick charging block.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:58.920]   I hate Apple so much in effect, but I'm still addicted to these phone system drives me crazy
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   and that's just ignorant.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   They just slap me in my face and disrespecting me.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.920]   And they look like I can't keep a mean face with this emoji.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.920]   This is me scouring right now.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.920]   I'm struggling to keep it mean.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   Ooh, emoji scouring.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.920]   It's tough.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.920]   Ooh, it's rough.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   My face, I'm going to have a headache when I get done.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   You still have little shitty emoji eyes though.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   So, you know, it doesn't quite all translate.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.920]   You are though.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   I've decided that, you know, there's racon tours.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   You're a rant on tour.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.920]   You're rant is the best rant business man.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.920]   I do appreciate you.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   Mike, anything that you wanted to see that you didn't?
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:37.920]   Well, actually I would love to briefly, briefly, briefly touch on the advancements that didn't
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.920]   happen this year.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:44.920]   I think it's fascinating that so in years past, I have always had this like internal desire
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   to get the new iPhone.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.920]   You know, it comes out.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   It's it could be the S series or it could be the normal series.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.920]   Always very into it.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.920]   And this is the first year, genuinely, that I have not had that feeling that the these new
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.920]   phones.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.920]   Me too.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.520]   Yeah, they don't there's nothing about them that is so much greater or even like a small
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.920]   amount greater in my mind than the tin that makes them worth it.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.920]   And I think part of the problem is that I was like madly in love with the tin.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   It was a fantastic it is.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   I should say a fantastic phone.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   It is it felt new.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   It felt fresh.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   It was exciting.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.920]   These phones, they spent so much time on stage.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.600]   I was like, I thought this was a consumer event because they had this whole section just
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.200]   talking about that age 12 bionic.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.280]   And like it's cool.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:35.760]   It's got more cores and all of this other stuff and and you know, the image signal processor
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:42.880]   is improved, but that doesn't translate that well to your everyday consumer.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.960]   And there's nothing about these phones other than just like a larger screen that to me
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.160]   really stands out.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:54.800]   Like faster face ID is interesting, but I never really thought that it wasn't, you know, fast
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.560]   enough and the better waterproof stuff.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.320]   Oh, doctor already taught taught me not to drop my phone in the pool.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.920]   So I'm good there.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:10.080]   It's yeah, like there isn't anything here that stuck out to me that if someone came to
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.400]   me and said, Hey, should I upgrade?
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.200]   And I say, do you have an iPhone 10?
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.840]   And then they say, Yes, I'm going to say no, no, don't please don't upgrade.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.960]   This is going to ask what phone does everybody have?
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.360]   I have on 10.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.880]   Eight.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.520]   So I have the seven and I was now going to upgrade to the max.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.600]   And I asked my daughter who has my six S plus.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.000]   I said, Do you want the 10?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.720]   Because I was going to give it to her just to get it.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.000]   I knew I was skipping it.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.360]   And she's like, No, it's too small.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.360]   I don't want it.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.360]   And I'm like, Are you insane?
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.360]   Like this phone so much better?
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.360]   She's like, I don't care.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.360]   I want a bigger phone.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.240]   So now again, she's looking to me like if I don't if if you she didn't ask for it, she's
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.560]   like, But if I can't get the bigger one, then I'll just keep this six S plus or I'll take
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.920]   your old seven S plus.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.840]   I don't want that smaller form factor in my hand.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.680]   She wants to be able to hold the bigger device.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.160]   And that's something that's interesting to me because you know, that's her main device.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.680]   So she wants it bigger.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   But if you don't if you have the 10, there is absolutely no reason for you to upgrade
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.560]   at all at all.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.600]   And that and that's I feel like that's going to be a strike against Apple going forward.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.440]   And I guess they're waiting to see if this are as a big hit to get quote unquote cheaper
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.440]   sales.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.120]   But I so many people have this X.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.080]   I don't know who's upgrading cheaper at 750.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.080]   That's just crazy.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:30.560]   We're going to take this opportunity to take a break.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.560]   Leo is on vacation.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.080]   I'm Becky Worley happy to have you here with to it and Leo's going to tell you something
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.760]   about our sponsors.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.760]   Becky Becky Becky.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.440]   Thank you for filling in for me on Twitter.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.680]   And I did come back though.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.520]   I did come back because I have a very important announcement to make.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.520]   We're hiring.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.520]   No, well, I'm not.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.800]   But when we were we used it for Cruder.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:56.200]   We we found out kind of as a bit of a shock a couple of months ago that our bookkeeper
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.200]   was leaving.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.360]   She gave us two weeks notice, but but this was a big crisis for Lisa because otherwise
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.280]   if she didn't find somebody right away, she's doing the books and she didn't have time for
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   that.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   Ain't nobody got time for that.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.200]   We needed a bookkeeper fast.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.800]   I was eating breakfast when we found out.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.120]   And I said, honey, here's a chance to use a zipper cruder.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.120]   We used it before with great results, but nothing like this.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.920]   This blow blew my mind.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.720]   So she put the posting up on zipper cruder.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.160]   Now a couple of things happened first right away.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.000]   Zipper cruder posted on a hundred plus job sites, including Twitter and Facebook.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.960]   So you're reaching out everywhere.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.920]   Every corner of the world.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.240]   Everybody who could possibly be interested in this job is seeing it.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.240]   That's a good start.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:41.480]   But then zipper cruder does something remarkable.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:46.880]   With powerful matching technology, zipper cruder scans thousands of resumes to find people
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.280]   with the right experience and then invites them to apply to your job.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.440]   It's like kind of like a automated headhunter.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.520]   They find the right people and they say, Hey, you ought to look over here.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.680]   There's a great job waiting for you.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.120]   And then you apply.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   And this was amazing.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.400]   I mean, we did it at breakfast before lunch.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.480]   We had four.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.840]   It was funny because they're coming in like in an hour, the first one.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.880]   And Lisa goes, Oh, Oh, look, I got.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.880]   Oh, this is good.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.040]   She's good.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.040]   And then another one.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.080]   Oh, oh, this person's perfect.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.000]   Oh, it was really fun by lunch.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.200]   We had three or four great applicants.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.200]   Thanks to zipper cruder.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.280]   I've never seen anything like it.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:29.080]   And as the applications come in, zipper cruder analyzes each one, spotlights the top candidates
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.360]   so you won't miss a great match.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.360]   They format all the resumes so they're easy to read and all goes into the zipper cruder
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:38.560]   inbox, not into your inbox, not into your phone.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.000]   It's all in zipper cruder's interface.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.920]   And they have screening questions of all sorts of ways to narrow it down.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.000]   Zipper cruder works so well.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.160]   It's not just our experience.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:53.520]   80% of employers who post on zipper cruder get at least one qualified candidate through
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.040]   the site, quality candidate through the site within the first day.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.840]   Within the first day, we got four within the first five hours.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.120]   It blew my mind.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.880]   Zipper cruder really works.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.000]   I wonder it's the highest rated hiring site in America.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.240]   I'm thrilled to have these guys as advertisers.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.520]   I'll tell you what, it really works.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.800]   We have a great employee thanks to it.

[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.160]   The smartest way to hire.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   Becky, I would hire you if I could.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.360]   Back to Becky Worley in This Week in Tech.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.800]   Oh Leo, we've worked together on and off for long enough.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.040]   You don't need to hire me.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.360]   I'll just come and say hi every once in a while.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:53.320]   I'm Becky Worley, filling in for Leo, joined by a great crew this week on This Week in
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.520]   Tech, Brian McCullough.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.800]   He's the Tech meme ride home podcast guy.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.480]   Micah Sargent is at Mobile Nations.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.800]   He's the senior editor there, Humblinessians.com.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.720]   And oh, Dr. -- well I didn't get to read.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:14.640]   He's joining us in Memoji form, I would J.J. Storm Stone.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:20.480]   He says on his Twitter profile that he humbly tries to be Clark Kent.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:29.640]   And I mean the humility in that statement is evident at all times, oh, Dr. We are going
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.560]   to jump into -- it's so Apple-heavy this week.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.320]   We always try and mix it up and we will talk about other things.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.480]   But this was the big news of the week.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.800]   I think everybody else knows that when Apple has an event, just don't even bother.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:48.320]   So I did just want to talk a little bit about the fact that OS 12 is going to be coming
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.640]   September 17th.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.640]   That's this Monday.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.720]   They say older phones are going to be 40 to 70 percent faster at certain tasks.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:03.000]   They specifically called out the iPhone 6 Plus as benefiting from this upgrade.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.280]   And they mentioned things like the camera app will launch faster.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.760]   The keyboard will be accessible faster.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:17.600]   The other big thing that's coming in iOS 12 that -- I wouldn't say it's been promoted,
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:21.280]   but it exists is the screen time feature.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:27.760]   And this is not an app, but it's buried in the settings and it is something that Apple
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:34.800]   is doing in response to complaints and criticism from people even within their own organization
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.240]   about the addictive nature of phones.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:43.120]   I know that word comes loaded for a lot of people who think that gadgets and addiction
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.200]   that it's an overuse of the word.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:50.880]   But the fact that we are excessively checking our phones and using apps and using social
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.840]   media sites.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.960]   And so what the screen time function will do is it will tell you how many times a day
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.040]   you pick up your phone.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:03.120]   It will graph when those interactions happen.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.480]   It will monitor how much you use certain apps.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:12.360]   It can be used to set limits on each app so that after say an hour of Instagram it pops
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.240]   up and says, hey, you said you just want to limit yourself to an hour.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.440]   It's been an hour.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.400]   You can override that.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.440]   It also can put your phone in grayscale at certain times of the day to make it less appealing,
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.280]   kind of like the nighttime mode that we have now.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:34.880]   But it's interesting to me is a lot of different companies have received this feedback.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:40.520]   And I know -- you know, I mentioned Instagram and they have talked a lot about the fact that
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:45.560]   they know that they have to do better at helping their users to limit their time and just the
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.200]   black hole that you can get sucked into.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.760]   Anyone think that the screen time feature is going to significantly affect the way that
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:57.600]   we as a population excessively use our gadgets?
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.200]   I think it can help.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:10.400]   I do want to say, so psychologically speaking, there have been very real, very accurate comparisons
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:18.400]   between the effects of addiction to things like drugs, food addictions, things like that,
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:25.000]   and the addiction that folks can have to devices, to video games, to these things where
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.120]   right now people seem to be, oh, you know, they've got internet addiction, they've got
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.840]   phone addiction, they've got this, that and the other.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:36.360]   I think a lot of people will claim maybe that they are someone they know does, but there
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:42.160]   are real situations where that is a real thing and psychologically it looks the same as other
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.160]   forms of addiction that we've seen.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:50.480]   So I just -- I don't think that it is a good idea to sort of wipe that off and say, oh,
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.360]   no, you know, these addictions don't exist because we've proven that they do.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:02.520]   When it comes to these new screen time features, I think they're fascinating because you have
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:11.360]   to sort of open yourself up to being nannied a little bit by your device and being, I think,
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.400]   open-minded to letting it change your habits.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:19.080]   And if you find yourself sort of annoyed and you keep shutting it off, like it's not going
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   to work for you.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.400]   If you're constantly just saying, no, no, no, no, no, it's not going to work for you.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.040]   With screen time, I haven't done any active screen time effects.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:37.240]   I have gone in and turned it on and I've checked in to see how my usage is and it's pretty
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.040]   kind of horrifying to be honest.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.680]   >> What were your biggest surprises?
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:43.160]   >> How many times I picked up my device in a day.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.160]   That was the biggest thing.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.040]   I was like, I don't remember picking it up that many times.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:51.040]   This is not okay that I am, you know, lifting up this phone.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:55.880]   And what's cool is that it's so integrated with other parts of the operating system that
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:00.160]   if you set up in your clock, if you set up your bedtime, which is this feature where
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.760]   you set what time you want to go to bed, what time you want to wake up in the morning,
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.760]   and it will sort of let you know, hey, it's time to go to bed, then it'll play some music
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.120]   to wake you up and it does sleep tracking in between.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.000]   But if you set your bedtime, then screen time will also shame you.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.880]   It's like, hey, you picked up your device after your bedtime that you set.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.440]   Why were you doing that?
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:26.640]   So you just kind of can passively, I guess, more passively kind of confront these things,
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.480]   and then maybe they'll make you change, maybe they won't.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.080]   But I have not activated any of the active features.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:37.240]   And I think for me, that's because I'm sort of in this space where it's like, if I can't
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:42.680]   control myself without these things, then maybe I just don't even need to have the device.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:48.640]   Or it's just, I want to prove to myself that I can control my habits there.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:54.800]   And I have noticed a significant, or rather not noticed, I've made an active decision
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:00.560]   to be less active in certain apps and maybe pick up my phone less during the day.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.720]   But then I have this pesky thing on my wrist that lets me see things too.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.640]   So who knows how good I'm being.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:10.120]   Well, they say you can't change what you don't measure, right?
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:16.600]   That's the big CFO kind of comment about how you affect your behavior, how you affect
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.600]   your organizational behavior.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.560]   But Joanna Stern had an amazing column on this.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.080]   She's been testing it for a while.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   It was in the Wall Street Journal last week.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   And she said that what she just got in the habit of doing is whenever it told her she
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:33.320]   used enough of the device that she'd set a limit of say an hour or what have you, whenever
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.960]   it popped up that you hit the hour, she just hit ignore.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:41.760]   And that she realized it was just annoying her.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.360]   And she went to see a psychologist and he said, "That's because different parts of
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.800]   your brain are at work years.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.720]   We have the gas and the brakes, right?
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.720]   And we're not so great at the brakes right now when it comes to our devices."
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:00.120]   And our thinking brain is going to say, "I should only use this for an hour."
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:06.080]   But in that moment when you get a notification or you get a buzz on your wrist, your lizard
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.720]   brain says, "What's going on?"
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.920]   And those are two completely different sides of your brain.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:18.560]   And so this monitoring is not going to change you unless, as you said, Micah, you actively
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:24.120]   decide to use it as a tool and you have to, just the thing we suck at most as humans is
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.440]   self-discipline.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:30.800]   And so it's just, there's no device that's going to make self-discipline happen.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:35.160]   Other than maybe like an electric shock bracelet or something.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.120]   Let me circle around back to the first thing you said.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.880]   We all just give it applause for Apple saying that older devices are going to speed up now
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.640]   instead of slowing down the update.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.920]   Isn't that like something just so applaud?
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.960]   Like, I mean, really, think about that.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.080]   They actually wrote it down, which they don't write down how long the battery lasts, but
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.080]   they wrote down.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.520]   But this update is going to speed up the 6S plus.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.920]   Like, that was impressive.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   Apple, good job.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   So no longer are we slowing down phones, so you have to have to buy the new one.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.960]   We're going to speed up those O and for you broke, Pete would have...
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:09.400]   Oh, I don't know if he got dropped out and got censored because I think Apple realized
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.760]   he was on a rant.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.040]   Yeah, and using an emoji.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.280]   Yes, an emoji rant got shut down there.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.280]   But I think you're right.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:22.520]   It's good to notice the distinguishing factor here that we're not throttling.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.520]   We are going to speed up your old phones.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.600]   So a good point.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:32.600]   And as far as the time limit that it gives you, the same thing they did research on the
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.840]   watch because the watch will tell you to stand.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.640]   People would ignore it, the watch will tell you to work out, people would ignore it.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.360]   So the same thing is going to happen with this.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:45.800]   I'm most excited because on Tuesdays and Thursdays, my daughter is not allowed to watch YouTube
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.600]   and I usually have to log into her YouTube to make sure she doesn't do it.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:52.520]   So now I get to check her phone and notice she's not doing that.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:57.440]   But just to pro tip to people, I set this up for my buddy when it first came out because
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.160]   he wanted to make him an emoji.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.120]   And then he's like, "Oh, well, what else does the phone do?"
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.360]   A couple days later, I'm showing him stuff and I show him the thing.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.840]   And then Pornhub popped up.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.640]   And they spent seven minutes on Pornhub.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.640]   He's like, "What?"
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.120]   I was like, "You need to check this because this is where it reports.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:16.840]   You can find out everything you did, every webpage, every site, how long you was on the
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.840]   site.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.760]   So just be careful with this new update when you're out.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:26.000]   So I'm trying to share it with people and show them how to talk about Instagram.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.200]   And by the way, Instagram's saying they want to help minimize time people sweating on
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.040]   the wormhole.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.120]   I'm with you there.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.240]   I think that's hilarious and not true at all.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:42.520]   I do want to say I'm a big proponent of another feature that sort of ties into this
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.520]   screen time thing.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.520]   It's not screen time.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.160]   It's called do not disturb ball driving.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:53.480]   And this feature has actually existed for a while, but it kind of ties into this whole
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.920]   new sort of what we're paying attention to and when we are.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:02.160]   And I genuinely think that it can make a difference for folks because what do not disturb ball
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.120]   driving does is depending on how you set it up, you can set up to manual to where you
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   turn it on.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.480]   I don't recommend that feature because you won't turn it on automatic to where it uses
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:14.160]   your sensors so that it can tell when you're in the car and moving, then it's like, "Oh,
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.520]   yeah, you're probably in a car."
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.480]   Or it can use if you have a Bluetooth stereo system in your car, those have a special profile
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:25.040]   to let the device know, "Hey, I'm connecting to a car with Bluetooth," and then it will
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.040]   turn on.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:30.120]   In any case, what it does is it completely shuts down any notifications that you get
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.560]   while you're driving.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.040]   Your phone doesn't even light up.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:37.160]   And that's the important thing right there because lizard brain that's going, "I just
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.160]   got a buzz.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.160]   I got to see what it is."
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.040]   We have trouble not listening to that lizard brain.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.920]   We want to listen to that lizard brain.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:48.720]   And so if you aren't even presented with any sort of phone lighting up, any of that kind
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:53.880]   of thing, then you're just less likely to want to go and unsafely use your device while
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:58.280]   you're in traffic or driving around or what have you.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:04.680]   I'd like to think that I'm a good person who would never, ever look at my phone ever
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:11.240]   while I was in the car, but this feature helps make that a reality because I don't do it
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.840]   now because I don't see that there is a notification.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:18.040]   But in the past, it'd be like, "Oh, man, I saw somebody was tweeting at me.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.280]   Someone was sending me a message.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.280]   Someone was trying to call me.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:23.560]   I guess when I met this red light, I better go ahead and look at those."
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:29.040]   So I do think that there is some merit to these kinds of features if you let them work
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:35.800]   and if they kind of don't even give your lizard brain a chance to operate.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.600]   I think that's a really good use of it.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.320]   And I like that it gives you the option to do that.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.600]   It'd be nice if some of those things were a little bit more front loaded so you saw them
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.600]   as you were setting it up.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.040]   I got to get on that because I mean, I just am so bad.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.440]   Just while we were sitting here, my watch is going crazy.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.360]   And I'm like, "As a parent, I'm always worried, oh my gosh, what's going on with my
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.360]   kid?"
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:58.360]   And so I'm checking the thing and just so you guys know, she's making cinnamon bread
[00:59:58.360 --> 00:59:59.360]   at home.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.360]   So emergency dealt with.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.360]   Okay.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:09.680]   When you set up a new device, it does walk you through the driving feature.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.400]   I feel like that's something that definitely has saved lives.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.640]   I don't notice that on that.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.280]   I don't know what you're gonna add, but I know it's saved lives.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.840]   I remember a long time ago.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.280]   I think it was like the second or third iPhone I had, I was calling customer service and
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.880]   she's like, "Oh, do you want to call me back?"
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.880]   And I'm like, "Excuse me?"
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.880]   He's like, "You're driving, right?"
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.280]   And I'm like, "How did you know I'm driving?
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   I'm looking out the window."
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.080]   And she's like, "Oh, I can talk about faster moving."
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080]   And I'm like, "Oh, okay.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.240]   I'm gonna hang up now, big brother."
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.520]   And they should have had that feature a long time ago.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.320]   I feel like if nothing else, with it not lighting up is where it helps you.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.200]   Like, if I set my timer for Instagram and I said, "No more Instagram after an hour,"
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.400]   and it did me like an adult and said, "No more Instagram," and I went to go to Instagram
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.160]   and it just wouldn't load until the next time I said, that would help me.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.040]   But the fact that I could just hit ignore and keep going in doesn't stop me.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.280]   But that driving feature is vastly important.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.480]   And I like the fact that they're doing that.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.000]   And again, when you set up your phone, a new phone, going forward, it should prompt you
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.960]   to that in the setup.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:16.320]   One thing that the screen time features will have that provides that kind of shutdown feature
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:22.440]   is if you're setting up a phone and you indicate that it's a child's phone, you can get more
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:31.840]   control now through Apple's internal controls, as opposed to a third-party app, to shut down
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.920]   YouTube, shut down Instagram or Snap.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.960]   So the parental controls have been beefed up.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.040]   They have, again, a nighttime mode so that you can turn it off at certain times.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.280]   This is a long time coming and it's kind of embarrassing.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   I think that this is just now something that Apple is offering.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.000]   It has not been something that you can do in the past and they've made it really difficult
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   for parents.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.680]   And I think this is going to help.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:06.520]   I still think that the Disney Circle product is probably the best option for parents in
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:12.760]   terms of shutting things down on a sort of house-wide aspect because it can control
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.880]   your Xbox, your computers, your phones.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:22.120]   You get the subscription service, it can control your phone when your kid is outside the house.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.120]   Oh, wow.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.640]   So that, I think, is probably the best option.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:33.440]   And granted, full disclosure, I was hosting a panel for them down at Mobile World Congress
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.320]   Americas last week and got to know the features of it a little bit better and especially
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.880]   their integration with T-Mobile now.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.200]   But I think that that, it's kind of surprising to me that Apple is only just getting to these
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:52.600]   parental controls and that they aren't offering even more of a whole home solution because
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.800]   this is a major pain point for parents.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.040]   I mean, everybody I talk to, you go to any party with parents and they just tear their
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:05.160]   heads out, hands hair out about how much conflict is in their home around gadgets.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.280]   How surprised are you when it's dual SIM cards?
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   I mean, come on.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.200]   It's what Apple does.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.320]   They wait four years to tell you that they invented something that you grabbed my head
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.560]   and then they make you feel good about it.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.760]   That's what Apple does.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.200]   So, you know, this is what it is.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:29.480]   Just back to the screen time, a couple of the things I wanted to mention that Google
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.640]   has this.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:37.280]   They have the well-being app, so it's not just Apple.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.480]   And one other thing that I'm seeing in the chat room, you keep mentioning and I just
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.680]   wanted to circle back on this before we finish all Apple talk.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.640]   Oh, Dr., you keep talking about dual SIM cards.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:53.760]   So my understanding of this one feature that was brought out for the iPhone is that it
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.840]   will allow you to have two phone numbers.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:03.520]   One, physical SIM card, one e-SIM card, except in China where it will have two SIM card slots
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.480]   because e-SIM cards are illegal there.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.200]   Anybody have anything they want to add on this?
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   Why this is a value?
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.720]   I don't really totally understand it except for international travel.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.120]   I mean, you wouldn't -- I know most people, a lot of people that I work with, they have
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.600]   a work phone that's provided by their employer and then they have a personal phone.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.640]   And I don't think this solves that problem because you don't want to commingle the data
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.720]   on your phone, right?
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.600]   So any other use cases that I'm not thinking of this for this?
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.240]   I was assuming that that was the problem being solved.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.880]   So that actually functionally wouldn't work.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.080]   I guess now that you're describing it, I see that.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.680]   Yeah, I couldn't think of any other reason.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.600]   So the way they say it is you're going to be able to know which number and which line
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.160]   are coming in.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:54.440]   For my criminal activities, I use my LG G7 ThinQ, which allows me to have T-Mobile digits
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:59.800]   so I can have two phones on it and an additional imaginary SIM.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.200]   I'm doing air quotes right here, the e-SIM or whatever it is.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.720]   So there's definitely a lot of usage for it.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.600]   It just depends on what you're using it for.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:12.360]   I'm not going to curate myself any further, but I'm going to say that it is a useful thing,
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.560]   especially when you just also, okay, so you're Becky, right?
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.840]   You want to go out, maybe you want to talk somebody, but you want to give them your real
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.840]   number.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.080]   It wouldn't be nice to have this backup number that still comes to your cell phone, that
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.240]   you could get calls with, you could block them, and you know it's not your personal
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.120]   number that you have for 14 years.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.160]   I mean, there's a whole bunch of case scenarios for it.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.720]   We don't have time to break it all down right now.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.720]   If you look for some criminal underprisons, just tweet me at o.gov.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.200]   That's our next podcast, clearly criminal activities for the Tech News.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:50.760]   I'll just agree that this definitely was a head scratcher for me, but I can see for
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:56.720]   some folks who for whatever reason might need two different numbers, then it's available
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.720]   to them.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:05.120]   Yeah, I guess if you did a lot of international travel, we talked to Jeremy Burge from Emojipedia
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.960]   on the Clockwise podcast earlier this week, and he had mentioned that he's in the US quite
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:17.200]   a bit, and the way that our system is set up, it's very difficult to keep a number here
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.320]   without it getting shut down after a while.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.280]   To be able to bounce back and forth between those two is very helpful for him.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:32.120]   I've heard a lot of complaints about doing partial ECIM, and then the actual physical
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:38.760]   card, and why Apple didn't just do the one that has two physical cards everywhere.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:45.240]   And I think it's fascinating because we have this sort of struggle, power struggle a little
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.080]   bit between the carriers in the United States and the phone makers in the United States,
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:57.600]   and to do ECIMs makes it a lot easier for people to switch between carriers, and carriers
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.920]   aren't big on that idea.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.880]   So the physical sim makes it a little bit more difficult, and I don't know.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.640]   Again, I don't do enough switching.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:13.080]   I've been on AT&T for a bajillion years, so it doesn't really matter to me.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.280]   In the chatroom, TrustNoOne says, "If it works like Google's work profiles, the data
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:22.560]   is separated, two of the same apps, one is the work app, one is the personal app, and
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.600]   there's an indicator to tell which one and the apps are separated in the app drawer is
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.600]   working personally."
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:34.480]   But I think if going back to O-Dokta, he says, "Why, if you're trying to really create
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:38.600]   a wall between those two worlds, it doesn't feel that comfortable."
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   So we'll be...
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.720]   And somebody was trying to explain to me, they were using like, XFINITY servers with
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:48.960]   Google Fi, and they were using one for data and one for their minutes, and I was like,
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.480]   "Okay, because they're using T-Mobile digits."
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:56.200]   There's a lot of applications for people that want to use it to find a good use for it.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:01.560]   That's why they're finally implementing it in 2018.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:08.120]   The chatroom also wants me to let everyone know that O-Dokta is still in Memoji form,
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:15.040]   and that they've now called this Memoji Babyface Stone this week in criminal activity.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.040]   [laughter]
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.040]   I appreciate that.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040]   I appreciate that.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.840]   I've been doing some face care.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.840]   You know what I mean?
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.840]   I like that.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.840]   It's looking fresh.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.840]   Looking fresh.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.840]   Looking fresh.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:28.840]   You know what it is.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.440]   You know, you're going to start a YouTube channel with your skincare routine, get your
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.440]   makeup going.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.440]   That's how we do it.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.440]   Okay, do Troutina, call me.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.640]   Call me, do Troutina.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:46.680]   On that note, we're going to take a break and come back a really deep, deep look at Facebook
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:54.080]   and Mark Zuckerberg from The New Yorker and Evan Osnows, who has a history of really bringing
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.640]   out some details that are surprising.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.480]   We're going to dig into that after this break, and Leo.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.560]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.560]   Love Stamps.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.720]   How many years have we been using this?
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.600]   Must be at least 10.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.400]   We use Stamps.com because we send stuff out, right?
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.240]   Checks, brochures, mailing stuff.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.160]   We mail people bobbleheads and pheasas, all sorts of stuff.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.640]   We mail the host microphone, all that stuff.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.920]   If you're doing mailing of any kind, you really need Stamps.com.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.880]   Stamps.com does everything you can do.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:30.600]   All the amazing services of the post office at your desk.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.920]   I'm not talking about postage meter.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.760]   You use your computer, your printer, that's it, and the Stamps.com site.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.360]   You can buy and print official U.S. postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.880]   The mail carrier comes and picks it up.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   You don't have to get up.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.600]   Well, maybe you have to get up to open the door, get a cup of coffee, but that's it.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.640]   Love Stamps.com.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.600]   It makes you look really professional too because it can print right on envelopes.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.600]   Your logo, your return address automatically filled in.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:07.800]   It'll pick up the recipient's address from your address book, or whatever you use.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:13.000]   If you're a seller like on Amazon or Etsy or eBay, it'll pick it up there, put it on
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   the label.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.720]   It'll even recommend ways to save money with more affordable mail classes.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.240]   They send you a digital scale, so you always have exactly the right postage, no more extra
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.560]   stamps just in case.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:33.840]   And stamps don't, I mean, licking and putting a stamp on, it's much nicer with the label
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.480]   and the QR code and everything.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.040]   It really looks good.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.400]   I think the post office likes it because they can process it automatically means that
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.200]   your package gets there faster.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.360]   Click print mail and you're done.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.680]   No equipment to lease, no long term commitment, just stamps.com.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680]   Look, you got to do this.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.080]   Go to stamps.com.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.440]   Use Twit for our special offer and it's very simple.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.280]   Up in the upper right hand corner, see the kind of silver radio microphone.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:06.520]   Click that and or Twit, you'll get up to $55 in free postage.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.720]   That's nice, right?
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.960]   You get that digital scale I mentioned a four week trial.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   Don't wait.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960]   Do it right now.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:17.040]   Where you forget, you probably already said, oh yeah, I should do this like last month.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.040]   Do it now.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:22.240]   Stamps.com, click the radio microphone at the top of the homepage and her Twit.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.760]   That's stamps.com offer code Twit.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.120]   Then you never have to get up from your desk again.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.880]   Oh look, Becky did not get up from our desk.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.480]   She's here with the rest of Twit.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.480]   Thanks, Becky.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:40.400]   Oh yeah, I've just been sitting here licking stamps the old fashioned way.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.760]   If only I'd had some stamps.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:52.520]   I am back here this week in tech and we have one fantastic audience member here and he
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:56.280]   has really helped informed me.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:03.920]   Jitash says that in Asia, a lot of people have dual sims because they get better data
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:08.320]   rates with one carrier and then they might have better long distance rates depending on
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.600]   what country they call most.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.760]   He says 90 to 95 percent of the people in Singapore and Hong Kong have multiple sims
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.320]   just for that reason.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.880]   It's so great to have a live studio audience member who can inform me of these important
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.880]   things.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880]   Our audience members are always so knowledgeable.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.360]   That's what's so intimidating for me.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.840]   Filament and for Leo.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.480]   The audience is so amazingly knowledgeable.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.440]   You just don't want to be a total ding dong up here.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.840]   Luckily, I have three great panelists with me.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:40.680]   Brian McCullough is here from the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.840]   Mike Asargent from Mobile Nations and O-Dr. Owen J. J. Stone.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:46.840]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.840]   O-Dr.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.280]   I'm Kimsey.com has all my podcasts.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.280]   I did a couple of tech podcasts.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.280]   Talk about the stuff we've been talking about this week.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280]   So I'm Kimsey.com.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.080]   That's where you can find me out in the world.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.080]   Excellent.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:04.360]   Well, we're going to move on to the interface of social media and politics and culture and
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.400]   society, which could fill an entire podcast in and of itself.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:14.360]   The news, Facebook this week, said it's going to use technology and human monitors to look
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:23.680]   at pictures that contain text that may be fake news or in violation of their policies.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:30.200]   In the past, it's been very difficult to report a picture because they didn't have any reporting
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.920]   tools to flag those pictures that fit into any of these categories.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:40.600]   And as a result, a lot of the fake news propaganda that's been pushed aside in text form, there
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:44.120]   has been a rising up of using photos for this.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:51.080]   So now they've got optical character recognition and some AI that's going to look at what is
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:57.920]   being said in text over these pictures to determine if it fits any of the fake news or
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:01.560]   propaganda that they're trying to squelch on the site.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:09.360]   It's called Rosetta and it's an internal program that just kind of pushes the ball down the
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.800]   hill that says Facebook is looking at this issue.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:19.600]   Brian, I know you talked a lot about Facebook's problems in this space and what Mark Zuckerberg
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.280]   wrote as they say they're preparing for the upcoming elections.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:27.000]   And I just want to quote a couple of things he said in this article in The New Yorker
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.920]   that Evanosnos wrote.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:35.440]   It was basically the concept is Ken Mark Zuckerberg fixed Facebook before Facebook breaks democracy.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:41.200]   And what Zuckerberg said in his post, "I'm bringing the same focus and rigor to addressing
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.880]   election interference that I've brought to previous product challenges like shifting
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.880]   our services to mobile."
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.360]   These issues, the election issues are even harder because people don't agree on what
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.880]   a good outcome looks like or what trade-offs are acceptable to make.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:59.800]   And I think this really signifies what he thinks Facebook's job is.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:04.800]   Our responsibility is to amplify the good and mitigate the harm.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.280]   Does he get it Brian?
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.640]   Well, you know, actually what I talked about this week in regards to this piece, I'm going
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.760]   to take off that and go in a different direction.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:21.560]   That specifically the politics stuff, that's what I think this piece illuminates is that
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.000]   that's the classic engineers idea that if we just get enough smart people in a room
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.600]   and get some smart math together, we can solve this problem.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:39.280]   And so if he's seeing, rightfully so, that the political aspect, the propaganda aspect
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.760]   is a problem that they didn't anticipate or maybe they should have anticipated, but they
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.560]   didn't do enough to fix at the beginning.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:53.200]   What I found fascinating about this New Yorker piece is that I can see that Zuckerberg gets
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.200]   that stuff.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.680]   Again, it's the engineer's mindset of, "Oh, you've told me there's a problem.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:04.480]   You told me that this aspect of the product is performing 30% sub-optimally.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.380]   How do we fix it?"
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:06.920]   That sort of thing.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:14.960]   What I found fascinating about this New Yorker piece is it's rare, you know, they always
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:18.280]   try out CEOs to do these profiles.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.520]   You know they don't want to do it.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.000]   Evan even says at the beginning, "You could tell by his body like you didn't want to do
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   it."
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.880]   But it's innate of saying, "We get it.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:27.880]   Heard you.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.880]   I'm human.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.560]   I'm a nice guy."
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.640]   That sort of thing.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:37.960]   What I thought that this piece illuminated is Zuckerberg feels like he can solve problems
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.000]   that are brought to his attention that are categorizable, that have metrics and things
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.840]   like that.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:50.160]   But I thought that this was an amazing profile of the best I've seen of Zuckerberg in years
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:57.680]   because Evan Osnost took this authorial position of, "There's a trope in literature
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:02.240]   that's about the boy king that's been brought up inside the castle.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:09.640]   Now he has to lead so he has to understand how the outside world actually functions."
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:14.280]   I feel like that this piece had a little bit of that in the sense or a lot of that really
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.920]   in the sense that Zuckerberg is not a dumb guy.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.400]   No one's ever accused him of that.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.520]   So he's smart enough to realize that he is in a bubble to a certain extent.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:28.320]   He created this company in '21, '22.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:34.080]   He's been filthy rich, world famous for this whole time that Facebook's been around.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.120]   There's no one that's hired that he doesn't sign off on.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:42.240]   There's even a quote from Cheryl Sandberg in there where he'll say sometimes in front
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.600]   of the company, "Well, I've never worked anywhere else, but Cheryl tells me."
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:53.480]   So Zuckerberg is aware that there are things that he knows he doesn't know, that he knows
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:56.560]   he doesn't grok is maybe a better way of saying it.
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.320]   The question that this piece in my mind brings out is, "Is that enough?"
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.920]   I mean, thank God that he's self-aware.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.760]   Thank God that he knows he needs to learn things outside his bubble.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:14.600]   He's always made a show of trying to improve himself, but also maybe learning what you
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:20.520]   don't know isn't taking a media crew around the country and going to people's houses and
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.800]   having dinner with them.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.240]   Oh, yeah, posting those photos for...
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:33.320]   I think that, yes, thank God that they're taking the steps that they're taking to address
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.920]   the political stuff, they're getting out there ahead of it.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.360]   Let's hope that they're doing all the right things right now.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:46.360]   But I thought that this piece was more fascinating because it sort of revealed Zuckerberg's bubble
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:52.600]   in a way that no piece had done before, especially with the Roman Emperor stuff, which I'm going
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.560]   to quit talking now, but if you want to...
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.880]   Yeah, I want you to explain that a little bit because we'll get back to that.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:04.120]   He named his daughter August after Augustus, and it really indicates his perception of
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:10.040]   what his role is in not just society, but in history and in the long scope of history
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.800]   that the future.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.720]   This is exactly the point that I made on the show this week.
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:22.520]   First of all, there were 70 odd Roman emperors depending on how you count.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:27.320]   There were maybe four good ones in terms of being good, effective rulers.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.880]   The majority were psychopaths, actual psychopaths, and a lot of them were psychopaths before
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.280]   they became emperor.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:39.520]   But a lot of them became psychopaths because they had unlimited power and were basically
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:45.440]   gods on earth that had life or death power over everyone in their realms.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.000]   So in a piece where we're trying to say, "Hey, I'm Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   I'm a nice guy.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   I'm a human.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.120]   I'm trying to learn the things that I don't know."
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:20:00.040]   And also, I'm trying to assure the public that yes, me, this unelected emperor of my quasi-nation
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:03.240]   state that has two billion citizens in it.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:08.440]   By the way, I really hero worship the emperor Augustus who, aside from Julius Caesar, is
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.240]   really the guy that brought down the Roman Republic.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.680]   >> Bager disconnect, didn't land.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.360]   >> Yeah, right.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:19.520]   >> That's not one that's like, I love Beyonce too.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.520]   You know?
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.720]   >> You should have done that.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.520]   >> I know, I wouldn't just land it so much better.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:32.240]   But it gives you a sense of the scope that he perceives his role in society, the world,
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.680]   the future, history.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:40.840]   And some of the comparative stats that were brought out blew my mind and maybe he's right.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.120]   This is a couple of things.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.640]   If Facebook were a country, it would have the largest population on earth, where the
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:52.080]   2.2 billion people, about a third of humanity, log in at least once a month, I think they
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:57.520]   said at one point that Facebook has as many adherents as Christianity.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.480]   >> More, more.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:03.240]   >> Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:08.960]   And so he sees himself at this scale and he might be right.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:16.880]   And I would say that the central issue as he places himself and Facebook in the world
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:22.600]   and in the political environment that we're in right now is, is Facebook going to be a
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.960]   decider of truth?
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:30.800]   Or are they going to be a venue for truth to be discussed and what is truth?
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:38.920]   And I think what was said that really spoke to me is that, let me see if I can get that
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.920]   this quote.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:47.040]   It had to do, it was the central issue about if he had to choose truth, I'm going to find
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.040]   it for you.
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.040]   Hold on a second.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.480]   I mean, I just, the whole Alex, oh, here it is.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:56.380]   Between speech and truth, he chose speech.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:00.440]   Between speed and perfection, he chose speed.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.960]   Between scale and safety, he chose scale.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:08.760]   And that's the takeaway that Evanos knows has at the end of this really deep look at
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.800]   Facebook and Zuckerberg and the problems we have right now.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.640]   I think the deed has been done.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.880]   There's, I don't know.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.080]   Is there a fix?
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.280]   Cricket.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:27.240]   I could go in, I could go again, but I wanted other people to jump in.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:36.880]   I honestly, I don't have much to say on this because I think that we have reached a place
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:45.800]   where it's like what can we do with this site to, or even like with the internet in general,
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:54.480]   and more importantly with human beings because I think that we underestimate the level at
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:02.720]   which, I can't think of the term right now, but the level at which we have trouble accepting
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:08.960]   new ideas and we have trouble letting those base beliefs and understandings that we have
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.440]   change.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:18.920]   And because of that, and we've created this, this, you know, online place where election
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:25.280]   tampering can happen because a group can come in and sort of put out these ideas that
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:30.160]   they know are going to upset a certain group and then also feed into another group, that
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:36.600]   is because of our evolutionary history and the way that we, going back to the lizard
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:41.640]   brain, the way that we think, like, and I have to give so many of these props to Georgia
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:46.920]   Dow who's been on this week and tech before because much of this comes from her.
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.640]   She's a psychotherapist.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:54.560]   And historically, we lived in these little tribes and it was very important for us to
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:24:00.520]   see what was ours and what was others and our beliefs and the things that we did, they
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.320]   kept us safe and the things that others did.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.640]   We wouldn't want to be a part of those because they wouldn't keep us safe.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:12.040]   And at our very base level brain, because we lived so many years like that, we still
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.040]   feel that way.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.760]   We still think that way.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.320]   And so it's difficult.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:22.880]   It's almost like an actual literal pain for us to change our base beliefs, to be open-minded,
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.200]   to experience change, to be open to new ideas.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:34.360]   And we have just created this thing where connections can happen so quickly and to get
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.440]   so many people.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.280]   And it's like two things that come together at once.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.280]   We've got all these connections happening and so many people being able to see things
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.480]   all at once.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:49.480]   But then we also have this thing where humans aren't realizing that the people behind, you
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:54.600]   know, these usernames or these profile photos or what have you are actual literal human
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.640]   beings.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.200]   We have this disconnect.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:03.080]   And so all this can come together to let us spill out the most disgusting parts of ourselves
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:08.840]   and really feel hatred and badness and all of these things.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.640]   And then we take those and they become a part of us in our daily lives and we use that
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:18.360]   to influence how we feel about other people and the way that we think about other people.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:25.960]   So if you tuned out onto everything I just said, the TL, Simecole and DR is, I think
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:32.240]   that we are not, I don't know what it's going to take to fix it because I think that it's
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.240]   already broken.
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:38.240]   And I think that until we look at things from a psychological perspective and from a human-centered
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.840]   perspective, we're not going to get anything done.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.840]   Totally agree.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.120]   And I feel like very few people have had their minds changed because of something that was
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.440]   posted on social media.
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:55.920]   And yet one counter narrative and an analogy that I can see is that Facebook is like,
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.760]   Facebook in the most recent election is like airports and 9/11.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:07.840]   And that after 9/11 we changed the security in our airports because we wanted to at least,
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.720]   we couldn't change everything with that, but at least we could stop weaponizing planes.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:19.600]   And so are these steps to change Facebook and to down rank things that are perceived
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.800]   of as fake news or polarizing?
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:29.040]   Is that the equivalent of trying to make social media less weaponized?
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.280]   And is it at least worth fighting the fight?
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.240]   And I think the answer is yes.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.160]   Does it solve all the problems?
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   Absolutely not.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.320]   Should they have been aware in advance?
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.320]   Probably.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:43.520]   Here we are and you got to do something.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.440]   And whether or not he's going to do enough is the question.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.120]   And this profile left me uncertain.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:56.080]   I know why he did what Facebook did in the past, but I don't know what they're going
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.920]   to do in the future.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:07.400]   But see, this brings me back to the whole concept of Zuckerberg is aware that he's in
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:13.520]   a bubble of his own making, that he's hired the team that he wants, that he's making the
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.680]   product that he wants.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:23.120]   So the question is, is he the qualified, in a weird way, is he the qualified person to
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.560]   make those changes?
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:35.640]   If seemingly he's not capable of being aware of how these things work for lack of a better
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.120]   word, normal people.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.120]   You know what I mean?
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:44.400]   Like Ben Thompson in Stratecary wrote this week that his concern is not that Zuckerberg
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:51.440]   believes that Facebook is a force for good, rather that he probably maybe doesn't even
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:54.360]   consider that it might not be a force for good.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.360]   You know what I mean?
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:01.400]   He refuses to maybe even allow himself to go there.
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:10.840]   When you were talking about that quote of choosing scale over safety, speech over truth,
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:11.840]   right?
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:18.360]   So he, Osmo finishes that by saying that at a certain point, the habits of mind that
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:22.840]   serves Zuckerberg well on his ascent will start to work against him.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.280]   So far he's convinced himself he can solve problem after problem, no matter the howling,
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.520]   the public may cause.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:33.320]   And this is the key point, Osmo says that Zuckerberg is going to have to embrace the
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:37.280]   fact that he's now a protector of the peace, not a disruptor of it.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.680]   And I'm bringing it back to that being the boy king analogy.
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:46.800]   If you're William the Conqueror and you take over England in 1066, great, you've moved
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.440]   fast and broken things.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:53.920]   But then what the people that you now rule want you to do is not break a bunch of other
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:54.920]   stuff.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.120]   They want you to bring them peace and prosperity.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:04.280]   So does he have the mindset and the tools to win the peace, to make us all feel comfortable
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:10.480]   and wealthy and profitable and happy as opposed to, hey, here's a new feature that can do
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.840]   this thing that you never thought of.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.120]   Like in a way, the skill set that Facebook and Zuckerberg have to have now is keeping
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.240]   us fat and happy, not like wowing us with new stuff maybe.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:25.200]   >> And I think one thing that underscores that point is a piece of news that came out
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:30.440]   this week about Alex Jones and all of his channels being taken down from the various
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:39.160]   social media platforms and the iTunes store, which was basically that Mark Zuckerberg admitted
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:41.640]   that they weren't sure what to do.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:49.280]   And it wasn't until Apple pulled all of Alex Jones material out of the podcast and iTunes
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:53.560]   store that Facebook felt like, okay, now we can do it.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:59.600]   And maybe to your point, what this says is that they're not leaders and they can't lead
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.000]   on this.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.040]   And I just don't know who's going to help them.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.960]   Are they going to follow Apple?
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.400]   Who are they going to follow?
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:12.640]   It's- >> Brendan, I read on the podcast, Brendan
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.200]   and I have tweeted that the problem is too many tech types fail to differentiate between
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:21.240]   technical problems and social challenges that can't be engineered away.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.600]   And he says that Bill Gates has moved up the learning curve on this, but most of his colleagues
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.440]   have not.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:35.240]   It could be, I mean, so how long has Cheryl been there at least a decade right?
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:40.680]   And Facebook's what, 15 years old almost?
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.360]   There was a time when they shook things up at Microsoft.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:50.320]   There was a time when Bill Gates took a step back and handed the reins to Steve Bomer, which
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.560]   we know how that didn't go so well.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:57.720]   >> But you could say, you could also point to Travis Kalanek and Uber and him pulling
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:01.200]   back and bringing a kinder softer more.
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:06.600]   >> Is this the time for Facebook to do a real shake up, bring in some new blood and
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.560]   like literal generational blood?
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:11.640]   Again, Facebook's almost 15 years old.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.640]   How old is Zuckerberg now?
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:13.800]   He was born in '84.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:21.400]   So if maybe bring in, and this might even aid them in terms of young people don't use
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.160]   the main Facebook app anymore, they're using Instagram for sure.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.280]   But so maybe bring in some young blood, bring in a new generation.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.600]   Again, I'm using Microsoft as an example.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.040]   They did that stuff, especially in the 90s.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:39.840]   They brought in that Generation X generation that came in after the Gateses and the bombers
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.840]   and stuff that ran things in the 90s.
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:47.000]   And maybe this is that time for Facebook.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.560]   >> With that, we are going to take a quick break and come back to discuss, there was
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.280]   other news this week because it's actually Facebook.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:59.080]   We had a little bit of Google news and some really interesting decisions on policy that
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.280]   may affect us all and how the internet works.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.560]   So we're going to hear from Leo and be right back.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:10.000]   >> I always love doing the Blue Apron ads on Twitter because I always go home after
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.720]   Twitter and make dinner and we get Blue Apron every week.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:17.280]   So that usually is three meals a week, almost always Sunday after Twitter.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.200]   I get to cook a great meal.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.680]   And I love it because I've been busy all day doing shows.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:23.680]   I don't have to shop.
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:24.680]   I don't have to meal plan.
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:25.960]   I just get home.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:29.440]   We've already picked what we're going to get from Blue Apron on the website.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:35.280]   They have a menu with 12 new recipes every week, always innovative and interesting.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.720]   So it's actually the hard thing.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.960]   So that one or that, oh, that looks good, pick two, three or four for every week.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:42.400]   So we get three a week.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.880]   I get home, it's there.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:44.880]   It's ready to go.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:50.560]   It's like I have a sous chef, exactly the right pre-portioned ingredients, fresh.
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.800]   I've never seen better looking produce and meat.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.200]   It's fantastic.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:57.360]   It's seasonally inspired and the recipe card's right there.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:02.240]   Forty five minutes after I get home, it's going to be done and everybody's going to be so
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:05.600]   happy because it fills the house with this amazing smell.
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:09.800]   It's so fun to cook for your family.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.320]   It's a great help with back to school.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:17.320]   It's kids love it, by the way, cook with your kids in Blue Apron.
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.480]   They're doing the meal prep for you.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.040]   It's like having a little sous chef in a box.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.440]   Blue Apron offers a range of recipes.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:26.440]   All of them, I promise you, bursting with flavor.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.800]   Whether you're looking for a quick and easy meal or a full culinary cooking experience,
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.640]   you get to choose on the website.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.800]   There are a huge range of options.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:41.240]   You check out, I love this, they're menu for chef design recipes and they do these partnerships
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:42.240]   that make it fun.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:46.320]   There's always something new like the Bob's Burger inspired, crispy chicken tenders and
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:51.480]   mashed potatoes with butter, lettuce and ranch dressing, pasta and creamy tomato sauce with
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.000]   summer vegetables.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.680]   What do you cook in the night?
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:56.680]   It ought to be Blue Apron.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:58.360]   It'll be the best meal ever.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.360]   Check out this week's menu.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.280]   Get your first three meals free.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:03.720]   Blueapron.com/twit.
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:10.720]   For your first three meals free and get cooking, you're going to know, oh, it smells so good.
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:13.440]   Mmm, I can smell it right now.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:16.640]   Blueapron.com/twit.
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:19.400]   Blue Apron is a better way to cook.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.120]   Back to Becky Worley and this week in tech.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:28.120]   A couple of times ago when I was on Twit with Leo, Leo was here hosting, after the show,
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:34.520]   we went and he and Lisa made dinner for my family and I and they are a good cook.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:39.240]   So I have to say, Blue Apron, like in it, got some bad news.
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.600]   Oh, doctor, lost power.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:45.800]   Somebody hit a power pole near his house.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.760]   No power, power's out.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:52.840]   So one of you guys is going to have to step up and be the ranting guest.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.080]   So just pick your rant.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.200]   Whatever you need to do.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.400]   If you need a Memoji for it, that's fine.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.400]   Yeah, right.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.400]   Let me get that done.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:06.920]   I got to lose my like perky morning television, good morning America persona and get my rant
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.120]   on if I'm going to step in for the great O'Dokta.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:14.840]   But yeah, there was other news this week.
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.840]   Some a couple of interesting things.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:20.920]   I want to talk a little bit about Alphabet's project, Loon.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:27.800]   This is Google Alphabet's project to use balloons to create wireless networks.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.800]   Past a big milestone this week, they use seven balloons in the stratosphere.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:36.120]   They spread out a signal over 620 square miles.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.880]   The idea is not super new.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.040]   They're bringing wireless data to areas that don't have the infrastructure to create good
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.080]   data networks.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:47.640]   And Facebook has done this before.
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:51.480]   There have been planes and solar powered planes where people thought they could do this to
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:55.080]   create internet access in places where it's limited.
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:57.720]   And we always think, oh, everybody has internet.
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.120]   Not so much.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:03.560]   And where I think this is really interesting is that Project Loon was deployed in Puerto
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:06.400]   Rico after Hurricane Maria.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:13.000]   And they had to get an FCC temporary license to go in and provide this.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.600]   They worked with T-Mobile and Verizon.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:24.000]   And as we're watching the Hurricane Florence hit the Carolinas right now, really interesting
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000]   uses of technology going on.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.720]   We've seen next door the social network for neighborhoods be incredibly powerful for people
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:36.400]   who have emergency needs.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:41.840]   And it's amazing how people do manage to keep connected and whether they have a cell signal
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:44.640]   or somehow still have Wi-Fi in some way, shape or form.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.800]   It does happen even in these major storms.
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.360]   Another one that's really interesting, I was listening to Zellow.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.360]   Have you guys ever used that before?
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360]   No, I've heard of it.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.560]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:02.680]   It uses, it can work with incredibly low bandwidth on your cell signal.
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:09.600]   And it's kind of like a CB radio where they have channels that are articulated for a topic.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:14.400]   So they have a bunch of different Hurricane Florence channels, including one for the Cajun
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:21.040]   Navy where people are monitoring and if you need help and can sign on to the app, you
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:27.000]   can state your location and ask for information to be relayed to 911 if you for some reason
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   can't reach 911.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.560]   Right, I actually think that it was last year's hurricane cycle that that app really
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.440]   took off in Texas.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:39.040]   If I remember correctly, if I'm talking about the exact same app, that's when it took off
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:40.840]   was the last big hurricane.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.840]   What's the push to talk functionality, right?
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.360]   Yeah, it's just like that.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:51.160]   And I mean, the thing is, is these 911 dispatches get totally overwhelmed or people don't have
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.760]   the ability to call.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.800]   And so these low bandwidth apps actually are really helpful as they're trying to communicate
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.800]   with other people.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.480]   It's called Zellow.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:05.760]   And then another one that was from, I think it was Harvey as well, Brian, was it's called
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.920]   crowd rescue.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:13.440]   And this lets people who need to be rescued, a lot of times it's the slow rising waters
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:20.160]   and people are trapped and then they can put their location on them and they can indicate
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:27.680]   where they are and then volunteers who have boats or trucks or whatever can try and get
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.680]   at them.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:35.040]   And so it's one of those places where you see technology and free markets and the existing
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:41.920]   sort of device infrastructure that we have working when you can't rely on, you know,
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.320]   there's just not enough first responders to help everybody.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.720]   So it's always good as we rant to talk about something good.
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:55.160]   Feature idea for the iPhone 2020 as I'm calling it is a flare that shoots out.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.520]   You may be only have one or two, but like, since we don't have the headphone jack anymore
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:03.320]   or whatever, like put a put a put a another little hole in there and it shoots out a flare
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.320]   if you're in danger.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.600]   Well, if you turn on parent mode, then the kid wouldn't be able to access that feature.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.600]   Right.
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.360]   It could be a disaster, right?
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:16.960]   Or if it's maybe if it's the galaxy note, it shoots the pen out and the panic.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:17.960]   Exactly.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:20.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.120]   That's fantastic.
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:25.640]   You know, but there is one interesting thing that I wondered about and I know this sounds
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:32.160]   crazy, but have you guys that that fire chat is another app that it came out of came a
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:38.880]   burning man, I think, where there was so much pressure on the cell signals that they couldn't
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.080]   actually get a message through.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:44.960]   So it created these mesh networks through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connecting up to other
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.160]   phones who had the app running and they relayed messages to other people in the network.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.240]   And I thought, man, I wonder what it would take.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:58.480]   And I mean, I'm sure it has major security issues, but for that to be built into the
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:05.760]   operating systems that you could somehow create a mesh network if you wanted to with other
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.600]   phones without having to be a pre-installed app, because that's the thing about this is
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.280]   like who pre-installed an app for when you're in a disaster and you don't think about it.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:18.480]   So that you can talk to your neighbor or whatever.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:24.520]   But there's already some of that sort of close up functionality that exists between your
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.600]   iPhone and your Mac and your iPad and how they can all communicate with each other using
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:31.360]   Bluetooth and Wi-Fi direct connect stuff.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:32.360]   So it wouldn't be.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.360]   Air drop, right?
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:41.200]   So you had sort of like airdrop chat where everyone could work together in those kinds
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:42.200]   of situations.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:43.800]   I think that's a pretty cool idea.
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:49.440]   And Apple being so focused on encryption and security, I imagine they'd figure out
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:54.040]   a way to try and make that happen without there being those security issues.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:41:00.320]   One more little weather item that I thought was kind of interesting is the Weather Channel
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:10.560]   did an amazing graphic, 3D graphic showing what the water rising numbers actually mean
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.240]   in real life.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:17.080]   So hopefully we'll have this posted, but it's on Wired posted.
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:20.400]   It's also in the Weather Channel's Twitter feed.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:26.680]   But basically they had this entire green screen room and they did an animation.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:32.600]   It's like if you scroll forward to like a minute into the animation, it shows the meteorologist
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:37.320]   standing kind of doing like a standard, you know, here's where the rain's going to come.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:43.840]   But then it's like a carved out semi circle around her and the backdrop is this 3D graphic
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:47.880]   of a car and a street and a house and trees.
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:53.400]   And you see the water rising behind her and you realize, oh, scary.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:42:00.280]   I mean, it's like the day after kind of scary, you realize, wow, the power of water.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:07.480]   I just thought as we look at the power of video, this is such a fantastic example of
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:09.560]   showing and not telling.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:14.880]   And it makes us realize how much more potential we have to tell stories.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:19.800]   And there's going to be a lot more of that because I did a whole segment on this as well.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:25.880]   So first of all, how did they do it? They're using Unreal Engine, which makes sense if you
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.760]   look at it, if you watch it, it's actually like, yeah, that kind of does look like my
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.040]   favorite role playing game.
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.000]   Right, game technology.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.360]   But then also, so the Weather Channel has invested, they only have the one studio now,
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:41.160]   but they've invested a whole bunch of money into creating more things like that.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.400]   They have a special studio with all the fancy motion tracking stuff, you know, to make
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:50.000]   golem and things like that and the green screens and all that stuff. And they're apparently
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:56.240]   going to roll out over the next several months or years or whatever. Many more of these,
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.840]   they wanted to get this one ready for the hurricane season.
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:04.800]   And they want to do because that's their whole point is not only, I think it's been
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:09.480]   viewed 10 million times on Twitter already, not only is it really compelling television,
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:11.400]   but you know, I'm a Florida native.
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:15.960]   So like, you know, I've dealt with hurricanes every year for my whole life. And the whole
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:19.960]   idea of is you always get those people that are like, well, I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:25.960]   Well, okay, here's what a 10 foot storm surge actually would do to your neighborhood.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.560]   And they're going to do more of these for things like how quickly a fire can move through
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:36.200]   a canyon or something like that. So the whole idea is when people are watching these weather
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:41.080]   or natural disaster events happen, and they're not really sure how seriously to take it
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:45.720]   they're trying to make people take it more seriously. And I think it's fantastic.
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:51.080]   I agree that this is like, oh, hey, oh, Dr. back. Yeah.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:55.440]   Somebody hit a pole. Apple tried to shut me down. But can nobody shut me down? I'm back.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:02.720]   So that being said, that's really cool. Graphics is really useful. But I remember today when
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.880]   Anderson Cooper was sitting in a ditch pretending like it was four feet more water than it was
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:12.280]   just the other day we had that guy who was bracing himself against the wind with people
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:16.520]   walking behind him. So that's why people don't leave their homes. That's why people stay there
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:21.240]   because they can't trust the media. I'm doing air quotes again because they do silly stuff
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:25.160]   like that to play up storms. And sometimes there is a real danger and you need to run
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:30.040]   for your life. But it's not every storm. It's not all the time. So as cool as that is as
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.720]   good as that is, you know, somebody's going to be sitting at home. Well, that's fake water.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:38.200]   And that doesn't look real to me. It's just the way that this guy right here. This is why people
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.920]   stay in their houses because they want stuff like this. And they're like, really, bro? What are you
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:46.920]   doing? And if you could find a clip of Anderson, I know it's 10 years old. But this dude is literally
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:51.240]   he walked downhill, stood in a ditch with waiters, did an interview, told him about how everything
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:56.920]   was flooding when literally was maybe up to his ankles. Okay, the guy that was in the wind. Okay,
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:00.840]   I'm not I'm just gonna play devil's advocate here because I don't know his backstory. But I'm
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:06.440]   just thinking maybe he's not fit. Maybe those like strapping gentlemen who were walking behind you.
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:12.040]   And also he's going he's going to a place where he's in the wind tunnel. Like having been through
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:17.720]   hurricanes before, like, if you're if you're around a wall and you see the wind, you're like, you're
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:23.000]   standing up, but then there is wind long enough or strong enough to knock me down. And I'm not a
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.160]   small guy either. And I've seen I've been to Chicago. I know it's obvious. I know what dying in my
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:35.560]   heart is. Okay, but that video right there ain't no wall. There's only an opportunity in air between
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:41.480]   those two guys. So I don't know strapping not about another. So again, there's gonna be people
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:46.360]   sitting at home. Johnny, look at the TV. They got fake dog foot water going up there telling me
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:52.760]   I'm going to try that's not even real water. Johnny. I get the answer to cover. Look at that.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:57.640]   And that's why people stay in their homes. That's why people don't leave because they don't believe
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:03.880]   that the storm is as bad as they say it's gonna be. And and her job risk, I'm leaving. I don't
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:11.240]   care what it is. You know, I'm not staying anything to spread the message on proper disaster preparedness
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:16.840]   when the hurricane lane was heading towards Hawaii, my parents live on Maui. And I was trying to
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:20.840]   convey to my parents that they needed to be prepared. And there had been discussion of
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:25.960]   three weeks of supplies and after Puerto Rico, everybody was freaking out. And I said to my mom,
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.760]   how do you feel about your preparedness? And she said, Oh, I'm good. I just got some bottles of water.
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:37.160]   They're in the in the garage. And I talked to my dad and he said, we have two six packs of
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:45.880]   Dasani in there. Is that what she's talking about? Oh, Lord have mercy. Yeah. And one more thing real
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:53.400]   quick, because I got I got power outage when I was gonna say it. Zuckerberg can't fix that kind
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:58.760]   of stuff. And he gonna mess up my memes. That's all I'm saying. Memes aren't meant to be real.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:02.600]   It's supposed to be fake news and jokes. So they go in there, search these words and messing up my
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.840]   memes. We gonna have a problem. That's what I'm saying back on that last story. But you keep going
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:10.840]   with that. Well, I'm glad you brought up memes because we're gonna take a very short break. And
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:16.440]   then we're gonna come back and talk about how the EU is really trying to mess up your memes. Oh,
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.640]   dog does so Leo, get us through this and then we'll get back to it. Becky, what do you do to secure
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:28.760]   your passwords? Huh? All you all you. I hope you're not using monkey 123 or a lot of people I know,
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:34.120]   I won't name names. Like we'll use a combination of their initials, their kids birth date, their
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:41.880]   dog's name, and call it a day. And then they use it for every site with maybe modifications,
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:48.360]   maybe not. This is not secure. You know this. And maybe you do better. But can I tell you
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:53.000]   something your employees are doing that right now. And that's why you need LastPass Enterprise
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000]   for your business is why we use LastPass Enterprise. You're giving your employees the
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.040]   keys to the kingdom. You need a little bit of security, a little help. LastPass is the password
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:09.080]   vault that protects you best at home and at work. According to one survey, 32% of employees
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:14.840]   share passwords with others. And by the way, not just the person sitting at the desk across from
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:22.280]   a people at home. Yeah, you got to protect yourself. What is what are you doing to ensure those
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:27.320]   passwords are being shared appropriately? Well, LastPass Enterprise, it makes password sharing
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:34.120]   easy for employees, but keeps access to corporate data secure. It even allows for full customization
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:40.440]   of act for of access like you could set master password requirements. So no more monkey 123
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:46.440]   enables password reset. So because employees inevitably they'll forget, but you have control
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:51.560]   of all of this. And by the way, if an employee leaves or no longer needs access to get their
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:55.720]   work done, you can easily revoke access to a password. They don't even see the password in some
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:59.880]   cases. Generally, this is what we do. They don't see the password. They just get a button to click
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:04.280]   the log on the site. It fills in the password. All they see is dots. So they can't share it.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.400]   They can't tell anybody else. They don't even know it themselves. I love that. LastPass has over
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:16.280]   100 policies, access security reports, you can create shared folders. We use it for everything
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:22.440]   database logins, SSH keys, software licenses, other important business information at home.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:27.640]   I use it for my drivers, licensed credit cards, social security number, everything's in LastPass
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:34.200]   because I trusted everything in LastPass is fully encrypted. No one has access even LastPass, only you
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:44.360]   and with the LastPass Authenticator app, you get multi-factor authentication. This is really nice.
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:48.840]   Actually, there are many ways of doing two-factor, but the LastPass app is not employees like that
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:54.280]   because they don't have to copy a six-digit number or anything. A verification button pops
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:00.280]   up on the employee's phone and that guarantees that only they are accessing this resource. That's
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:07.240]   very nice. Even if credentials are compromised or given away or shared, having that multi-factor
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:13.640]   authentication means outsiders don't have access, only authorize employees. Of course,
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:17.800]   the password generator, which makes sure that you're always using strong passwords and you don't
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:25.400]   have to write them down because LastPass remembers them for you. If you use Microsoft's Active Directory,
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.520]   you don't even have to remember the LastPass password. You can use your AD credentials to log in.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:38.040]   So really, then that's it. This is so good for business. We've been using LastPass Enterprise
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:43.560]   for years. I've been using LastPass Personal for years. In fact, almost 10 years, LastPass
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:49.640]   celebrated their 10th anniversary in July. Isn't that awesome? From easy onboarding to password
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:54.520]   autofill, LastPass makes it easy for businesses to take control of passwords, reduce the threat
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:51:03.880]   of breach. You need this for your business and it's very affordable. Go to lastpass.com/twit.
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:09.240]   Choose from LastPass Premium for personal use. LastPass Families is what I use at home,
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:14.600]   makes it easy to share passwords, have emergency access for spouses, things like that. LastPass
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:19.080]   Teams for Teams of 50 or fewer are what we use at work, LastPass Enterprise. I believe in LastPass
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:24.760]   so much that we actually give it as a benefit of employee to our employees for their personal
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:29.240]   use as well. And it integrates very nicely with the Enterprise. I just think it's that important.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:36.040]   I think you need to use it. LastPass.com/twit. More than 13 million people trust LastPass,
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:43.400]   including me and Steve Gibson. It's the number one most preferred password manager, LastPass.com/twit.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:51.320]   Have I convinced you I hope so. And now back to Becky Worley as we wrap up this week's
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:57.400]   Twit. I'll be back next week. See you then. We will indeed see you then Leo. In your absence,
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:03.400]   though, it has been a great week on Twit. Let's take a look. Previously on Twit.
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:08.040]   Oh, we got mail from Leo. He's been sending us postcards. You get one.
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:13.960]   These are so cool. On this one, he says, "Please tell Rich that he answered all of those questions."
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:21.560]   Wrong on the tech guy. Thank you. Appreciate that, Leo. Is this where you're listening, Leo?
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:29.400]   Tech news weekly. There's the iPhone XS, XS Max, XR. Although I want to say XS, XS,
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.480]   and the entire thing. I was going to compliment you on your proper pronunciation of these
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:38.200]   ridiculous things. Let me just say I have it actually written out in words so that I wouldn't
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:42.200]   mess it up. That's the only way that I could do it properly. What about the Apple Watch 4?
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:47.720]   Obviously, this was a big redesign. I think this was the most interesting product in some ways.
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:52.040]   It's got that big screen going all the way out to the edges. That's going to change how app
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:59.800]   developers write for it. The new screen savers. Richard Butler is here. He is from DP Reviews.
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:06.520]   Anon has jumped on the full-frame mirrorless bandwagon with a Canon EOS. Taking out that mirror
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:12.280]   means that you can move them out much closer to the sensor. Canon tells us that putting a large
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:17.160]   glass element very close to the sensor allows you to create all sorts of lens designs they
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:22.200]   couldn't with their DSLR system. And Nikon is saying very much the same thing. They've taken the
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:27.320]   same approach. Do you have a preference between the Nikon and the Canon? I don't know. I'm very
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:33.000]   competitive. All these controversial questions. Something has to win, always. That's my way.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:43.400]   Word Twit. H-G4. Hahahaha. Becky Worley here back on Twit. I was just checking Twitter. My
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:53.480]   handle is @bwerley. Follow a sister. That helps me out. Litch MD had a comment about the dual
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:57.640]   sims. He says, "I've had a personal line and a Google voice line for business for close to a
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:02.920]   decade. I've carried two phones to support this for years and now with dual sims on the Apple
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:09.400]   phone 10s, I can carry one phone and answer text, etc. on both." And you know, that's a good example.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:13.240]   He's a small business owner, so he's not worried about Big Brother, the employer,
[01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:18.600]   checking in on all his stuff. He just wants to carry one phone but have two numbers. Makes a lot
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:27.720]   of sense. We are joined by Mike Sargent, Brian McCullough, and Odocta, Olin, J.J. Stone. Thank
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:34.600]   you, gentlemen, for being with us. And this is kind of exciting news and policy, but I'm a big
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:41.240]   policy fan because I think change has only happened with markets, free markets, with government policy
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:45.800]   and occasionally with grassroots. Maybe I'm a little bit fatalistic in my thinking, but when a
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:51.240]   policy change happens, I think it's worth paying attention. So this one is from the EU. The European
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:58.120]   Parliament has voted to pass a copyright directive and the two that are in contention are Article 11
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:04.440]   and Article 13, the hyperlink tax and the upload filter. So I'll quickly hit the hyperlink tax because
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:09.080]   we don't need to get into that too much, although it does impact business. It would require companies
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:15.320]   to pay news outlets for hosting their content on the platforms. Basically, if you have a hyperlink,
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:21.160]   that's okay, but if you excerpt significant portions of the text, sites like Facebook,
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:30.840]   Google, Twitter could be forced to pay those companies for the content. And, you know, I think
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:36.680]   Megan and Jason were speaking with a guy from the EFF earlier this week, and he basically just said,
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:42.120]   "The EU is doing this because they're super mad." That was his exact quote, "At Google,
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.920]   Facebook and Twitter, they're super mad." And it's because they're not getting any revenue from
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:51.240]   these companies, and this is one of the ways that they can imagine bringing revenue back into
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:58.840]   European companies, media companies, who are, you know, as all media companies are suffering
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:04.680]   from sharing, it could be said. Now, this is the one that's interesting, and, oh, doctor, this is
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:11.000]   the one that's messing with your meme. This is the meme killer. It would require these big companies
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.920]   to automatically, anyone who has user-generated content, to automatically filter copyrighted
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:23.720]   material, songs, images, videos, unless it has been specifically licensed. Now, we know this exists
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:29.880]   already. You probably have seen this when, certainly for us here at Twit, when we podcast,
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:36.680]   we upload material that might have a song or a video or something that's copyrighted. It goes up
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:42.520]   onto YouTube, and YouTube takes it down because they have AI that recognizes the
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:47.880]   algorithmic signature of the material, and therefore can say, "Hey, that's copyrighted,
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:53.480]   and they don't own the copyright." But this has a ton of issues when it comes to fair use.
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:57:02.520]   This could be a big deal if it passes. It's not meant it wouldn't go into play until 2019,
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.200]   but this is a big deal if it goes in as we've seen with JPR.
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:12.120]   It only has one more vote. Everything I read about it, it's a done deal, essentially.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:18.120]   And then there's a complication where each individual EU country can implement it in different
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:26.280]   ways. It doesn't even have the advantage of it being one single law that you have to follow,
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:31.000]   but the key part about this is, so if you're thinking, "Well, this doesn't affect me. I'm not
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.520]   a YouTube. I'm not going to upload this." Well, this could affect you posting an animated GIF
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:45.800]   or whatever to a Facebook post, to an Instagram, to Twitter. And the key part about it is,
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:52.120]   I haven't read any piece that says this is possible. Everything I've read says that the only way that
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:58:00.280]   they can do this is to put the filter in front. So you could have a scenario where someone says
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:05.960]   something funny on whatever platform you want, and you want to respond with a funny future
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:11.000]   drama, animated GIF. But whatever platform you post to would have to run it through the algorithm
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:16.040]   before it could post it. And if they rejected it, they say, "Oh, this is not." And then you would
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:21.160]   get all sorts of problems where it's like, "But this is fair use. I'm just posting a-- this is just
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:27.480]   a joke or whatever." And then the political implications of having those filters. So it is
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:33.240]   potentially quietly our huge, huge story. And the fact that it's going to be implemented
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:37.640]   differently in different countries doesn't really matter. I always think of it like a three-legged race
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:42.360]   because when we're doing things at a global scale, whomever has the most restrictive policies,
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:47.640]   you have to adhere to that globally. Right, right. Exactly. That's a big thing there that people
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:53.080]   might go, "Oh, well, here in the US, Twitter's going to be OK. We'll still be able to do what we
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:58.760]   want to do in the United States. But if the company is going to go through this entire policy change
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:04.520]   and implement these tools and set this up, you have to because you would be communicating with
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:10.840]   people potentially from the countries where this is a law and you can't have it work in some places
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:18.280]   and work in others." And so it is kind of scary in the sense that it will change the-- I think
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:24.440]   it will change communication on the web in many ways. I mean, I don't see any other thing happening.
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:30.520]   Like this is going to happen, right? We've seen that these laws, like you said, it's pretty much
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:35.960]   through. There's one more vote in January, but everything I read this week says that it's a done
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:42.680]   deal. It's going to pass. This part of it already passed 438 to 266 against. So it wasn't close or
[01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:47.160]   anything. Potential ramifications. Do you have any perception of how this might impact things if
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:53.080]   it has the effect that we think it might? I mean, the EFF says that this could kill meme culture,
[01:59:53.080 --> 02:00:00.760]   essentially. So yeah, go ahead. Look, first of all, if I was in the EU, I worry about Facebook,
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:05.480]   Twitter, everybody blocking me from not sharing my sites before you trying to get money out of me
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:11.080]   spreading the business. Secondly, memes are a very crucial part of my bank account. I make a lot of
[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:16.200]   money with memes. So they shut down my memes. We got a problem. So this is why I'm saying that
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:22.280]   quietly, this is a big deal. Do you know, first of all, Kim Kardashian is Kim Kardashian because
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:28.520]   she was a meme before memes, remains. Okay. So when things happen, Drake has a song out. The song
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:34.200]   sucks. One kid does a dance to it. The whole world's got a hashtag. Dude, the shiggy dance. So you
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:41.960]   think you're going to stop? Okay. Let's say they stop it. The traffic will take such a hit from viral
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:46.360]   things not going around the web that all these companies are going to be like, look, what
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:53.880]   official we got to pay off to rewrite this look? So it ain't going to last long. The wave of traffic
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:01:01.080]   that memes and jokes and using the I want that Futurama, you know what I mean, take my money.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:03.960]   Like that stuff helps the internet. It helps all these things.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:09.000]   Yeah, but talk to ironically, ironically, that's the whole point is that the EU says it's doing
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:14.680]   this to protect the artists. So what you just described with Drake, ironically, they would be
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:21.320]   taking down those memes in order to protect Drake and theoretically give him more money.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:26.280]   Drake might not think so because Drake's a modern guy that's like, the game has changed. This is
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:31.640]   how I get publicity. But ironically, that's what they're trying to do. They're trying to set up
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:36.680]   this regime to protect the artists and to protect copyright owners. I watched the governments
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:42.280]   sit there and tell Jack Dorsey that people are selling opioids on Twitter and he needs to stop it.
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:45.480]   And that's what's problem with the world of opioid addiction. And he didn't want to talk
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:50.680]   about doctors writing prescriptions falsely for people like their candy and all the other things
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:56.680]   are wrong. The rules and regulations for pharmaceutical companies, he wanted to put it at Jack Dorsey's
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:02.040]   footsteps on Twitter for the opioids selling on Twitter. Those people are stupid. They don't
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:07.480]   understand how the internet works and what's going on and how things flow. So again, go ahead and
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:12.040]   make that law. Everybody in the world is going to tell you, I'm not selling as many albums I have.
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:17.800]   People aren't searching my old movie from 1976 because it somehow became popular again because
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:24.680]   some kid found it with his dad's DVD collection. Like, oh, I'm so upset about this. If it happens,
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:28.920]   again, it's going to personally affect my bank account. And that's going to be a problem. The
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:32.840]   memes got to live forever. But I feel like if they do shut them down, they're going to be right back.
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:35.080]   Memes going to be back in like a year. Memes can't never die.
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:39.400]   Brian, you said that this would only work if they filtered it on the front side.
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:44.120]   And I'm just thinking the lag that would cost. That's what I'm saying. Like,
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.240]   if we've talked about discouraging you from doing something. So what if, and that's the whole point
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:56.200]   of posting great GIF is you're like, Oh, I hate it when I think 30 seconds later of the perfect
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.480]   GIF to post because then someone will be just to it or you know, you know what I mean?
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:05.800]   So right. Like imagine a scenario where somebody posts something and you've got the perfect
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:10.920]   response and here's and you're scrolling through here's that and you submit it and then you get a
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:19.880]   little notification submitted for review. So gross. I hate it. I hate this.
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:25.320]   I'll tell you. I'll tell you the exact what you're talking about. So Apple does the video where
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:30.120]   they're showing the basketball tracking with the hoop, the guy shooting and going into net, right?
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:36.040]   I posted a meme of a kid crossing over his grandmother in the driveway. She falls over.
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:40.520]   I said, perfect case use. You get to track the motion of the basketball player and grandma gets
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:46.280]   life support from the Apple Watch series four and they got 39 hearts and 17 retweets. They
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:51.800]   couldn't live without me in these streets. They need tweets like me. They need gifts like me.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:55.400]   And I black off the EU. Ain't nobody going to England no more.
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:59.720]   Anybody. But there's a question. Do you think this will spur segmentation?
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:03.080]   Is there any way that that would be a technological response to this? I mean,
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:08.600]   we I just don't see how that works. This is the only thing to me that like has ever come close
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:14.200]   because we have the privacy regulations that got put into place and it makes it makes sense. Wow.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:24.760]   It didn't make sense, but it did make sense that we sort of made those a more universal thing.
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:30.440]   There were some companies and to this day that still don't have the exact same
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:34.440]   availabilities in the US that you have in other countries to like download your data.
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:37.240]   But for the most part, these companies were like, we're already doing this. Let's just go
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:45.320]   ahead and do it everywhere. This is something that everybody does want. This this judgment goes against
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:52.920]   like Tumblr culture, Twitter culture, Facebook, it goes against all of these cultures. Yeah,
[02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:57.000]   Tumblr would be gone. I mean, Tumblr has kind of already had some troubles now that's with Yahoo.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:02.120]   But the point is like all of these places exist because of those things and the way that we
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:08.600]   communicate with each other online using these different forms of media, it's so it goes against
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:14.040]   not just these companies, but the users that are using these platforms. And so this would be the
[02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:19.480]   thing that I could actually see being a segmentation like, Oh, well, we know you're in the UK now,
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:24.680]   so you can't send out any animated images while you're here because they all literally come from
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:31.640]   someplace somewhere. And you're like, like everybody now has to hire a lawyer so they can make copyright,
[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:37.720]   fair use claims. It's ridiculous. I'll give one more example because this is the one that I read
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:42.200]   when this was first being talked about this summer, the World Cup was going on. So let's imagine this
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:48.360]   scenario. The World Cup's going on. A billion people are watching in real time and Ronaldo
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:52.920]   falls on his butt and it's hilarious. And so you want to go to Reddit immediately and find that
[02:05:52.920 --> 02:06:00.200]   that that Jeff. Well, so that sort of immediacy could be completely killed because maybe eventually
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:07.240]   FIFA would say, OK, it's fine to use that three second clip. But someone as powerful as FIFA,
[02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:11.720]   theoretically Facebook and Reddit and Twitter and everyone would have to go get permission first
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:16.200]   before they could even allow it on their platform. And those kind of organizations just don't move
[02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:25.000]   at that speed. So the moment is gone and the it's it's yeah. I think this is, you know, GDPR at least
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.760]   was medicine that we knew we should probably take and these companies are like, Oh, we don't
[02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:33.000]   want to do it. But if we have to do it, we'll do it. This just seems like a spanking for something
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.200]   that you didn't actually do or that doesn't really make sense. As far as I'm concerned,
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:43.640]   EU, you're dead to me. And anybody want to open up a VPN set out there and make that guapolet go
[02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:48.360]   right ahead because we cut off everything. Y'all can't tweet. Y'all can't Facebook. Y'all can't
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:55.720]   knock me. Forever me. Guy. Me me. There's going to be a revolt. Huh? All that they'll be cut off
[02:06:55.720 --> 02:07:01.400]   from all of the all the big sites and they'll let their their ministers in parliament know that
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:05.560]   this wasn't a good one. I want to go to one other three-legged race that's kind of interesting.
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:16.440]   California is going to put into law. State bill 327. This is the Internet of Things Security bill.
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:25.640]   And the idea is that it's going to force IOT makers to put in basic security measures. We know that
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:31.560]   it's the Wild West out there for IOT devices. If the device uses a default password,
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:36.280]   the password has to be unique to each device. That's kind of interesting. Or it has to prompt
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:42.200]   users to set up their own password when they set it up for the first time. A couple of different
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:51.400]   other security elements. But again, going back to the three-legged race, the paradigm for this
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:58.360]   is the California Air Resources Board passing the SMOG law, which forced car makers to reduce
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:04.680]   emissions. And that really set in motion a nationwide and eventually improved global
[02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:10.360]   air quality standards because California started it. And if you're going to sell to California,
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:14.840]   you might as well make all your products that way. So, you know, I think this is just another
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:19.160]   good example of policy having an impact. We don't have to talk about that one. There's a couple
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:24.920]   other things. This is kind of my take it or leave it section where you guys can decide if you want
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:31.320]   to talk about this or not. Google Pixel 3 event will take place October 9th. Pixel 3.
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:37.240]   Anybody? Can happen in New York? I can't wait. I can't wait to see all the stuff that Apple's
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:42.360]   going to announce next year that they stole from the picture. So, watching the Pixel event,
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:46.280]   let's me know what Apple's going to be doing next year when they roll out their same pitch that
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:53.400]   they've been doing for the last seven years. So, this is sort of related, but my wife is completely,
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:09:00.760]   she's still on a C, a 5C. She doesn't want a bigger phone. So, she has announced she is off Apple.
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:07.080]   And so, I told her to watch this event. I'm pushing the Pixel because even though there's not a lot
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:13.000]   of small Android phones out there, I feel like if she could get the smaller, cheaper Pixel, that
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:18.840]   might satisfy her need for a pocketable small phone. All right. Next,
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:24.280]   in my take it or leave it round, Google says it's going to discontinue the email app inbox.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:27.880]   I didn't, I was having news this very much, but just the news that it was going away. I went
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:34.440]   and checked it out. It's pretty sleek. Most of the features are now in Gmail, but inbox itself is
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:40.200]   going to go away. Take it or leave it, gentlemen. People get really sad about their email apps going
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:47.880]   away. I remember using mailbox all those years ago. And when mailbox got shut down, it was heartbreaking.
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:53.400]   And I've seen some people being sad about inbox going away. I understand like you get used to
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:59.000]   using something each day. And particularly when it's different, it's not as if you can just hop
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:04.680]   into something new and it does the exact same thing for you. These are typically designed in a
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:09.240]   different way and are interesting and you get used to them. And then it's like, oh, I just have to go
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:15.720]   back to the default mail app. What am I going to do? So I feel your pain if you're losing inbox.
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:22.440]   And hopefully the way that Gmail is designed now works for you. But in any case, I'm pouring
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.400]   one out with you. So sorry inbox. I can say is who moved my cheese?
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:34.040]   So are changed and the way the new Chrome update is really buggy for me right now. I don't know if
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:38.680]   it's for anybody else. But Google, you got so much money. Why are you making nerds
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:43.800]   sad? This is like for people that are nerds. My timeline was flooded with people crying and
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:47.560]   wanting to stab Google in the back. That's what they do. Yeah, but listen, if you're a nerd,
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:53.800]   you should know by now Google will kill every product that you love. They will buy the company,
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:55.960]   they'll keep it going for five years and then they'll kill it.
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:01.560]   They know about a bad girlfriend just breaking your heart. They come back talking like they
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:05.240]   sweet. Then they think, you know, they stab you back. I know this will do good. But stop it.
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:09.960]   Google leave me something. I still use Thunderbird email. Thunderbird ain't never going to die
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:14.600]   because I'm so nice. So do I do that? Yeah, see, see, yeah. Thunderbird, shout out to the Thunderbird
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:21.240]   crew. I got emails from Oh, wait, I never gave her the Thunderbird. I log in every month,
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:25.880]   back up my stuff and then log back offline Thunderbird for life. They own you. Oh, doctor.
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:29.240]   Take it to leave it. I'll cry. Take it to leave it around.
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:34.760]   Continue's Jack Moss stepping down from Alibaba business story. Does this impact
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:40.920]   technology in general? Do we care? I mean, it's a stuff. Yeah, it's an e-commerce thing. I mean,
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:47.000]   it's it's it's epochal in the sense that he was the first of this modern generation of Chinese
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:53.720]   internet entrepreneurs to really crack it and make it big. So like, he's he's retiring earlier
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:57.800]   than Bill Gates retired to do philanthropy. He says he wants to do philanthropy like Bill Gates does.
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:00.360]   So hey, God bless. All right. Yeah. There you go.
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:08.280]   Ikea has decided to get into the gaming market. They want to create a chair for you to game in
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:14.760]   and the way they're going to make it special is they're going to 3D scan your butt and then
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:23.080]   they're going to make you a chair that is perfectly contoured to every dimple and every shape
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:28.600]   distortion of your tush. Is this the sign that the apocalypse is upon us?
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:35.320]   No, not at all. This is fantastic. I think this is such a great idea. People sit in chairs all day,
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:41.000]   every day. They sit on stools. They sit. I mean, there's so many uncomfortable chairs out there.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.880]   This one is personally designed for me and I'm going to feel comfortable in it. Like,
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:51.080]   there's there's so many issues with folks who don't know sort of posture, the necessary posture
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:54.360]   for sitting at a desk and where their arms should be, where the screen should be.
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:01.560]   If we can provide some form of relief by providing this perfectly shaped, perfectly contoured
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:07.720]   stool on which to sit, I think it's fantastic. So I think this is the opposite of the apocalypse.
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:14.040]   This is like, as we improve in these new technologies that we're using like 3D printing,
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:19.160]   we can make things more custom for individuals and more personalized. And so then they're less
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:23.880]   likely to get thrown away. They're less likely to not be something that we want. They're less
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:29.880]   like there. This was literally made for me and for my tuckus. And it is the modern
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:36.520]   sitting on a scanner in the office and having your butt scape.
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:37.480]   Ask it 2000.
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:44.760]   This is a billion dollar business. Okay, first of all, when I'm on my bicycle, when I'm on my
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:49.960]   spin machine, when I make my own bar card, it fits you great. And I have like four or
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:53.880]   five different butt sets and you can find your perfect butt seat to sit up at the bar in the
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:57.880]   stool. You know, when you sit in the stool, it sucks. But if it felt your butt, oh, it'd be great.
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:02.840]   Man, this is a great idea. I can't wait to get my butt seat customized and made for me. I might
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:07.320]   get it in my car. Oh, imagine a customized butt seat way of vehicle. This is ingenious.
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:15.480]   You guys have any other take your leave topics that you wanted to discuss? Did we hit everything
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:22.200]   that we need to talk about for this week in tech? I think we did. All right. Well, gentlemen,
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:30.280]   it has been a true pleasure. Brian McCullough is joining us from the Tech meme ride home podcast.
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:35.480]   He is the author of how the internet happened, a book that's coming out in October. Where can

[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:33.400]   Well, I have two Chihuahuas that I love very much and I'm a big coffee drinker and my boss,
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:38.520]   Renee Ritchie, we were doing a podcast and he's like, you need to own the domain,
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:43.880]   chihuahua.coffee. And I bought it during the show. I was like, obviously, I do. So now it's become
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:49.320]   the thing that I send everyone to. I had a boss who suggested that my website be
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:56.280]   Wirly Wide Web. And I didn't take them up on that fantastic offer, but you were smart enough
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:58.920]   to get Chihuahua.coffee. I did. I have to.
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:04.360]   My W.W.W.W.W.W.W.E.D. has not really taken off, sadly. Oh, doctor,
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:11.000]   Owen J.J. Stone, the Memoji podcast. I don't know if this has ever been done in this week in
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:18.440]   tech history, an entire podcast done via Memoji. Your cute bright-eyed Hello Kitty face. Thank
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:23.640]   you for joining us. Let me talk to the people. First of all, tomorrow, dropping situational
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:28.520]   awareness podcast with my daughter. We talk about being an engine, fighting and escaping
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:32.440]   gun shootings in schools and how you should live your life and be prepared. That's going to be great.
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:38.120]   Secondly, a whole lot of tech shows I put up on iqmz.com. But most importantly, tweet me at
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:43.400]   Oh, doctor, ask me any questions you want. Just say hi. If you ask me questions, I will reply to you
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:48.440]   with a Memoji. I spend the time making videos for all the people that tweet me and ask me something
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:53.960]   because that's how much I love the tweet listeners. I'm here for you. I'm excited. Tim, call me because
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:58.120]   next year, y'all going to amp up and get a good this morning's excitement in the show. And I think
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:02.200]   my Memoji might be the thing that pushes y'all over the job. You know what I'm saying?
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:07.320]   Here's what I think we need to do. You and I, this is going to be my plan for aging gracefully on
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:12.040]   television is you and I are going to have a Memoji dating show. It's going to be like,
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:17.480]   I don't know, some combination of what was the one where they had the bachelor, like bachelor one.
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:25.320]   And then at the end, we reveal what everybody looks like in real life. It really is the greatest
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:29.080]   idea. Let's do this. That would be so much fun. Even if we just did it for a one-hour special and
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:33.720]   got a bajillion views. I can see Apple picking that up for their like TV thing that they're trying
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:37.800]   to do. That's better than all the shows they put out their Apple tip-cut car.
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:44.360]   You have to pick the bachelor. It's like the, what was it called? What was that show where you had
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:49.320]   three bad babies? Oh, yeah. And then bachelor number one. Bachelor number two. Yeah, bachelor number
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:54.200]   number two. But now it's going to be in Memojis and you pick the one you like based on their
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:18:00.040]   emoji persona. And then you reveal at the end and they go on a real date. I think we've got
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:05.720]   something gentlemen. This is the thing. I take it. I'm investing. Okay, good. We've got investors,
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:09.080]   we've got hosts. This is happening. And another Twit is in the can.
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:19.560]   Do the Twit. All right. Do the Twit, baby. Do the Twit. All right. Do the Twit.
